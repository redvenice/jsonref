Trump has agreed to meet Kim for a historic US-North Korean summit as soon as next month, but Pyongyang has never officially confirmed its offer of denuclearization talksAs officials in Washington scrambled to prepare for the prospective meeting, the weeks-long silence had reportedly made the White House nervous that Seoul had overstated the North\u0027s willingness to negotiate over its own nuclear arsenal.Kim\u0027s remarks on Monday break that public silence, although he did not specifically refer to a \u0027summit\u0027 with Trump.Following multiple media reports of back-channel talks between the Cold War rivals, Trump said on Monday he planned to meet Kim in \u0027May or early June.\u0027\u0027I think there will be great respect paid by both parties and hopefully there will be a deal on denuking,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Hopefully it will be a relationship that will be much different than it has been for many, many years.\u0027Trump says he\u0027ll meet with Kim Jong un in May or early June...North Korea tells the U.S. it is prepared to discuss...Share this articleNorth Korea\u0027s recent surge in diplomatic activity marks a stunning turnaround after a year of heightened tensions which saw the North fire multiple missiles and carry out its most powerful nuclear test, further isolating the regime and triggering a fiery war of words with Trump.Since sending a high-profile delegation along with athletes to the Winter Games in the South in February, Kim has made his international debut with a visit to Beijing, his first overseas trip since taking power in 2011.The North\u0027s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho arrived in Moscow on Monday after making stops in Beijing, Azerbaijan and other former Soviet republics.Ri also paid a visit last month to Sweden, which acts as a diplomatic go-between for Washington and Pyongyang.          At the meeting of party officials Monday, Kim discussed the \u0027development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-US dialogue\u0027If the summit does take place, many remain skeptical about the whether a meeting between the two notoriously unpredictable leaders can succeed.It is scheduled to take place without the months of groundwork that usually precedes such meetings.No specifics have yet emerged concerning the date or venue of the proposed summit, with a third country such as Mongolia or Sweden under consideration to host the talks, according to multiple reports.Beyond that, a detailed agenda for the talks will need to be set.Washington\u0027s long-held stance is that it will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. That means it wants to see \u0027complete, verifiable, and irreversible\u0027 denuclearize, which is a very high bar from North Korea\u0027s perspective.The North has previously demanded the withdrawal of US troops based in the South and the end of the security alliance between Seoul and Washington, which is an extraordinary concession that it is hard to imagine any previous US president agreeing to."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/14/4AFAE67500000578-0-image-m-6_1523279752997.jpg","title":"Adorable toddler hides crisps underneath blanket hilarious attempt avoid sharing them","story":"    The tiny tot (pictured) was intent on having her snacks all to herselfShe looks around, making sure the coast is clear, then goes for it.She takes a large handful of crisps and shoves them into her mouth.Then, without a word, she places the open packet back under the blanket. All throughout, the person holding the camera, presumed to be the parent,  tries to suppress bouts of laughter.It remains unclear exactly where the video was filmed."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/09/4B009A3800000578-5598065-image-a-25_1523350542020.jpg","title":"Incredible 3D printed bungalow built scratch 15 hours","story":"    The team behind the printer are working to increase the size of the houses to several storeysRemarkable footage of the printer at work show it remotely laying concrete as it piles up the walls of the house.  Working from the ground up, the machine layers concrete in a rectangular template until the shell of a bungalow begins to form.The jaw-dropping technique leaves the building with a unique stripey pattern on its outer walls.Co-founder of Be More 3D, Vicente Ramirez, told reporters: \u0027This process allows us to reduce the costs of the building of houses by up to 35 per cent, saving time and minimising the pollution and labour risks that are caused by building.\u0027Building a house can be done in eight hours by turning up the speed of the machine.\u0027Mr Ramires also revealed his team are working to increase the size of the houses they are creating to incorporate several storeys.

Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.\u0027The row comes as the UK marks the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought decades of sectarian violence and bloodshed to an end.  But Northern Ireland is again in a political crisis after powersharing collapsed over a year ago.The DUP and Sinn Fein have been at loggerheads over a range of issues including a proposed Irish language Act. And No10 has warned that Westminster could have to step in and impose direct rule on the region for the first time in more than a decade. Mr Blair today said Theresa May must give the Northern Ireland peace process her \u0027full focus\u0027 to end the current impasse, Tony Blair warned today.The ex-Labour PM said the Good Friday Agreement had been the start of a long journey away from the Troubles.And he warned that the process still needed the \u0027full focus\u0027 of the current Prime Minister at the most crucial moments.Devolved powersharing in Belfast has been on ice for more than a year after a breakdown in relations between the Unionist DUP and Republican Sinn Fein.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has warned that the hand of history will be \u0027heavy and unforgiving\u0027 if Brexit is allowed to \u0027undermine\u0027 the Good Friday Agreement.           Tony Blair voiced disbelief at the remark made by Barry Gardiner, saying \u0027I don\u0027t know how anyone can say that\u0027The former US secretary of state - whose husband Bill helped create the 1998 peace deal, which was signed 20 years ago today - said that reinstating a hard border would be an \u0027enormous setback\u0027 that could lead to a return to the \u0027bad old days\u0027.Britain and the EU are yet to find a solution to the question of whether there will be a hard border between the UK and Ireland after Brexit. Progress is due by the summer and failure strike an agreement acceptable to Dublin could scupper hopes of any deal at the crucial October summit. Mr Corbyn  said: \u0027The Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail. It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.\u0027No one wants to be marking the twentieth anniversary of the agreement while the assembly at Stormont remains suspended. Efforts must be redoubled to restore the assembly, and to ensure a lasting open border as part of the Brexit negotiations.\u0027There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.\u0027The history of Ireland is a great teacher of oppression and brutality, imagination and poetry. For Irish communities everywhere – including in my own constituency – the Good Friday Agreement will always embody their hopes for peace and justice. We must cherish and learn from it for the future.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/00/03F2B940000003E8-0-image-m-45_1523316587730.jpg","title":"Museum Brexit announced","story":"Brexit trade boost as Danish and Swedish leaders push for an...Share this article\u0027In 40 years time people will think everyone we know was on the other side, as was the academic research, so how did this happen?\u0027Unless we start collecting material now we won\u0027t be able to educate people - especially the first 15 years or so where there are no digital records.

But what is the Belfast Agreement?What is the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement helped to end 30 years of sectarian conflict, that were also known as \u0027The Troubles\u0027. This conflict began when Northern Ireland separated from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s and away from British rule.Northern Ireland was then ided in two groups, the Unionists or the Loyalists, who wanted to remain a part of the UK and the Nationalists or the Republicans, who preferred the independence. Catholics protested after being discriminated against in the predominantly Protestant north and from the 1970s, violence erupted between armed groups on both sides. British troops were sent to the area, but came up against the largest of the Republican groups, the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.The IRA bombed areas of Britain and Northern Ireland and Loyalists in groups like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also responsible for many deaths. In 1972, the situation became markedly more serious as the IRA began targeting police officers and British army soldiers on the street.  Davis: The border impasse has become harder to resolve since Leo Varadkar became Irish PM14 people were killed by British troops during a peaceful protest led by the Catholics and Republicans in Derry and in a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, dampening hope that Northern Ireland would ever be peaceful again.However, in the 1990s, the IRA announced a ceasefire and after two years of discussions and 30 years of the Troubles, the Good Friday agreement was signed.A new government was formed with power being shared between the Unionists and the Nationalists in a group called the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was sent a copy of the agreement before the referendum was held in May 1998.The two countries voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December. However, those who were against the peace, continued violence and in 2002, the Assembly was suspended and the UK government had to take over decision-making.In 2007, power was returned and the British army ended its operations in Northern Ireland, but ten years later, the deal collapsed and has yet to be restored.When was the Belfast Agreement signed?The Belfast Agreement was signed on Friday, April 10, 1998 at 5:30pm and on the day the deal was reached, US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell stated: ‘I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached an agreement.’Who signed the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin member Martin McGuinness and Labour Party politician Marjorie \u0027Mo\u0027 Mowlam.          David Davis said the Irish government had been influenced by Sinn Féin in its Brexit policyWhy did the DUP oppose the Belfast Agreement?Despite the GFA deal gaining widespread support across Ireland, Ian Paisley’s DUP was the only major party to oppose it, believing it would scupper a union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.However, distrust between parties caused problems when the agreement was first put in place, but Tony Blair managed to win over Ian Paisley. Issues also arose in 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Fein deputy first minister after accusing the DUP of ‘arrogance’ while handling an energy scheme.The DUP’s Arlene Foster resigned and the Assembly collapsed, with McGuinness dying later in March 2017. Despite offers of help from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the DUP and Sinn Fein remain at loggerheads.Speaking in Belfast on April 10 2018, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that he was ‘right to oppose’ the Belfast Agreement.‘Most people when they talk about the Belfast Agreement are talking about a wider process - it seems to have taken on some of the events that took place almost four years before it and every agreement that happened afterwards.‘So if we are talking about a process that has at its heart compromise, partnership, people working together to make progress, then I think the whole community should support that. The specifics of the Belfast Agreement itself, clearly I opposed - I think I was right in opposing it.’Does the Tory-DUP alliance affect the Good Friday Agreement? Despite the UK government remaining impartial when dealing with the unionists and the nationalists, a direct alliance with the DUP would change this. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that a Tory-DUP alliance would lead to a \u0027coalition of chaos\u0027 and could put the GFA at risk. Alongside this, when writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Powell, the chief negotiator at the Belfast Agreement talks, said that the partnership was \u0027a terrible mistake with lasting consequences\u0027 that \u0027would risk undermining 20 years of hard work\u0027.Will Brexit be affected by the Belfast Agreement?Brexit secretary David Davis\u0027s comments about the Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin in Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could present some issues if a hard border is proposed. While Britain, Ireland and the EU have all stated that they want to avoid a hard border, many believe this is not possible with Theresa May\u0027s promise of a frictionless border while also leaving the EU customs border.While the DUP oppose a united Ireland as an alternative to remaining in the EU, Sinn Fein are touting it and officials fear that a return to before the Good Friday Agreement could occur, according to The Guardian. Former US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell warned that direct rule and a hard border could lead to a return of the violence seen from the 1970s on BBC\u0027s Today programme. George Mitchell said that a hard border would result in \u0027stereotyping resuming, demonisation resuming and people turn inward\u0027, and a lack of power-sharing could lead to \u0027regressive forces\u0027 becoming violent again.Leaders should see this as a \u0027dangerous signal...and act before there is a regression,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/16/4AE6AF5700000578-0-image-m-26_1523372505408.jpg","title":"The ruble plummets second straight day","story":"    Russia\u0027s central bank on Tuesday sought to reassure the public after new US sanctions prompted a market collapse and plunge in the ruble\u0027s valueThe US move prompted the ruble to fall on Monday and on Tuesday it fell to lows against the euro and US dollar not seen since 2016.The euro exceeded 78 rubles for the first time since April 2016 and the dollar went over 63 rubles for the first time since December 2016 on the Moscow foreign exchange market on Tuesday.\u0027The central bank has a broad spectrum of instruments in order to act in such situations, if risks arise to financial stability.

The US move prompted the ruble to fall on Monday and on Tuesday it fell to lows against the euro and US dollar not seen since 2016 The new US sanctions were announced to punish Russia for alleged attempts to subvert Western democracies. They focus on 24 iniduals and their companies and ban them from doing business with Americans. These include seven so-called oligarchs close to the Kremlin.The founder of metals giant Rusal, billionaire Oleg Deripaska, as a result saw his group lose half its value on Monday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.The Kremlin sought to dampen the impact of the US moves, so as to avoid spreading panic.\u0027These things happen,\u0027 said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, predicting that the situation would adjust itself later.Russia is watching the situation closely and will deliver a solution that is in the country\u0027s own interests, Peskov said.On Monday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had promised support for companies hit by sanctions.\u0027The main thing now is to minimise this uncertainty, primarily by ensuring the stable and calm functioning of the companies where hundreds of thousands work,\u0027 deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said.\u0027We will understand later if further measures are needed,\u0027 he said. \u0027Under previous sanctions, we found the right instruments to stabilise (the economy) and reduce the impact,\u0027Economy minister Oreshkin even said that the situation was a \u0027good test\u0027 of the macroeconomic policies of the government and central bank in recent years.The ruble\u0027s \u0027freely floating exchange rate absorbs shocks,\u0027 he added.The authorities have sought to minimise the reaction to the latest wave of sanctions in comparison with the economic turbulence of recent years.\u0027Despite the very complex geopolitical situation, we preserve a certain international presence.. unlike in the 1990s when only the boldest ventured onto the Russian market,\u0027 said Alexander Afanasyev, the head of the Moscow Exchange who organised the forum.Businessman and banker Oleg Tinkov put on a brave face, telling journalists: \u0027Yesterday I lost $250 million in a day.

It’s madness.”She hopes the thousands of travellers arriving every day by Eurostar from mainland Europe into the soaring 19th-century station will read her words, which were unveiled on Tuesday, and feel the love.“I don’t personally want to leave Europe at all – and this is my message to all Europeans. I love Europe. I’m not saying there are no problems with Europe, of course there are, so many of them, but it’s so much easier to sort problems from the inside.”Emin said the sentence had come straight into her mind, but it had taken a year to create the largest so far of what have become trademark works spelling out her texts in her own handwriting.“It looks effortless, it looks really simple but health and safety … believe me, it was really difficult. The main thing is the train drivers coming in must not be shocked, and so you can’t use some colours, no red or green or yellow.”Health and safety meant the letters had to use LEDs rather than her usual neon, but they were always going to be pink, she said.“At night the whole station will be bathed in a pink light, and it will make people happy, I promise you, it will make people smile because pink will make them feel good.”Interviewed on the BBC’s Today programme, Emin gave no more clues about her weekend revelation that she had once been sexually assaulted by “a well-known female artist” who had attempted to grab her crotch at a party. Emin had responded by threatening to “punch her lights out”. Women should have the confidence to respond to any such assault at the time, she told John Humphrys: “I shouted and I caused such a scene, and I told everybody what she had done, much to their humiliation and embarrassment. I don’t think they’ll be doing that again in a hurry.”“Everybody is making accusations and saying things about men, but it happens with everybody in many different circumstances – people don’t seem to be seeing the whole picture that harassment is actually bullying in a lot of cases as well.”The St Pancras light work is a commission from the station owner and the Royal Academy, and will be seen by an estimated 50 million travellers over the year. Tim Marlow, the artistic director of the Royal Academy, called Emin one of the most important and influential artists in the world. “Her work is intense and compelling and blurs the boundaries between the personal and the public and between art and life,” he said.After time in the station Emin said she hoped the piece might find a home in Europe – or in her native Margate.Apart from wrapping her arms around Europe, Emin said she hoped one day her words could have a more personal resonance: “I desperately hope to be met at the train station in a really romantic way – one day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab94debefd53c3e514dc95b64e75a599e2aef1f6/0_0_6248_4144/master/6248.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6ebb060d7ba622974dd3d82b9043ac97 2020w","title":"a rosy future nestle launches pink kitkats with ruby chocolate","story":"Swiss experts spent decade developing naturally coloured cocoa on sale in UK this weekThe chocolate coating is an Instagrammable lurid lipstick pink with the promise of a unique “intense fruity taste”.UK consumers will next week be the first in Europe able to buy Nestlé’s four-finger KitKat, made with so-called ruby chocolate from specially selected cocoa beans.KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this innovative but “naturally coloured” new chocolate, made from ruby cocoa beans grown in the Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Brazil. It was created by Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut - the world’s largest cocoa processor - which spent more than a decade unlocking and experimenting with the beans’ colours and flavours. The flavour is described by the company as “a tension between berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness” but no extra colours or flavours are added to create the pinky hue, which instead comes from a powder extracted during the processing. It is not as sweet as milk chocolate, according to its creators, with a lighter flavour instead.Ruby chocolate – a fourth chocolate after traditional dark, milk and white – has been attracting huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September last year. It is claimed to be the first new natural colour for chocolate since Nestlé unveiled white chocolate more than 80 years ago.The new KitKat was introduced earlier this year in Japan and Korea, where consumers are no strangers to unusual variations of the popular confectionery. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi. In the UK it will go on sale in branches of Tesco on 16 April. “We know that a new type of KitKat is a really big deal and we are very excited to be able to offer a different type of chocolate for fans to try” said Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestlé’s UK confectionery business. “Ruby chocolate is a big innovation in confectionery and we are very proud that KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this exciting new chocolate.”Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, said: “I am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestlé – the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate. Consumers across the world will be intrigued by the unique taste of this crispy delight.”Following the UK launch, the product will go on sale across Europe and the US.

Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

In the most recent edition, Melbourne was declared the world’s most liveable city for the seventh year running, with Adelaide fifth, Perth seventh, Sydney 11th and Brisbane 16th.Yet from long commutes and high car dependency to the low provision of affordable housing in the more appealing areas, Australian cities still have plenty of room for improvement.The Centre for Urban Research’s Creating Liveable Cities in Australia report provides the first baseline measure of liveability in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. The result of five years of research, it examines walkability, public transport, public open spaces, housing affordability, commuting and access to food and alcohol.The walkability index combines dwelling density, daily-living destinations and street connectivity. It showed that a minority of residents in Australians cities live in walkable communities. With few exceptions, walkability is generally concentrated in inner suburbs. Despite the health and environmental benefits of walking, Australian cities are still being designed for cars. One notable exception was found: some new, walkable areas being built in outer-suburban Perth.In Sydney and Brisbane particularly, housing affordability stress is spread across large areas of the city. However, in all cities, those suburbs enduring the greatest stress were located towards the urban fringe. Given that outer suburbs also have poor access to public transport, and are less likely to be walkable, household expenditure on cars is likely to be higher there than in other areas. This suggests that continued suburban expansion will not improve housing affordability. Unlike other indicators of liveability, outer suburban areas mostly have better access to public open space than inner-city areas. Across Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, there are more fast-food outlets on average than supermarkets within 3.2km of residents’ homes.Previous research has shown that in Melbourne the density of off-licences in disadvantaged areas corresponded to poorer self-rated health. This reflects other Australian research showing that the density of alcohol outlets is associated with harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence, and that more alcohol outlets appear to be located in more disadvantaged areas.Due to difficulties in obtaining alcohol data, these indicators were created for only four cities: Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.

There was, however, no euphoria. This was partly\u0026nbspbecause everyone knew the conflict that was being brought to an end had been slow and sordid. It had been allowed to drag on long after victory for any side had become an obvious impossibility. There was too much sorrow, too many lives lost or blighted for no purpose, for unabashed exultation to be either warranted or decent.But there was also a better, nobler reason for the absence of real jubilation. The agreement wasn’t about\u0026nbspwinning. Its signing was not one of those epic, historic moments when a Bastille falls or a wall is torn down. It was, in fact, the exact opposite: a mutual acceptance that no such millennial moments were in prospect for anyone. There was not going to be a grand\u0026nbspceremony when all the union jacks were hauled down and the British army marched off to the ports, never to return. Neither was there going to be a surrender of the IRA, an abject renunciation of the demands of Irish nationalism.On the contrary, what the agreement was really about was devising a way for everyone to get over the loss of such dreams of once-and-for-all victories. It set an example that might have done a great service to the rest of Britain. But as Barry Gardiner’s characterisation of the agreement as a shibboleth, and the constant drumbeat of dismissiveness from pro-Brexit extremists have made clear, that lesson has yet to be learned.The genius of the agreement was that it took an unanswerable question and changed it. The unanswerable question was: what are you prepared to die for? A United Kingdom or a United Ireland? They were mutually exclusive concepts. The new question was not what are you prepared to die for, but what are you willing to live with.The Good Friday gamble was that people could live with complexity, contingency, ambiguity. Twenty years on, in a world that is spinning backwards into the worst kind of identity politics, the agreement seems to matter even more than it did in 1998, precisely because it makes tolerance of uncertainty the great civic virtue.Part of that uncertainty lay with the agreement’s own moral ambiguity. There is no hiding the fact that it made concessions to killers, including the release from prison of some mass murderers. Nor is there any point in denying that its provisions for the internal governance of Northern Ireland actually exaggerated and institutionalised sectarian isions. The language of “parity of esteem” between “two traditions” – Protestantunionist versus Catholicnationalist – essentially ignored\u0026nbspthe third tradition of those who did not wish to be defined by these tribal categories.And the cost of this has been huge. The middle ground from which the agreement itself came has been narrowed. The moral and intellectual architect of the agreement, John Hume, had to watch his own Social Democratic and Labour party be eaten up by Sinn Féin. On the other side, David Trimble’s Ulster Unionist party, which signed the agreement, has been displaced by the Democratic Unionist party, which did not. “Parity\u0026nbspof esteem” quickly came to be translated into a logic of tribal competition that has undermined the very institutions it was meant to sustain.These problems need to be addressed, and if it were not for the crazy distractions of Brexit, the 20th anniversary would be a very good occasion for a fundamental review of the agreement’s internal workings. They should not, however, detract from the boldness, radicalism and imaginative brilliance of the agreement as a whole. It did something that sovereign\u0026nbspgovernments had not done before, which is to create a political space that is claimed by nobody – a space, moreover, that exists not in a physical territory but inside people’s heads.At the core of the agreement is its statement that people born in Northern Ireland have an absolute right to be “Irish or British or both as they may so choose”. We have here, written down in a binding international treaty, a recognition that national identity is not a territorial or genetic imperative, and is not necessarily a single thing. It is chosen, and therefore open to a change of mind. And it can be multiple: those six letters – “or both” – are the glory of the agreement, its promise and its\u0026nbspchallenge.The agreement tries to replace eitheror with bothand. It comes from the bitter knowledge that eitheror – Catholic or Protestant, unionist or nationalist, Irish or British, them or us, victory or defeat – is a deadly option. It holds up a notion of purity that is neither attainable in practice nor desirable in principle. Bothand pushes away the illusory satisfactions of purity and seeks out the common decency of everyday life, in which we all live with complex ideas of belonging.What we did not imagine 20 years ago was that the pursuit of a pure identity would return as a governing\u0026nbspproject – not in Northern Ireland, but in England. We could not have foreseen that the euphoria of victory would animate politics on these islands again. It seemed, in those days of sober hope, that we had all gone beyond thinking that people could belong to only one thing.• Fintan O’Toole is an author and columnist for the Irish\u0026nbspTimes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3632dcdbdb339234088f1b26101f5bc4d33fea74/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4b7cf8af5bd0d82b67967a3e19dc5e89 1240w","title":"israel russia syria netanyahu iran middle east","story":"Clever wheezes in the Middle East have the tendency to not look very smart for very long. A case in point, as has become sharply evident this week, is the much-vaunted “deconfliction” arrangement between Russia and Israel after the former entered the war in Syria on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Negotiated between Vladimir Putin and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was held up at first as evidence of the latter’s diplomatic skills – an arrangement that allowed Israel a free hand against weapons transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and maintained Israeli deterrence on its northern border.Over seven years, the civil war has dragged in multiple foreign nations, turning what started as a pro-democracy uprising into a quagmire of overlapping conflicts.Global powerhouses including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States have all, to different extents, engaged their militaries in the conflict. At the same time, they have supported warring factions on the ground, including Iran-allied Hezbollah, Kurdish militia, and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance. Islamic State and al-Qaida are also present.If that arrangement has for long looked very shaky, the reaction of Russia and Iran to Israeli strikes this week on an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian advisers, has brutally exposed the assumptions that underlie it, not least Moscow’s tolerance for Israel’s assumption of its freedom of action.The reality is that Israel – and Netanyahu in particular – has badly misread the trajectory of Russia’s re-engagement in the Middle East, which has created in the very kindest interpretation the context for Iran’s projection of its influence ever further west and ever closer to Israel’s borders.Why all this matters in the current febrile context following the latest alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, is that Israel’s misjudgments sit at one corner of a dangerous matrix of unpredictability, perhaps unseen – as James Hohmann argued in the Washington Post – since the secretary of state Dean Acheson suggested in 1950 that Korea was outside the core defence perimeter of the US.On the American side that uncertainty around intentions has seen Donald Trump flip-flop so dramatically that in a handful of days he has somersaulted from suggesting first that his country was rushing for the exit on Syria to a situation where military strikes seem likely.In Israel, a wounded Netanyahu – who has built an entire political career on promising to be a bulwark against Iran – is now being confronted with his rhetoric and the consequence of his actions, not least his bloody public pricking of Iran in a way that Tehran may now find hard to discount.In the final corner there is Putin, whose calculations are opaque because that is his intention – not least over his ambitions and red lines.The result is a highly combustible situation in which no party to the conflict – direct or otherwise – can be certain of the assumptions that the others are operating under.All of which has created what Stephen Pinker describes in his illuminating book on violence and war, The Better Angels of Our Nature, as a classic “security” or “Hobbesian” dilemma, a situation where actions by a state ostensibly to heighten their security can prompt other states to act pre-emptively, risking a fugue of escalation. As more violence seems likely, what is also troubling is that the key mechanism for avoiding such an escalation – the UN security council – seems profoundly weakened by the further weaponisation of the US and Russian vetoes under both Trump and Putin.History teaches us that wars – from the first world war to Korea, the six-day war and the Falklands – are often fuelled by failures of messaging and interpretation.Looking around the Middle East today never has that felt more true. And never have wise heads been in such short supply.• Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab5e02b4913589399324d8bbe8070c3db914551/0_0_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c0b7972ac651ba2892b1b80f065f69d 1240w","title":"the guardian view on shoe box britain space is good for us lets have some","story":"So it is bizarre that the UK is one of the few western European nations to have no mandatory minimum space standards for housing. Little wonder that other nations have bigger homes while the UK gets shoe boxes. Ministers did introduce voluntary space standards for new homes in 2015, but as these could be ignored they only gave the appearance of solidity to pure wind. When this ruse was called out in 2016, the government said it would review how these were operating. Nothing has appeared. Part of this is to do with a rightwing legacy: Margaret Thatcher got rid of rules that set a reasonable internal size for public housing. Reintroducing legal standards in the interests of society is the right thing to do. It would also be a repudiation of a Thatcherite legacy, and is at odds with the direction of travel in housing.Houses are needed and the reasons are largely to do with social justice, inequality and the distribution of political power. There must be an acknowledgment of the psychological comforts that domesticity affords. Past rules would need to be updated – homes must no longer find space for dining tables and upright pianos but be designed for the activities and furniture that are typical today. The Grenfell Tower tragedy provided a new background for politicians to think about housing. For too long politicians have cultivated voters reliant on house prices remaining high, and rising. The policies that have allowed this have had a damaging impact on a growing proportion of the population. So far Theresa May’s government has exaggerated how far it is prepared to intervene on the side of this section of society. Setting mandatory standards for house sizes is one test of whether this rhetoric will yield to reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3280cfcd4e1cc0e3ca2b7e4cff42440db3d03ee/0_4_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=338a79fc30f115567d39f29dd1d06128 1240w","title":"love simon russell t davies and more on why the gay teen movie is a glorious victory","story":"With a lead whose sexuality isn’t a gimmick, this high-school drama may prove that film has caught up with its audience From his clean-cut good looks to his inner angst, the titular character in Love, Simon seems like your average American high school movie hero. Except for one thing: he’s secretly gay. The story of Simon’s journey out of the closet drives this sweet, funny and in many ways conventional teen comedy-drama that’s doing brisk business in the States.What’s more, Love, Simon is produced by 20th Century Fox, which makes it the first major studio teen movie with a gay hero. While arthouse and LGBT cinema have long explored the coming out story, queer characters have been minor players in films such as Mean Girls and Clueless. Indie comedies But I’m a Cheerleader (1999) and GBF (2014) put LGBT characters at the centre, but in the studio movie playground, the words gay and lesbian are insults spat out by prom queens and jocks. Occasionally, the butt of their joke is actually gay, such as Les in Bring It On (2000). But often this is directed at our straight hero or heroine, who must have a makeover and prove their heterosexuality in order to gain acceptance from both peers and audience. “When mainstream teen movies began to incorporate LGBT characters more regularly in the 1990s, they almost always came in the form of wisecracking cis men,” says Charlie Lyne, director of Beyond Clueless, a documentary on the 90s satirical teen comedy. “And even then, they were routinely sidelined and desexualised, as in the case of Damian from Mean Girls, who we’re told is ‘too gay to function’, but who never once expresses any attraction to other men. They’re often great characters in other ways but they’re deeply limited.”Based on the novel by Becky Albertalli, Love, Simon bucks many of these trends. Simon (Nick Robinson) is a well-rounded character whose sexuality is only part of his identity – and whose makeover is heading in a completely different direction. Also, he’s not alone in high school. Along with the jocks, nerds and cheerleaders, there’s one openly gay student, as well as at least two in the closet: Simon’s hesitant online flirtation with an anonymous pupil keeps the audience guessing.“The treatment of LGBT issues in teen cinema has definitely progressed in line with wider cultural attitudes,” Lyne adds. “If anything, teen movies have typically been a few years behind actual teenagers, who are usually among the earliest in society to sense a changing social tide. As recently as the early 00s, while queer teenagers built vast online communities at the very heart of mainstream platforms such as YouTube, teen movies continued to relegate LGBT characters to the sidelines.”Compared to cinema, television has been much quicker to catch up, notes Russell T Davies, who brought a gay teen to Channel 4 in Queer As Folk (1999). “The brilliant gay teen in My So-Called Life was 23 years ago,” he notes. Davies says that Love, Simon’s director has championed gay characters in many TV shows, from Dawson’s Creek to The Flash: “Greg Berlanti is a TV man through and through. He’s got acres of successful gay stories behind him. To see him bringing that into the multiplexes is a glorious victory.”So why has it taken film so long to catch up? The answer, says Davies, is simple. “It’s our old friend, that lumbering beast, the white, straight man. But it comes down to money in the end. Television can be more nimble because it’s cheaper: you’re looking at roughly $1m for an hour of drama. But if a movie costs, say, $30m, then there’s 30 times the caution, 30 more levels of bankers being scared, 30 times the arguments. Thirty more idiots, in the end. And if you increase the sums, if you go up to blockbusters costing $100m, then you have a hundred times the fear. That’s why a vast empire like the Marvel Cinematic Universe is devoid of gay characters. And that’s why Pixar has only managed the horrific camp of the Ken Doll in Toy Story 3.”The money men need only look to recent awards seasons to see that gay stories have wide appeal. Moonlight, God’s Own Country and Call Me By Your Name featured young gay characters who have become beloved by audiences beyond the LGBT demographic, winning Oscar-nominated Call My By Your Name star Timothée Chalamet a wealth of obsessive female fans. Combined with Love, Simon’s success, does this add up to a brighter future for high school movies with gay leads? Director Joe Stephenson (Chicken, McKellen: Playing the Part) isn’t sure. “Love, Simon is an anomaly in that it is receiving the support of a studio, and I’m sceptical about whether its success will trigger a wave of support from others on stories centred on gay characters. There remains a fear that a film centred on a gay character will be classed as a ‘gay film’, only of interest to gay people. People hoped a change would come with Brokeback Mountain but here we are 13 years later, asking if the change will come again.”Davies is similarly cautious. “I think we should be very careful if we imagine these changes are permanent. It’s been almost 20 years since Queer As Folk but still, every time I write a gay character, someone somewhere complains, and someone somewhere says, ‘This is new!’ It’s not one battle, it’s a constant fight.”And the fight isn’t just about representation, but narrative. Says Stephenson, “My hope is that gay characters can finally start existing in mainstream films without their sexuality being the key character trait. Straight people in mainstream films don’t have to deal with their sexuality constantly, neither does their sexuality have to be a ‘reveal’. How nice it would be for a character to be gay and it be of no consequence to the plot or their mental health at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a332f540ebad9c3aa03c7e80ac125f5ff71363a1/134_351_2968_1781/master/2968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e4175cfd93dfcf111108438e163858d6 1240w","title":"bosnia herzegovina england womens world cup qualifier match report","story":"Toni Duggan and Jodie Taylor brightened Phil Neville’s horizon by returning England to the top of their World Cup qualifying group as Bosnia’s initially obdurate defence came undone.A match featuring two sendings off – the first, involving Liverpool’s Alex Greenwood, was highly controversial – concluded with second-half goals lifting the Lionesses two points clear of Wales.For a while it had seemed as if England were about to take a wrong turn along the road to the 2019 finals in France. By the final whistle, though, Neville had secured the second victory of his five games in charge and was all smiles.“We talked about Bosnia parking the bus but this was parking three or four buses,” he said. “It was football like I had never seen before. It was a patient performance. We had to wait but the girls stuck at it. The first goal was always going to be key.”After playing in front of a 25,000-plus crowd at Southampton, where they were held 0-0 by Wales last Friday, the Lionesses were watched by a few hundred locals on a mountain fringed practice pitch in Zenica.Yet if the Bosnian football federation’s training centre was low on atmosphere and spectators, Samira Hurem’s side exhibited a fierce determination to frustrate their guests at every turn. England were required to deconstruct a deep-sitting, extremely conservative, physical, 4-5-1 formation with the early moment when Mel Lawley was sent sprawling following Milena Nikolic’s wince-inducing challenge proving thoroughly emblematic.Ranked 57th in the world, Hurem’s players were dominated by their opponents but nonetheless soon had England jettisoning sweet passing ideals in favour of a series of long diagonal balls.Envera Hasanbegovic, Bosnia’s goalkeeper, looked uncertain on crosses but, protected by that reassuring defensive blanket, was surprisingly underworked in a low-key first half.Its highlight was Hasanbegovic’s ersion of Jade Moore’s eye-catching, top-corner bound, 30-yard shot as the keeper demonstrated that shot stopping is her skill.If England could not be blamed for turning slightly direct against such bloody-minded opponents, they initially lacked sharpness and incision. Although Moore, especially, did some very good things in a holding midfield capacity, her team could have done with a few more crisp one- and two-touch passing moves.Watching Amira Spahic collect a booking for time-wasting after delaying taking a Bosnia throw it was easy to appreciate why.With his side largely restricted to long-range speculation, Neville’s problems intensified two minutes into the second half when, following a perceived e, Greenwood, already booked for dissent, received her second yellow card despite the left-back having a case for a penalty for what looked like a trip.As he consoled a tearful Greenwood, Neville must have been aware that this was the sort of game which his tactically intelligent predecessor Mark Sampson invariably found a way to win.The new manager’s mood visibly improved when the increasingly inventive Duggan – who is now at Barcelona – volleyed beyond Hasanbegovic after connecting with Lawley’s superb cross. “Toni scored a brilliant goal,” Neville said. “She was fantastic.”Shortly afterwards Spahic was dismissed for her second bookable offence, a tug on Beth Mead, the Arsenal forward having just replaced Lawley. Duggan’s 25-yard left-foot drive hit the woodwork, Hasanbegovic saved White’s volley and Mead’s excellent movement ruffled Bosnia’s backline.When the latter was felled by Lidija Kulis, England won a late penalty. Hasanbegovic ed the right way but could not deny Taylor – newly on for Duggan – her 17th goal in 37 internationals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a6ab4b434e1c5efc6cca274a312846ca0fb9b1/0_170_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=db1e6e0aab169a3f51cc262cea88cdec 1240w","title":"manchester city v liverpool champions league quarter final second leg live","story":"Liverpool are through to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.

City jacked it in after that, their hearts broken into a thousand tiny pieces. Liverpool were nervous as hell in the first half but they got the job done and have a serious chance of winning this competition.

As it happens I thought it was a foul on Van Dijk for the opener (but I guess I would say that wouldn’t I?)”I thought it was too, though obviously it was nowhere near as clear cut as the disallowed goal. It does go both ways: Pep Guardiola’s first Champions League victory came in no small part because that Norwegian referee turned down 12 clear penalties for Chelsea.89 min A Liverpool change. Danny Ings replaces the truly, madly, deeply magnificent Mo Salah.88 min “Only now able to catch up on tonight’s events,” says Matt Dony. “I’m fairly relieved that I didn’t sit through that first half. I’m rather attached to having fingernails. Still nervous (comes with the territory), but ever thankful for Salah. What a player. What a bargain!”The best thing about that goal was the calm awareness. While everyone else was skidding around all over the place, he looked like he was able to press the pause button and decide what to do before each touch. 86 min If Liverpool get Roma in the semi-finals...84 min “I am old enough,” says Arthur Tee, “to remember when Pep’s City was the best team we’d ever seen in the Premier League.”Arf.

Bit weird.Liverpool are through to the Champions League semi-finals! Otamendi makes his usual mistake, giving the ball straight to Firmino on the left wing. He dances into the area and passes the ball calmly into the net off the far post. Lovely finish.76 min Sane’s deep, lofted cross is headed wide from a prohibitive angle by Aguero.75 min If it stays like this, future generations will see a 4-1 aggregate score and assume it was comfortable for Liverpool.

That was another chance for Liverpool. City break and Van Dijk is booked for a perceived foul on Sterling. Not sure he did much wrong.63 min That Salah goal was such a savage plot twist that, for the time being, City’s heads have gone. Liverpool have had more promising attacks in the last 10 minutes than they did in the first 50.61 min City have been grieving for the last five minutes, running round without their usual purpose. De Bruyne tries to snap them out of it with a long-range shot that is easily saved by Karius.60 min The mood of the match has changed completely. Salah drives a brilliant long pass to Firmino, who gets the wrong side of Walker but dithers just long enough for Ederson to come out and claim the ball. That was a good chance. 58 min As you almost certainly know, Manchester City now need to score four goals to go through.That was such a cool finish. Mane surged into the area onto Salah’s pass and fell over after a challenge from Fernandinho. While everyone looked to see if a penalty would be given, Salah picked up the loose ball, danced around Ederson and dinked the ball gently over Otamendi on the line. That is just a sensational goal.The little genius has done it again!56 min A few of you have emailed to say that Ederson should have been sent off for repeatedly shoving Mane. He did act the goat, that’s undeniable, but I still think a yellow card was correct. Mind you, I haven’t read the Laws of the Game from cover to cover for at least a fortnight, so I’m a bit rusty.55 min Firmino, who has already been booked, gets away with a strong shoulder-to-shoulder challenge on the breaking De Bruyne. I think that was the right decision.

Roma struggle to clear. it bobbles around the box. Messi pounces on it and forces his way past two defenders and to within six yards of goal ... but he never quite has the ball under control, and Becker is able to rush out and intercept!Barcelona substitutions: Dembélé and Alcaer on, Busquets and Semedo off. Barcelona have five minutes plus stoppage time to score the goal that they have not looked like scoring at all so far.83 min: The Stadio Olimpico erupts as Manolas rushes to the home dugout, where he is engulfed by dozens of team-mates, staff and balls boys! Scenes! The greek defender sends a glancing six-yard header into the net from a corner! 82 min: If Barcelona succeed in hanging on here, everyone will want them in the semi-final, not least Liverpool, who would demolish them.Barcelona substitution: Gomes on, Iniesta off after exerting little influence amid the Roma whirlwind.79 min: Roma launch another counter-attack. Florenzi chops back on to his left foot and flights a dinky ball from the right beyond the far post. El Sharaawy stretches out a leg and turns it towards goal from three yards. Ter Stegen makes a superb reflex save to bat it away! A gasp goes around the ground!78 min: Barcelona have summoned some gumption at last and are zipping the ball around in a way that is irritating Roma, who just want to get it back so that they can tear forward anew.75 min: Ter Stegen kicks the ball downfield. Suarez and Jesus challenge for it. The defender’s arm brushes Suarez, who takes that as a cue to flop the grass and appeal for medical and referee intervention. The ref isn’t buying his act but Barça do, at least, get a breather. 74 min: Messi has a pop from the edge of the area. He gets good power on it despite minimal backlift. but Becker clasps it to his chest. Roma substitution: Under on, Schick off, no doubt knackered after a sterling performance. Just before that change took place, Suarez was booked for wasting time.71 min: Roma are channeling the spirit of the Metz team of 1984. I wonder, if Roma complete the job, which player will ask Messi where his ham is? (Read this to get that) 69 min: So close! De Rossi gets his head to a cross from the left ... but nods inches wide from six yards! 68 min: A Roma player lofts a hopeful ball into the box. Nainggolan gets to it first and, while leaning back, tries to sidefoot a volley into the net from 12 yards. It’s a decent effort but straight at the keeper. “If, and that is a huge if, Roma could pull off the win, can we call it ‘Romantada’?” quips RS Naveen. You sure can. And you might well get the chance to use it. I’d make Roma favourites at this point.66 min: Barcelona have a freekick near half-way. They try to run down the clock ...63 min: Messi pulls down Kolarov and is booked. That tells you all you need to know about how things are going. 62 min: The other three semi-finalists will be hoping Barcelona hang on here. Because, despite the scoreline, the evidence of the tie so far is that Roma would be more formidable opponents.59 min: The atmosphere in the Stadio Olimpico is absolutely intoxicating: the locals sense their team is on the verge of a historic comeback. And their players continue to bully Barça all over the pitch!De Rossi, who scored an own goal in the first leg, places a fine spotkick into the corner. One more goal and Roma will go through (provided they don’t concede). Barça are clinging on!Dzeko - brilliant all night - was pulled down by Pique after outmuscling the defender. The ref initially didn’t give it but, perhaps after advice from an assistant, eventually points to the spot. It’s the correct decision.56 min: Roma’s pressing pays off again! Strootman wins the ball in midfield and quickly fees Schick, who hurls himself to the ground. 55 min: Semedo runs into Kolarov as the pair chases a pass down the left wing. The ref gives Barcelona a freekick. A lucky break for the Catalans, and a chance for some respite.52 min: Rakitic fees a useful pass into the right-hand channel to relieve the pressure Sergi Roberto chases after it. But he’s eased out of the way by Manolas, who quickly gets another counter-attacking going. Barcelona are out of their depth in terms of physicality.51min: Furious pressing by Roma: they’ve got that head of steam up again. Barcelona can’t get out of their half!49 min: Dzeko ks an excellent pass to Florenzi wide on the right. The winger delivers a testing cross. Ter Stegen watches it floated over him. But no Roma player can reach it at the far post.47 min: It’s been a good start to the second half by Barcelona. They haven’t threatened but they’re kept the ball pretty well, denying Roma any chance to work up another head of steam.46 min: The teams are ready to go again, with the same players as in the first half. But will Barça have found extra energy? If not, they could be toppled. That was a very good half from Roma. Their only regret will be that they did not score more. But they have Barcelona rattled and the comeback is still a real possibility.45 min: Jesus booked for clumping into Messi from behind.45 min: Rakitic tries to release Messi with a neat ball from deep. but Manolas read it and gets to the ball before the Argentinian marvel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b9308dd831263eb396e4ae103c64d8b503b321/0_1070_4432_3225/master/4432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9e1e07af54d3c69f417c0b9ffe0350f 1240w","title":"nigel slater broccoli lentils and burrata recipe","story":"Chilli-spiked greens cooled by creamy Italian cheeseCook 80g of small dark green lentils, such as Le Puy, in deep, lightly salted boiling water for about 20 minutes or until tender but toothsome.

I sit on the floor of my family’s modest living room in a sleepy suburb in Ireland, my tongue contorting around my teeth in concentration as I apply a finishing layer of glitter to my masterpiece. It is my 14th year of life and also the 14th time in an hour that I’ve hit the replay button on my big sister’s CD player. A mere month before this scene, Lady Gaga had exploded out of obscurity – it is her image my younger self is reproducing in card and glitter, while Just Dance, released 10 years ago this week, loops in the background.In this moment, I already know that whatever is represented by this woman, this symbol, I love wholeheartedly. I know that she is the living embodiment of some ideal type that informs who I am. What I don’t yet know is that who I am is gay – and that my gayness will become inextricably intertwined over the course of my life with Gaga. She will become the background music in every gay club I will dance in, the overture to every drunken kiss, a talking point for every first date.Female pop icons have long formed a core part of gay culture, and much has been written about why. Some say we live vicariously through their sexuality more Freudian theories suggest they’re our surrogate mothers. Less controversially, one could simply say their bright pop ballads about overcoming love and loss have historically provided a light-hearted, strobe-lit, glittery escapism from a world darkened by the shadows of HIV and homophobia. Before Gaga there was Madonna, Cher, Diana Ross. You may think Gaga didn’t do anything over and above what these performers did: provide glamour and camp value. But the special place she carved in the hearts of gay people cannot be reduced to her penchant for changing wigs – Lady Gaga queered the mainstream.She emerged into a pop landscape staggeringly different to the one we inhabit in 2018. The pre-Gaga charts of 2007 were socially and politically sterile, thronged with such hetero banalities as Kaiser Chiefs and Timbaland. The closest we got to queer representation was the tasteless gay-baiting of Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl in 2008. We were at the zenith of an economic boom, unaware of the impending global economic catastrophe that would spark a period of political revolution to coincide with Gaga’s rise. Economic comfort meant that oppression was felt less keenly, that discourse was relaxed. For kids like me stagnating in small towns, in countries where gay marriage was still illegal and casual homophobia rife, the silence felt like the calm before the storm.Some would have disregarded the reactionary content of noughties charts and simply looked back to David Bowie, Prince and Boy George for revolutionary queer role models instead – they destabilised gender categories a decade before Gaga was born. But to my generation, these icons and their reassuring androgyny were out of reach. My childhood was an alienating cultural wasteland, where I survived on a diet of my parents’ Irish country music and my peers’ Top 40 pop. This was still the age of dial-up modems – for many pre-smartphone era queer kids, the likes of Bowie may as well not have existed.Consequently, Lady Gaga turned my world upside down. I suffered from chronic anxiety, linked to years of bullying. I was offensively effeminate and school was an ordeal spent avoiding older boys who spat “faggot” at me in the corridors. After Gaga exploded, I fashioned my own diamond-encrusted glasses and dyed my hair green – the slurs in the corridors lost their power when, like Gaga, I was deliberately provoking the attention. “What a freak,” my peers would scream at pictures of Gaga’s meat dress. I burned with defiance to hear them deride her – if she was a freak, this person I loved, then I didn’t want to be normal any more. The word “faggot” resounding in the corridor no longer marked me out as lesser, but placed me on a pedestal alongside my heroine, another freak – who happened to be No 1 in 20 countries. Her otherness made my own otherness feel more aspirational than painful. In a world of utter darkness, her presence was my only light, a wordless pathway to myself before I even knew what the word queer meant.Gaga did for my generation what Bowie did 20 years earlier. She re-queered a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity. She vocally defended the rights of LGBT people and spoke of her own bisexuality openly. In pop, she expanded what was palatable. She repopularised the flamboyant theatricality of outrageous costuming, on-stage bleeding and compulsive wig changes. She drew inspiration from Bowie’s lightning bolts, Alexander McQueen’s fashion, Leigh Bowery’s performance art, Prince’s androgyny. She performed in male drag, and forced us to question gender characteristics and human physicality with facial protrusions and prosthetic penises. She was the vanguard for a revival of queerness in pop culture that has left an astonishing legacy a decade later – one would hardly bat an eyelid now to hear a word such as “transgender” uttered in a chart-topping song, but before Born This Way the thought would have been startling. It is partly thanks to her that we now live in an era where RuPaul’s Drag Race is mainstream.In fact, Drag Race is perhaps the key to understanding what Gaga did for young queer people. When Gaga appeared as a host on the ninth series of the show, she entered posing as one of the contestants. It’s not insignificant that Gaga presented herself as a drag queen – that’s precisely what she has always been, and what she taught young queer people like me to be.Drag is about borrowing cultural references to construct a persona. When Gaga reinvented the revolutionary queer spirit of Bowie and Prince for the youth of the noughties, she was performing a drag of her own. She borrowed tropes to construct the persona that accrued her fame, figuratively lip-syncing along to the legacies of Cher, Madonna, and the stars she imitated. She invented Gaga in the same way that drag queens do their alter egos.Millions of young gay people in turn used her example to construct their own identities in small, alienating towns and villages around the world. Every person needs references to inform their social performance, to do a sort of drag in their daily lives. Gaga offered queer people those references that our heteronormative hometowns couldn’t, reaching back into the past and passing them forward to those of us who could not access them alone. She taught a new generation of young queer people how to drag up an identity out of a barrenness around them, by looking to history and pop culture. This is what gay people have always done – but many of my generation didn’t know how. Mine was a generation whose would-be mentors had been decimated by the HIV epidemic, causing a wealth of generational community knowledge to be lost forever a generation where cohesion in the real-world gay community was breaking down and gay spaces were closing.Gaga replaced my would-be mentors. When I mimicked her outrageous presentation, I was tapping into the references she offered to express a queerness that I was not yet able to put into words. Without her in the charts, many queer kids like me would have been left with no touchstones whatsoever. She taught us all to be drag queens in our own lives – as RuPaul says, “We’re all born naked, the rest is drag”. When Gaga came to host Drag Race 9, she was truly coming home. Her importance was summarised with beautiful simplicity when one of the contestants, Eureka, broke down, saying “you don’t realise what you do for people like us”.Ten years on, Gaga’s legacy is a changed world. For me, and many gay people around the globe, she is the icon of our generation, to whom we owe nothing less than our identities. Baby, there’s no other superstar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354e6722e5d64f06234e94fc5455a27a8a842f7/0_0_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?w=6000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1107848ad701d780d22d762227155593 12000w","title":"commonwealth uk brexit leaving eu","story":"As director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, I know what this institution does – and the notion that it can pick up the slack when the UK leaves the EU is nonsense. By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/894ef9391c7fd2b5f43e9144caf1e44a48ebf351/0_22_3500_2484/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=642b2c78f2b3e7920719f07445b0baba 1400w","title":"labour minister barry gardiner sorry good friday agreement shibboleth","story":"Barry Gardiner ‘fully supports’ party over six tests for judging exit deal, claims Corbyn’s officeLabour has said that the party’s international trade secretary spokesman, Barry Gardiner, “fully supports” the party’s Brexit policy, after it emerged that he had described one of Keir Starmer’s six tests for judging the final deal as “bollocks”.Shortly after Gardiner apologised for claiming the Good Friday agreement was a “shibboleth”, whose importance was being exaggerated, a fresh recording emerged of the same private meeting in Brussels.Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman, has repeatedly demanded that any deal achieves “the exact same benefits” as the current relationship with the European Union. It was one of six tests set a year ago, just before article 50 was triggered, setting the negotiations in progress.Gardiner is recorded ridiculing the proposal. “It’s bollocks. Always has been bollocks” – and goes on to dismiss the whole strategy of the six tests.“We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And it would have made sense, because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said that they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.’”He is also heard questioning the value of the “meaningful vote” on the deal that Labour MPs fought for, and saying, “any politician who tells you what’s going to happen … around that final deal is lying to you”.The comments were regarded by some in the shadow cabinet as a deliberate attempt to wreck Labour’s carefully negotiated position on Brexit.Starmer was furious, and complained to Jeremy Corbyn, having already raised objections to the “shibboleth” remarks. Corbyn later said his office had “had a conversation” with Gardiner.A spokesman said on Tuesday, “Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. Those include holding the government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.”Gardiner then pours scorn on the idea of holding a “meaningful vote” in parliament on the final deal – Labour’s proudest achievement during the passage of the bill.“You tell me what a meaningful vote is? Is a meaningful vote one where you have alternatives and you reject one and you opt for the other. If so, what are the alternatives? … What we’re going to have is, at best, clarity about the orce settlement.”The remarks underlined concerns about how the party will handle the vote, expected in the autumn, after the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, appeared to suggest the deal would be so vague Labour could back it.Gardiner suggested that if parliament voted against the deal, the most likely result would be the downfall of Theresa May, but even that would not resolve anything.“What is the new prime minister, the new leader of the Conservative party going to be able to do as a result of that parliamentary vote? Do they go back and try to renegotiate a different deal in Europe? Well there’s no time for that. Do they hold a general election?”Labour has not formally addressed the question of what should happen if the deal is unacceptable to the Commons.Corbyn sacked Owen Smith as shadow Northern Ireland secretary last month after he publicly broke with Labour’s policy to advocate a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Smith said, “Barry’s not talking bollocks when he says that Brexit cannot deliver the exact same benefits as we currently enioy. Of course it can’t. That’s why it’s so wrong for Labour to merely try and water down Brexit. It will make our country and our constituents worse off and it will jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland.”Earlier on Tuesday, as dignitaries gathered in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to mark the peace deal’s 20th anniversary, Gardiner apologised for remarks that emerged earlier, about the “shibboleth” of the Good Friday agreement, saying, “I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding.”He apologised in particular for the use of the word “shibboleth”, which he acknowledged “gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.”Corbyn was also forced to repeat his commitment to ensuring there was no hard border. “There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the Troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.”Marking the anniversary, Corbyn paid tribute to the architects of the agreement, which he called “a defining moment in Irish history, which allowed peace to prevail”.Labour MP Chris Leslie, who supports the Open Britain campaign against Brexit, said Gardiner had “trashed the central point of Keir Starmer’s Brexit policy – the pledge to vote against any final Brexit deal that didn’t offer ‘the exact same benefits’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ce3d261e4aa79df29658e0b3518ac6c97dc00b/108_308_4746_2847/master/4746.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0b628563168bfa706c347946099f3921 1240w","title":"caster semenya 1500m gold commonwealth games gold coast","story":"• Brittany McGowan: ‘It’s tough for a lot of women in the 1500m’• Isaac Makwala blitzes the field to win gold in men’s 400mCaster Semenya’s strongest opposition on the way to winning Commonwealth gold came from a faulty starter’s gun which left the women contesting the 1500m final struggling to stay warm on the start line.A deluge of rain before the race soaked the track at the Carrara Stadium and flooded the timing equipment. As organisers struggled to repair the clock and gun, the South African bounced on the spot in an effort to keep her muscles warm.The 1500m, the final event of the day’s athletics, eventually got under way 10 minutes behind schedule and Semenya was utterly dominant. She assumed a commanding position in the pack before executing her break with 300m to race, overtaking Kenya’s Beatrice Chepkoech, who finished second, with 150m left. Wales’s Melissa Courtney came third in 4min 03.44sec. Already double Olympic 800m champion, it is the first time Semenya has been to a Commonwealth Games and she performed a swan-like celebration after crossing the line in a Games record of 4:00.71.“As a middle-distance runner I have done enough for my collection but this is for me, country and for the youth, we are inspiring the youth, we just want to show them they can do it,” Semenya said. “It rained so it messed up the clocks so they had to make sure the clock was running. It wasn’t bad for me.”The 27-year-old will attempt to add the 800m title later this week but is running in the knowledge that a proposed change in rules concerning hyperandrogenic athletes may spell the end of her career.Semenya has hyperandrogenism, a medical condition most commonly affecting women that is characterised by heightened levels of male sex hormones, including testosterone. The IAAF, athletics’ world governing body, has stated it hopes to have revised rules in place by November which will restrict testosterone levels in female athletes. It could mean Semenya will face a decision on whether to take medication to inhibit her testosterone levels or stop competing at elite level.The Australian 800m runner Brittany McGowan added fuel to the debate around Semenya’s inclusion by suggesting her times and those of others competing in the same races as the South African should not be compared. “It’s a tough one,” McGowan said. “It’s tough for a lot of women in the 800m, 400m and 1500m at the moment to compare ourselves and be judged by our governing bodies on those times.”Scotland’s Eilish McColgan, coached by her mother Liz McColgan, who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990, could manage only sixth. “My mum said to me at 600, you need to be going. But the pace was so fast, I was already going,” she said. “I don’t know what more I could have done. I maybe waited too long because those girls are specialists and over the last 100 it takes me longer to get my legs going. I’m gutted because I was so close and it was there.”Isaac Makwala, the Botswana sprinter who kept the London world championships entertained last summer with a saga around his inclusion, won gold in the 400m. Makwala was barred from competing in the 400m final in London after complaining of an illness but later claimed he had been well enough to compete. The 31-year-old crossed the line in 44.35sec open-mouthed and arms spread in a crucifix position, finishing well clear of his compatriot Baboloki Thebe, who took silver in 45.09, and Jamaica’s Javon Francis in third.He claimed the Commonwealth title made up for the disappointment of not being allowed to compete in London. “I came here ready for this and everything has been going well since the world championships,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8813d562fb0761a4cd3a8522467584fe5b7d081/466_0_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=797013dc488a89a275659f39898ec14b 1240w","title":"commonwealth games england not doing so good largest team 5m","story":"Largest ever team to leave these shores is trailing Australia by a distance and the administrative backup has missed a trick tooTeam England ticked very few boxes at the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday, from the support officials who incomprehensibly botched the entry form for the cyclist Melissa Lowther to the athletes who became the latest high-profile names to fail to win medals.With 390 athletes and 198 support staff, the England party is the largest ever sent from home shores to a sporting event, comfortably eclipsing the Great Britain team which travelled to the 2016 Olympics. At a cost of £5m of taxpayers’ and national lottery money to cover a preparation camp in Brisbane, flights, kit and other expenses, it has not come cheap. As the established names, arguably those most likely to inspire the future generation, continued to fall by the wayside on Tuesday through injury or lack of performance, it became increasingly difficult to defend that sum.Tom Daley, one of a handful of household names here, announced he was withdrawing from the 10m platform inidual event because of a hip injury. By nightfall on Australia’s east coast the weather had turned grisly, thrashing rain soaking spectators at the Carrara Stadium and English athletes producing performances to match.Andrew Pozzi, a world champion with every opportunity to win, finished joint sixth in the 110m hurdles final, beating only one man. Ahead of him were Cyprus’s Milan Trajkovic, whose only senior titles are a pair of golds at the Games of the Small States of Europe, and the Australian bronze medallist Nicholas Hough, ranked 43rd in the world last year. “It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to see I should have been fighting for the medals,” Pozzi said. “I was in good enough shape to win a medal. These opportunities don’t come up often, so I have to wait another four years.”In the hammer the Olympic bronze medallist Sophie Hitchon conceded she might need to fine-tune a new technique she is experimenting with after three foul throws left her in last place. The 26-year-old had entered the contest as favourite, expected at the very least to improve on the Commonwealth bronze medal she won at Glasgow in 2014. Her capitulation encapsulated a miserable Games for England’s most well-known performers.There have been notable exceptions, particularly at the Aquatics Centre, where Ben Proud defended his 50m freestyle title, but even he was making amends for disqualification in the 50m butterfly, an event in which he was also reigning champion, earlier in the week. “When I lost the opportunity to retain my 50m fly title I really was clinging on to what I had left,” Proud said after winning in 21.35sec, half a second ahead of South Africa’s Bradley Tandy and Cameron McEvoy of Australia.Despite a slew of medals in the pool and at the gymnastics, where Nile Wilson has repeatedly performed, the gap to the home nation in the overall standings is growing. With 130 medals, including 50 golds, Australia are not going to be caught by England, who have 74, including 24 gold. “The tiny island nation of England are not doing so good,” cackled a DJ on a local radio station.The Brownlee brothers had set the tone in the triathlon on the opening morning of competition. Alistair, a double Olympic champion, trailed home in 10th while Jonny, who has claimed silver and bronze medals behind his sibling, was seventh. Both cited injury but neither seemed particularly cut by the defeat.Max Whitlock is Olympic champion on the floor but could finish only seventh, beaten by the Cypriot Marios Georgiou, a part-time dancer who goes by the name “street boy killer”. To his credit Whitlock fronted up after his defeat and said he was still getting used to a new routine but it did call into question how important the Commonwealth Games is to athletes who know there are bigger tests round the corner.The curse of the champions continued as Adam Peaty, fresh from winning the 100m breaststroke, was also defeated for the first time in four years in the 50m breaststroke at a Games which is showing little regard for bookmakers’ odds. Peaty reasoned that swimmers typically peak in the summer months, not in April when they would usually be in heavy training.The same is true in athletics but Adam Gemili, another name who withdrew with injury, said he felt the time of year is irrelevant. “We all knew it was going to be in April and had plenty of time to prepare for that,” he said. “It shouldn’t really be an excuse for anyone. It’s more just unfortunate circumstances and a bit of bad luck.”The chef de mission, Sarah Winckless, might have been tempted to implore the team’s big names to raise their game but she is occupying shaky ground when it comes to performance. The team’s leader was forced to apologise to the 21-year-old Lowther after she was unable to compete in the cycling because an official failed to tick a box on an entry form for the time trial.The extraordinary administrative error was not spotted until it was too late, despite “seven or eight” layers of checks when the mistake could have been identified. Despite the reputation of the Commonwealth Games as the “friendly games”, the organisers refused to bend the rules to allow her to race. It is understood she is devastated and her family, who were hoping to watch her on the TV from their home in Wakefield, are furious.Winckless, a world champion rower in 2005 and 2006, offered a personal apology to Lowther. “No athlete should suffer because of an administrative error by my group,” she said. “As soon as we knew of the error we did everything to rectify it and it went to the Commonwealth Games Federation re-allocation committee – unfortunately they were not minded to add her into the draw.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e84e70e20cfa198d5b02fa2348df3c456e2c71/9_78_2028_1216/master/2028.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8d9714429f0ef00ef4d6002da0e9cf34 1240w","title":"grand national aintree course heavy red marauder 2001","story":"The going on the Grand National course at Aintree was “heavy in places” on Tuesday evening after 8mm of rain fell at the track in 24 hours, raising the possibility the conditions on Saturday will be the most demanding since Red Marauder’s 33-1 success in 2001.“We were due a couple of millimetres on Monday night and a couple more early morning,” Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course, said. “But unfortunately we got a lot more than that. Hopefully it will dry a bit before Thursday and it looks like we’ve had most of the rain.“But having said that, temperatures haven’t really got up much. It feels more like autumn than spring, it’s significantly colder than yesterday and, if it had just gone up a couple of degrees with a bit of sunshine, that would have helped. But that’s Mother Nature for you.”The ground was close to unraceable 17 years ago, when the four finishers from 40 starters included two horses that had been remounted by their jockeys, a practice now banned. The race was the second to be run on heavy ground in a four-year period, following Earth Summit’s win in 1998 when six of 37 starters completed, including one that had been remounted.Only two Grand Nationals since 2001 have been run on going any slower than good-to-soft but with some rain in the forecast for Aintree on Thursday and Friday, the ground seems likely to be soft at best. As a result, the betting could change significantly as punters latch on to runners with low weights and proven form on heavy ground.The first major gamble of the week arrived on Tuesday, as Ross O’Sullivan’s mare Baie Des Iles was backed down to a top price of 20-1 having been available at 66-1 last week. Katie Walsh, O’Sullivan’s wife, will be in the grey’s saddle as she bids to become the first female jockey to win the National, and Baie Des Iles not only has form at extreme distances and on soft ground but is also set to carry only 10st 7lb this weekend.“Baie Des Iles could end up being our worst result,” Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill, said on Tuesday. “She will love the ground, is a grey and most importantly has Katie Walsh on board. It is a possible perfect storm.”Walsh is one of three female jockeys expected to line up for Saturday’s race, and Milansbar, the mount of Bryony Frost, is another soft-ground specialist that could attract support if the ground remains slow.“When he won at Warwick, Bryony had never sat on him before and she just gelled with him straight away,” Robert Bothway, Milansbar’s owner, said on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d93b01ce616caf9aebea0b211c555deee5526e/652_53_1317_790/master/1317.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e348a339f1bd1a6836a53f76a8479ea2 1240w","title":"worcester ben teo see out contract","story":"Te’o’s renewed commitment comes as a boost to Worcester, who can seal Premiership survival this weekend.

It was the actor’s first stage role, at the amateur Leith theatre in Edinburgh, the city where he was born. It was a funny start for a man who would go on to be known for the icy stare of his green-grey eyes.Back in 2008, he was in Michael Grandage’s Twelfth Night at Wyndham’s theatre, and on press night, he started to feel a serious case of nerves. “I knew Branagh was in the audience, and Judi … I was Orsino, so I opened the show with ‘if music be the food of love, play on.’” He starts to thump his chest. “My heart was giving it that,” he says, “and then I remembered about the pantomime cow. I thought, it’s all right, isn’t it?” He laughs. “It’s not a big deal, look …” If you can be the back end of a cow … “you can do anything”.I meet Bonnar over hasty supermarket sandwiches in his lunch break. He’s much more twinkly in the flesh than his famous TV baddies and bastards, from Line of Duty to Apple Tree Yard, would suggest. But he’s also adept at comedy, playing the acerbic and pathologically dry Chris in Catastrophe, as well as popping up in Psychoville and the rebooted Porridge. We’re at a rehearsal space in south London, where he’s finishing preparations for a new play at the Royal Court, Thomas Eccleshare’s Instructions for Correct Assembly. “It’s ostensibly about a man and a woman” – played by Jane Horrocks – “who have lost their son to a heroin overdose when he was 21,” he explains. “So they buy a new one, a flatpack son. A son they can construct. It’s about love and our relationship with technology, I suppose, and about parenting, and loss, obviously. All the big questions.”Almost immediately, he was cast as the philandering Duncan in BBC1’s Scottish take on scandi-noir, Shetland, a role that’s about to take him into its fifth series. “It’s a lovely thing to do,” he says. “And there were a few bits and bobs along the way, but Line of Duty was certainly a big break, if you like. It was the biggest part I’d played on telly, with the biggest profile.”Since then, he’s been on a roll, jumping from one quality TV show to the next, most recently in the grimly gripping Unforgotten, where he was a gay barrister who had been sexually abused as a child. He puts some of his success down to luck, or, as he puts it, “a chaotic miasma of circumstance that brings you to somebody’s door”. For example, when he played Eric Morecambe in BBC4’s Eric, Ernie and Me, he was lucky that his wife, the actor Lucy Gaskell, was from Wigan, and could help him with his north-west accent. “But it also helped when I woke up the morning of the audition saying, ‘I’m not going to do it. I can’t, it’s not me, I’m not right.’ She was going, ‘Don’t be stupid, get out of the door and go.’” He thinks it’s probably easier to be married to another actor, though he’s never been married to anyone else, he points out. “It’s a weird one, isn’t it, because sometimes you have to look deep into somebody’s eyes and tell them you love them and do it every night, or for millions of people to see on the telly. So yeah, I suppose it’s a bigger leap for those who don’t do it themselves, to imagine what the fuck you’re doing.” He laughs. “You have a shorthand: ‘God, I had to get my pants off today, it was really embarrassing.’ That’s all it would take, rather than, ‘You had to do what? Why? In front of how many people? 16?’”It was the simple fact that he loved Correct Assembly so much that brought Bonnar back to the stage, even though his TV career continues to go from strength to strength. While he acts in a dystopian play about rebuilding one’s dead child, he will appear on Channel 4 in another near-future role, the third series of Humans. He plays a government scientist – other details are secret, including whether he’s a goodie or a baddie. “I don’t know if I should tell you that. And anyway, I think it’s more complicated. He’s neither one nor t’other. But both, maybe,” he teases.Why does he think audiences are so fascinated with the future right now? “I was in my 20s in the 90s, when mobile phones were first around,” he says. “That wasn’t that long ago. It feels like the rate at which it is evolving is far outstripping the rate at which we are.” He mentions fake news, Trump and the Cambridge Analytica revelations. “That kind of thing is exactly why we should be questioning our relationship with technology and truth and memory, and all the exciting things that this play brings up, albeit in a very domestic setting. That’s why things like Black Mirror are such a huge hit, because people are, rightly, terrified about what this all means.” He left Facebook himself a year ago, he says, and hasn’t missed it.Bonnar will turn 50 in November. “It gets weirder, the older you get. You look in the mirror,” he says, with a dramatic sigh, “and go, Jesus Christ, it’s all going so fast. I certainly don’t feel 50.” It’s also his mum and dad’s 50th wedding anniversary this year, and their 70th birthdays, so they’re thinking about getting together for one massive party. “My dad went to art school when I was one. They scraped and continued scraping, because artists, as we all know, don’t earn a lot of money. It’s a precarious existence and my mum didn’t work, so dad sold paintings. He was town artist for a couple of places, in the glorious 70s, when a thing like that even existed. A town artist, wow.” There’s a knock on the door, and Bonnar’s lunch break is up. This is the last day before they move into the theatre, and time is tight. Before he goes, I ask if he ever takes offence at being known as such a good villain. “No, I don’t think so,” he grins. “I relish it in a way, because you get to do things you would never obviously do. It’s more interesting to e into those kinds of psyches.” And, he says, he’s got a good thousand-yard stare. “I do a good cold, hard stare,” he nods. Go on then. And he turns to me, and stares, and it’s so unnerving that I begin to squirm. “Yeah?” he says, refusing to drop it, for just a second too long. And then he starts to laugh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa45c454b91a053b1febb4ed4568d7042bd3c282/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=03cb79910752a1c02ad8685e2b4f35b5 1240w","title":"facebook notify users data harvested cambridge analytica","story":"People who fear their information may have been used by Cambridge Analytica can go to a new help pageFacebook has started the process of notifying the approximately 87 million users whose data was harvested by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Most users will see a message saying that “neither you nor your friends logged into ‘This Is Your Digital Life’”, the personality quiz that Cambridge Analytica used to gather its data.Around 87 million iniduals, including more than 1 million people in the UK, will receive a different response saying “a friend of yours did log in”.

But first, Zuck has a correction for the record: Cambridge Analytica was actually an advertiser in 2015, so Facebook could have banned them when they first learned of the data harvest, but did not. Zuck says that was a “mistake”.We’re on a short break. If you’re following along from home, here’s the bingo card I made yesterday. Senator Ted Cruz is focusing his questioning on whether or not Facebook is guilty of liberal bias against conservative content, a subject of much suspicion among Republicans since a 2016 Gizmodo report alleging that moderators were suppressing conservative news.Zuckerberg defended the platform’s political neutrality, despite the fact that its based in liberal Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg: “It was not because of a political view.” Senator Richard Blumenthal is pushing hard on Zuckerberg and Facebook’s statements that Aleksandr Kogan deceived the company when he harvested 50m users’ data. Blumenthal has a copy of the terms of service that Kogan used, and points out that they included commercial use of the data. “Facebook was on notice that he could sell that user information,” Blumenthal says. He says Facebook engaged in “willful blindness” and was “heedless and reckless”. He also asserts that the Terms of Service Kogan was able to user were a violation of Facebook’s FTC consent decree, which Zuckerberg denies.“We’ve seen the apology tours before. You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical violation to report this violation of the FTC consent decree,” Blumenthal says. “My reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road. Your business model is to maximize profit over privacy. I have no assurance that these kids of vague commitments are going to produce actions.” Senator John Cornyn brings up Facebook’s old motto of “move fast and break things”. “The broader mistakes we made were not taking a broad enough view of our responsibility,” Zuckerberg says. Cornyn asks pointedly about the old line that Facebook and the like are “neutral platforms”.Zuck replies: “I agree that we are responsible for the content.”Senator Dick Durbin began his questioning by probing at Zuckerberg’s own sense of his personal privacy.“Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?” Durbin asked.If you messaged someone last week, will you share that with us now? Durbin says that this gets to the core of the issue of privacy. Zuckerberg again raises the point that people “choose” to “share” information with Facebook, which obfuscates the fact that Facebook can infer what hotel you stayed in last night without you ever “sharing” that information in a specific post.“It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” Zuckerberg replies, to chuckles. Graham: “Why should we let you self-regulate?”Zuckerberg: “I think the real question is what is the right regulation?”Zuckerberg says that Facebook will provide Graham’s office with suggestions for good regulations. The number of topics under discussion in this hearing is a bit overwhelming, but everything always comes to back the 2016 presidential election and Russia. Here’s a clip of Zuckerberg stating that Facebook is working with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, though he is not entirely sure whether the company has received subpoenas.Senator Patrick Leahy presses Zuckerberg hard on its role in the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Myanmar, holding up a blowup image of a post calling for the death of a Muslim journalist. “That threat went straight through your detection, spread very quickly, and then it took attempt after attempt after attempt and the involvement of civil society groups” to get Facebook to take it down, Leahy said.“What’s happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy and we need to do more,” Zuckerberg began, but Leahy interrupted. “We all agree its terrible,” Leahy said, before calling on Facebook to do much more. Zuckerberg says the company is hiring “dozens” more Burmese language content reviewers, taking down accounts of “specific hate speakers”, and putting together a special product team that will produce some kind of “specific product changes” in Myanmar that he did not specify. One of the great things about this hearing is that Senators are asking very basic questions about how its service works. Senator Roger Wicker mentions that he’s heard that Facebook can track internet browsing even after someone has logged out of Facebook, and asks whether that’s true.Zuckerberg tried to deflect, suggesting that staff would follow up, but then was pushed to concede that Facebook does indeed track cookies. Senator Maria Cantwell’s line of questioning started with Palantir and wound its way to European data privacy law. Along the way, Cantwell got Zuckerberg to commit to finding out whether Facebook employees worked directly with Cambridge Analytica employees during the Trump campaign.Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, is offering a basic defense of Facebook’s business model, noting that nothing in life is free. He asks Zuckerberg what kind of regulations Facebook would support.Zuckerberg mentions that it’s important that data policies be understandable for people – which feels like a non sequitur – and warns that too much regulation on issues like facial recognition technology could result in America “falling behind” China and other countries. Feinstein is questioning Zuckerberg about election interference. Zuckberberg’s responses are largely hewing to previously released blogposts about the company’s plans for future elections and investigation of past elections. Why didn’t you ban Cambridge Analytica in 2015? Feinstein asks.Zuckerberg responds that Cambridge Analytica was not actually a Facebook advertiser at the time, so there was no way to ban it.Thune also asked about Facebook’s ability to manage hate speech. Zuckerberg discusses artificial intelligence and increased staffing for moderation. “There’s a higher error rate than I’m happy with,” he says. Thune begins his questioning by noting that Zuckerberg has been apologizing for the same problems for 14 years and asks why Facebook should be trusted now.“It’s pretty much impossible to start a company in your dorm room and grow it to our size without making mistakes,” Zuckerberg says.Zuckerberg also explains that the company is going through a “broader philosophical shift of how we view our responsibility”. For the first 12 years, Zuck says, Facebook thought that it was enough to just build tools. Now they’re reckoning with their “broader responsibility”, he says, using a key talking point for Facebook that we will likely hear over and over again in the coming days. “It’s not enough to just build tools, we need to make sure they’re used for good.” Senator Bill Nelson is questioning Facebook’s advertising model, and the use of personal information for targeting iniduals. He seems annoyed that Facebook would hypothetically charge users for an ad-free experience, but Zuckerberg points out that Facebook does not offer a paid version, and apparently has no plans to.Zuckerberg says the advertising model is “most aligned with our mission” because it allows the company to offer the service for free.

My younger son hasn’t started yet he’ll go in September. The older one is in year 1. Their mum is a trainee teacher, at a different primary school in the area. I have very little idea what goes on there, though. She is too exhausted when she gets home, physically and emotionally drained, and busy preparing for the next day, to talk about it much. Ask my boy what he has done at school that day and the reply is generally, “I can’t remember” or “Nothing much”.So this will be an interesting eye-opener for me, as well as for the people taking part. Blackrod primary school, outside Bolton in north-west England, has some new pupils. “Oh my God,” say the assembled children collectively when Class 6M comes in and turns out to be some of their parents, in school uniform. They’re here to find out what it’s like to go to primary school today.The kids and their parents in Blackrod are a bit different from the ones in our neighbourhood in Brent, north-west London. The Blackrock pupils are mainly white British and have English as a first language, even if it sounds different. The curriculum is the same, however, all about the three Ts: testing, testing and testing.And 6M aren’t being let off they’ll be doing Sats at the end of the process and are straight in with a maths test – bad news for legal secretary Julia, 47, who was never much good at maths. Soon her hand is up and she’s asking: “Can I go to the toilet?” I’d give her a sticker for the “to the” instead of just asking to go toilet but it’s soon clear it’s not about going toilet she’s gone for a cry. “I feel so stupid,” she sobs.“Don’t be daft,” says Mrs Mead, the teacher assigned to 6M. “This is part of the journey for us.”Mrs Mead is lovely, warm and strong. In fact, everything about Blackrod seems nice. The head has been there for more than 30 years, but he’s open to new ideas, as well as to letting the cameras in. “If you don’t take risks with anything, men would still be in a cave,” he says. Very true, Mr Flintstone … only messing, Mr Dryburgh. And he stresses the importance of music, drama and art.The grounds look lovely, there’s a horse in the field (not many of them where we are, and if there was, nobody would know what it was) and the sun is always shining – in Greater Manchester! I’d say Blackrod was an outstanding school and Ofsted agrees. (Obviously, being a parent in 2018, I can’t just look at a school and make up my own mind I have to look at the bloody Ofsted report). Would this programme maybe have been more interesting in a more challenging environment?Even the kids at Blackrod are pleasant, or else have been well trained for media. It’s not important to fit in, says one, you can just be yourself. They look out for each other, don’t even mind having their parents around.Apart from all the testing, primary school seems nicer now than it was, certainly for Julia. Turns out maths wasn’t the only issue for her. “I was scared to go to school,” she says. “Because I knew that my whole day would be hell.” There’s some of that going on, dredging up demons from the past it’s therapy, as well as finding out what her daughter Asha gets up to during the day.For Mark, 53, an engineer, the demons are PE demons. He didn’t like it then he doesn’t like it now. Nor does his son, Robert. Impending sports day is giving them the cold sweats, but they’re going to give it a go, for the team. Blackrod seems to me to be about right on competition as well – it doesn’t deny it, encourages it even, but winning isn’t everything there are points for taking part as well.Mark is good at maths he gets into the spirit of the place by helping Julia out. Rubbish at running, maybe, but he’s caring, patient and protective. Certainly protective of his two sons, both of whom are autistic.There’s always one to spoil everything – or to make it, from a television point of view. We have had the good news, the journeys, the tears. But every school drama – every school documentary, even – needs a bad boy, too.Stand up Jonny. A 36-year-old decorator, Jonny is soon sneaking off for a crafty cigarette, swearing, and he’s not happy about all the rules and regulations. “There’s less rules in prison,” he moans, and he may well know. Send him to Mr Dryburgh. Also required: a little extra English."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9508ac2b33c0651303a3491a1c2e7cc9d0d2d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=448defb9a1cf031fe89f2ca885e3b402 1240w","title":"saturday night live how the show has been exported around the world","story":"The long-running comedy series will receive a regionally specific version in Italy and it joins a long line of international takes on the classic formatHow do you say “more cowbell” in Italian? Last week, NBCUniversal signed a transatlantic deal with European media titan Sky to produce a regionally specific version of Saturday Night Live in Italy, expanding an already global network of sister shows. Though the past few years have seen the stateside SNL steep itself in the particulars of national politics more aggressively than ever before, the show’s format has proven malleable and lucrative in lands abroad.From Asia to Africa and beyond, the appeal of short-form scenes featuring celebrities and musical guests has struck a universal chord with viewers. This new Italian spinoff won’t even be the first to grace the country’s airwaves – an earlier effort titled Saturday Night Live From Milan ran for four seasons to roundly positive notices.In anticipation of the upcoming Sabato Notte Vivo (or whatever they end up deciding to call it), take a tour around the world with SNL’s international nephews and nieces, from Spain’s short-lived non-starter to the surreal celebrity cameos of Korea.Germany may not be known for its zany sense of humor, but during the better part of the 90s, RTL Samstag Nacht brought a dose of levity to the national television climate. However, the jokes were often dry to grim: the show’s breakout character was Karl Ranseier, an unlucky fellow whose increasingly improbable death scenarios would often be announced via a faux news report as an end-of-show gag. The Ranseier joke grew into a phenomenon all of its own, the German response to the proliferation of “that’s what she said” from the American remake of The Office.You can’t spell “Español” without SNL, and yet this explicit remake failed to gain a foothold in its market. That the show only lasted through a brief 12-episode run in 2009 could be attributed to several factors, most glaring among them the show’s title of Saturday Night Live, despite running during primetime on Thursdays. Moreover, audiences bristled at the lazy recycling of well-known sketches and dearth of original, culturally customized material. (The Spanish-language rework of the beloved Behind the Music bit does not pack the original’s comedic wallop.)South Korea has forged one of the strongest successes, a popular direct adaptation of the American program complete with Weekend Update and Digital Short segments. The similarities have their limits, however, and what lies beyond is can be wondrous and bizarre. Never is the difference in styles and tastes between the US and Korea more pronounced than when a Hollywood star with overseas appeal stops by. Model Miranda Kerr, MMA fighter Bob Sapp, part-time Asgardian trickster Tom Hiddleston, and most memorably, Korean favorite Chloe Grace Moretz have all made appearances to try their hand at phonetic pronunciation. One sketch, in which Moretz plays a young woman whose understanding of Korea is based entirely on soap operas, plays like a fever dream of unlikely cultural interchange.Saturday Night Live bil Arabi is recorded in Egypt – true to form, each program’s cold open concludes with an actor breaking the fourth wall to shout “From Cairo, it’s Saturday Night Live in Arabic!” – but caters to a massive area. Due to the erse array of cultures within its reach, this ranks as perhaps the most anodyne iteration of the program, keeping the humor steeped in the silly and safe from taboos. Nevertheless, the censors of Egypt’s media board suspended the program in February of this year due to accusations of “sexual implications” in the writing. A rich, detailed history of Japanese comedy made the nation a natural home for another SNL in 2011, drawing on the traditional konto style of slapstick rather than high-concept character-driven sketches. While the theme sequence uses identical music and the usual oh-I-didn’t-see-you-there cast introductions from the US version (along with the usual guest hostmusical break format, including the Weekend Update segment), the content itself would be somewhat unfamiliar to the western humor palate. Konto works in shorter bursts, and bears a strong resemblance to standup as opposed to sketch comedy.In France, the Big Mac is le Big Mac, and Saturday Night Live is Le Saturday Night Live. This spinoff has only been on the air for a little over a year, but has already made itself known to American audiences. Crossover comedian Gad Elmaleh hosted the series’ pilot episode and recently stopped by Conan O’Brien’s show to dish about his experiences, which included yet another parody of the “more cowbell!” sketch. Truly, nothing bridges the cultural gap quite like a paunchy man pelvic thrusting while banging on a cowbell at an ear-splitting volume. (Also in French: SNL Québec, a spinoff for Lorne Michaels’ compatriots.)Nothing like a little laughter to warm up the forbidding cold of Scandinavia, and in 2016, this program tried to bring some heat to the Finnish comedy world. With an odd lineup of stars to host – A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master director Renny Harlin graced the show in 2016, this time in front of the camera — and a reliance on bits purloined wholesale from the American original, it lasted all of one season. (Brazil produced another one-season wonder back in 2012, similarly failing to gain a foothold due to an inability to develop its own identity.)SNL Polska has been going strong since late 2017, bringing the energy of Warsaw – the New York City of Poland! – to a close adaptation of the original. Check the boxes: Weekend Update (complete with Drunk Uncle), political satire goofing on the prime minister, even the pop-culture parodies that mostly serve as an occasion for the cast to go around the horn with recognizable impressions. They even did the Star Wars Auditions sketch!

A monument in Belgrade to the first person in space did not last much longer, being swiftly dismantled after causing online hilarity owing to its curiously small head. On Sunday, a number of Serbian websites noticed that a monument to the cosmonaut had appeared on a street in the Serbian capital that beared his name. The large plinth and the small bust of Gagarin’s head prompted the website Noizz to quip: “The only way you can see it clearly is to launch yourself into the sky.”The monument’s unfortunate proportions prompted a barrage of online sarcasm and inspired an array of parodies, including the following tweet.The official unveiling was to take place on Thursday, Serbian media reported, but on Tuesday the monument was dismantled. A video published online showed a man climbing up a ladder and unceremoniously wrenching the undersized head from its plinth. Goran Vesic, a city official, said a new monument would be commissioned and would be vetted by all relevant institutions before installation. “Gagarin will have a memorial in Belgrade worthy of the contribution that he has made to humanity,” he said in a statement reported by the wesbite B92.net.There are dozens of monuments to Gagarin across the former Soviet Union. A town in western Russia close to his birthplace was renamed Gagarin in 1968 after the cosmonaut’s death in a plane crash.

Foreign buyers have flocked into Berlin’s residential and commercial property market, with the US investor Warren Buffet agreeing a deal last month to acquire a top-end real estate agent in the city that sells apartments for as much as €3.8m (£3.3m). The boom has been fuelled by cheap borrowing and a fast growing population. The city’s population has grown by about 50,000 a year over the past five years to 3.5 million. It is projected to reach 4 million by 2035. On immowelt.de, a popular German property website, apartments in NeuKölln, which is regarded as one of the hippest neighbourhoods, can be found €175,000 and are marked by the agents as “Ihr cleveres investment”.

And this goes on today. We need to do better.”The church needed to “love people as God made them”, he said. “That will have implications for our policies and stances as churches. If we are to do better, we need to change.”There had been “other times in the history of communities of faith when people have found it difficult to accept change, and sometimes difficult to see God’s hand in it”, Bayes said.“A classic example is the struggle for the abolition of slavery, and the ceaseless advocacy that was needed on the part of Christians to persuade their friends that God’s love for all human beings had social consequences which demanded justice.”The Ozanne Foundation, which Bayes is chairing, would advocate courteously but “consistently and without apology” for change in C of E policy and culture, he said. “It’s work which demands patience, but which also calls for a holy impatience … While we are talking, people are suffering.”Bayes is the most senior member of the C of E hierarchy to press publicly for far-reaching change in the church’s attitudes to LGBT people and a meaningful welcome to Christians in same-sex relationships.As a senior bishop associated with the church’s evangelical wing, he has previously acknowledged that he has been “profoundly changed” by encounters with lesbian and gay Christians, including within his own family.The C of E is moving “glacially slowly” on changing its attitudes, he said.The church has been wrestling with attitudes to gay clergy and congregants in same-sex relationships for at least two decades, but campaigners for LGBT equality believe the current of opinion is in their favour.Although the church still formally adheres to traditional biblical teaching that marriage can only be a union between a man and a woman, in practice many churches offer informal blessings to gay couples who have gone through civil wedding ceremonies.The Ozanne Foundation is named after Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for equality within the church. Its three-pronged strategy is to “encounter, educate and empower”, and it will work with organisations around the world to advocate for equality and ersity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f881d3c8ee5b507c5ac56e3da1a1f366c351e922/0_33_750_450/master/750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c3b03d181fe238134cbf9483931a75f 1240w","title":"europes longest heated cycle path to connect dutch cities","story":"1.7km Wageningen to Arnhem link set to be kept snow-free by energy from local paper plantThe longest heated cycle path in western Europe, and possibly the world, is set to be built in a Dutch beauty spot to cut the commuting time between two of the country’s cities all year round.The new 1.7km “cycle highway”, which forms part of the route linking Wageningen and Arnhem in the east of the Netherlands, will be kept warm by residual heat from a local paper plant.Concerns have been raised that frogs might find the warm path a little too comfortable, putting them and cyclists in danger. But Gelderland council has promised to monitor the impact on the local wildlife, which includes many water birds and beavers.Towns across the Netherlands have been investing in heating stretches of cycle paths, but nothing on the scale proposed in Gelderland has been constructed.Cutting through the Jufferswaard, a nature reserve near the Nederrijn in Renkum, the two-way cycle path is also likely to be one of the most idyllic, and is due to be completed in time for the winter of 2019. De Jufferswaard, a nature area of 31 hectares (77 acres), is located in the floodplain along the Nederrijn river, between the factory site of the paper mill Parenco, one of the area’s biggest employers, and the Rhine bridge at Heteren village, 7.5 miles (12km) south-west of Arnhem.Petra Borsboom, a spokeswoman for Gelderland council, said they believed the path would be the longest of its type in western Europe. “We don’t want to make the claim that it is the longest in the world because there might be one in China we don’t know about,” she said.The cycle route will shorten the riding distance between Wageningen and Arnhem by 600 metres. The biggest gain of the route would be “time, safety and experience”, the council said.She added: “This path is mainly for commuters. It is a beautiful protected area and that is the reason we wanted to do this. We don’t want to use salt there to keep it snow-free.“There was a lot of fear that frogs in the road would want to stay there but we will follow the impact on the smaller animals very closely.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29e237198369ca27e016f09700828b2ad8d06ba/0_15_1486_891/master/1486.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=44fb2a22fd7e97914db6a39c52118f65 1240w","title":"it took me years to accept it would work readers on the good friday agreement","story":"For the 20th anniversary of the agreement we asked people to share their memories from the time and to tell us how they feel nowAlthough I was only seven at the time, I have a vivid memory of it being one of the first times when I took an interest in watching news as opposed to wanting to play outside. My mother sat down with me and proclaimed that it was the most important decision that would bring about peace for my generation and that for once we would all be equal. I remember watching both our local and the national TV coverage as I was so engrossed in the story of people putting aside differences and working towards peace. The peace process is a shining example of the good that politics and democracy can bring. It makes me proud to say that I’m from Northern Ireland due to its legacy and how that can inspire other nations also experiencing internal conflicts.Brexit poses a grave risk to the positives of the Good Friday agreement. Although I grew up in a RepublicanNationalist household I would have self-identified as a Unionist, as I felt Northern Ireland was better off as part of the UK and the EU. After the EU referendum results, my ideological views completely shifted and I wanted a united Ireland instead. I travel on the Enterprise train from Belfast to Dublin. Will a hard border force us to stop for a customs search? My boyfriend lives in Dublin and the thought that there will be added unnecessary delays when we come to be together feels so foreign and illogical to comprehend. To disregard the Good Friday agreement and its importance is to disregard the unique and special relationship Northern Ireland has with the Republic of Ireland. In doing so, Brexit risks not only the agreement but also the very nature of the United Kingdom.I grew up in suburban Dublin and my parents were from border areas (one north, one south). We visited my grandparents north of the border on a regular basis and spent a lot of time with my cousins, aunts and uncles there. It didn’t matter to me that helicopters flew overhead every day or that there were armed soldiers patrolling the streets of the quiet countryside town.  In 1992 I turned seven. My sister and I were staying with our grandparents for a few days and I was let out on my bike as long as I didn’t cross any roads. Around one corner there was a soldier holding a rifle. I was probably only a few metres past him when a huge bang went off. I was terrified and raced down the road and hit straight into my grandparents’ door. I found out later that the soldier was shot by a sniper.  Six years later and with the Good Friday agreement the lookout towers started to be dismantled and there were barely any street patrols. People were happier and free to come and go as they pleased, play sports, walk the hills and enjoy the magnificent countryside. Life was better. It got rid of the bad from both sides and I want neither to return, nor do I want anybody to relive what I’ve experienced - but I want them to remember.On the day of the agreement I remember my parents watching in the afternoon on the small TV in the living room and telling me to watch it as it was history in the making. I wasn’t really that interested though. It was lovely and sunny and the first day of the Easter holidays so I took my younger sister up to a building site to explore instead! In the run up to the election however I was engrossed. I asked my father why all these yes and no signs were up everywhere and he explained the terms of the agreement. I read the booklet and remember saying quite clearly that I would vote yes.I’m very disappointed in the current state of affairs in Northern Ireland. The political parties seem more concerned about getting one over each other rather than focusing on changing issues that affect us all, such as the economy. I really hope Brexit has as little effect as possible as a hard border would be a nightmare situation. If the UK economy slows as a result Northern Ireland will be hit the worst.My employers in Dublin gave me the day off to travel north to vote. I cried for most of the journey as I remembered the last time we dared to hope. I had grudgingly accepted failure and chaos, not due to the people of the island of Ireland - whether they were green or orange, but the history of Britain’s politics in Ireland did not stand up well to scrutiny. After the results were announced I still expected to be disappointed it took me years to fully accept it could work. But no matter what we think of modern day politicians they stood tall. Some thought it a victory whereas I thought it was a wasted life and 30 years. We had just been permitted to compete but had yet to start running. I had fully accepted that I wouldn’t live to reap the true rewards nor perhaps would my 10-year-old son. It will be a long slow road but at least there is a road. However Brexit will be nothing but negative for all concerned.I am embarrassed to say that I voted against the Good Friday agreement. At the time, I felt that the prisoner release scheme was a step too far and that it was difficult for people to forgive the violence and death that was part of the Troubles for so many years. I was 18 and I had always lived in Belfast and I think I found it difficult to see the broader picture. Within a very short time I was able to see the value of it ending violence and enabling politicians to engage with each other across the sectarian ide. I feel that all the politicians involved worked hard to secure the agreement and, despite some terrible atrocities in the weeks and months after, it has been successful in ending violence. I am happy that my children can now enjoy their lives without the knowledge or the threat of paramilitary violence. There continues to be ision and political uncertainty in Northern Ireland and the peace process is still very much a ‘process’, however the achievements of the Good Friday agreement mean that, eventually, we will have a stable and more progressive country. I was nearly 12, and remember the vote no graffiti going up in various places along the way from Belfast to Armagh. I was quite apathetic to the whole thing. Thankfully the Good Friday agreement seemed to have a pretty decent impact, especially after the Omagh bombing. Industry in Northern Ireland is now on the wane, and the political vacuum that exists now is really worrying. It’s really sad that the schools and residential areas are still segregated and I genuinely believe that no real difference can be made unless children realise from the earliest possible age that their neighbours from a different religion are just as benign and boring as they are. It looks as if Brexit will be wholly negative and that is because the political powers have been largely irresponsible to date. The role of Northern Ireland has straddled the odd position of being completely ignored by one side (UK) and being used as a pawn to benefit a party and leader’s status in another jurisdiction (RoI and EU negotiations). I wouldn’t be very optimistic if the changes heralded by Brexit are as drastic as some Tories and others are pushing for.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesUK Labour politician Barry Gardiner has insisted he “absolutely” does not believe the Good Friday Agreement is outdated and said he was “deeply sorry” that remarks he made about the deal had led to a “misunderstanding”.Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that the Irish Government was playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said:“I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there”.In a statement released on Tuesday, Mr Gardiner apologised for the remarks, saying: “The Good Friday Agreement is a vital and essential part of the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and has been central to the two decades of peace it has brought about.“Labour is completely committed to the agreement and opposed to any return of a hard border between North and South.“We are committed to negotiating a new customs union between the UK and Ireland as part of a final Brexit settlement, which would play a key role in ensuring there is no hard border.“I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point — in particular, that my use of the word ‘shibboleth’ in its sense of ‘pass word’ or ‘test of membership’ gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant.

But I trained as a journo, so no sale on that.”Current Catalan secessionists - as well as some on the Spanish Left - accuse the conservative government in Madrid of revealing its true authoritarian and Francoist nature with its crackdown on the independence movement, while critics claim the spectre of the dictator is being exploited to stir nationalist sentiment in the autonomous community.Simon angrily denied suggestions that that he could be used for anti-Spanish propaganda.“If you think it matters who funds my storytelling, please tell some Spanish nationalists to put up half the money. Their political influence on the narrative will carry as much relevance. Or lack thereof,” he said. Mr Roures has always rejected claims his views influence the work of Mediapro, which has produced Woody Allen films including Midnight in Paris and Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Comment: An 80 year-old trapped in hospital loses body mass equivalent to 10 years of ageing.

Outrageous. One expects a president, one gets a sub-priest,\u0026quot Mr Melenchon said in a tweet.\u0026quotSecularism is the jewel in our crown. That is what a president of the republic should be defending,\u0026quot new Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure said in a tweet.Regarding his call for Catholics to get involved in political debate, former family and women’s rights minister Laurence Rossignol, responded with sarcasm that they were “already very politically involved”.Catholics were, she wrote, “against condoms, emergency contraception, IVF, assisted reproductive technology, the right to die with dignity...”The Macron camp said that there was no suggestion the president was tampering with secularism if you read the speech in its entirety.At one point, the president said: “My role is to ensure that the citizen has the absolute freedom to believe or not believe but I ask him in the same way to absolutely respect without any compromise, the laws of the French republic.”Interior minister Gérard Collomb, in charge of government relations with religious groups, said there was no cause for controversy.\u0026quotWhat he is saying is that for human beings, there is not only the material world but also the search for absolute values, for spirituality, to find meaning in life,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotIt is perhaps a new tone but in no way does it break with the great tradition of secularism.\u0026quotComment: An 80 year-old trapped in hospital loses body mass equivalent to 10 years of ageing.

However, it turned out to be a determined seal, which swam 50 miles through Britain’s river network from the North Sea in pursuit of fish.The long-distance swimmer had most likely become lost and disorientated after chasing a salmon or sea trout upstream, according to experts.The seal is thought to have swum through York on its way to the Dales, in pursuit of fresh Spring salmon.Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Anthony Hurd, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Living Seas Centre Manager in Flamborough, said it is not rare for seals to travel upstream in search of food, but that it is “surprising” the animal was spotted so far inland. It is thought by the Trust that the animal became lost while on its journey to catch fish.Bex Lynam, The Trust’s North Sea Marine Advocacy Officer, told The Telegraph: “Seals are known to use a number of the UK’s rivers and on occasions will swim upriver for quite some distance. “It’s thought that they are simply following their food source which would include salmon or sea trout making their way up the river at particular times of the year. “They may then become disorientated, especially younger seals, which is why they have been reported found in fields and similar unusual locations, having hauled themselves out of the river and on to dry land.”Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Walkers were stunned to see the large grey male seal near Thirsk, at a spot near Topcliffe Weir.He was pictured by amateur photographer Karen Hargreave, from the area, who said she had never seen anything like it before.She said: \u0026quotSome friends of ours went for a walk, and saw something large in the river. \u0026quotOn closer inspection they realised it was a seal and as I am interested in wildlife they messaged me. \u0026quotApparently the seal had turned up last Thursday morning. Locals from the mill spoke to various experts, some I think may have visited the site, and confirmed it was a large healthy male. \u0026quotHe had probably swum up from the Humber estuary following salmon. \u0026quotWhen I saw the message, I rang my friend as I couldn\u0027t quite believe it. She confirmed the sighting .but also said that it had since disappeared. \u0026quotMy husband and I decided to try our luck on Friday morning, and sure enough he was still there,  out on the bank. He was an amazing sight.\u0026quotThe seal was seen swimming in a wierHe was also spotted by walker Tony Wilson, 48, who thought the animal was a sheep.Mr Wilson said: \u0026quotIt looked so bizarre. At first I thought it was a sheep but as I got closer I saw he was a great big grey seal. I couldn\u0027t figure out how he\u0027d arrived there but speaking to people in the village later it seems he\u0027d swam all the way from the sea up the river.\u0026quotSea life experts were impressed by the \u0026quotincredible\u0026quot journey the seal made. Head Curator at Sea Life Manchester, Alan Kwan told The Telegraph: \u0026quotIt\u0027s true what they say, there\u0027s no such thing as a free dinner, even in the animal world! It\u0027s likely the seal hankered after a particularly dishy fish - so much so that the seal gave chase for 50 miles! Seals are incredible animals, the transition from sea to freshwater wouldn\u0027t have bothered him at all.\u0026quot Comment: An 80 year-old trapped in hospital loses body mass equivalent to 10 years of ageing.
