Most us fast through the night – that’s why our first meal is called break-fast. Intermittent fasting tends to extend the period of time that we’re not eating to upwards of 12 hours.Some people go for 14 hours between eating, others go longer. And some people do it every day while others use it as a kind of weekly reset. An old friend of my mum’s, for example, spent 30 years never eating on a Monday. He’d have his last meal on Sunday evening and his next on Tuesday morning.For the most part, it involves dining earlier and breakfasting later. You set aside an eight-hour window in which you can eat what you want (within reason), or to reach your daily calorie intake, and then that’s it. You might have breakfast at 10am, your lunch at 1pm and your dinner at 6pm – and then not eat anything else untli 10am the next day.If you’re eating relatively healthy balanced meals, you should find that during those eight hours, you don’t really get hungry. Most of us snack for about 14 hours a day – and we wonder we’re not seeing the returns we should be from our exercise regimes. This concept allows you to snack within limits.Liam, 34, is a PT who has been intermittently fasting for the past year. In periods when he wasn’t working, he often went for up to 32 hours without a meal – eating only after smashing out weights in the gym today, he only fasts four days a week – although the fasting window is about 23 hours.‘I fast from 8pm the night before until about 5 or 6pm but I don’t fast on gym days,’ he tells .A low-effort way of making gains and maintaining weight (Picture: Ella Byworth for )His fasting days tend to amount to 1,400 calories and he ups that to around 2,800 calories on normal eating days. He claims to have made significant progress in his training and says that fasting allows him to concentrate on other things.‘If I know I’m not going to be eating, I don’t have to spend time shoppingcookingeating,’ he explains.‘I just get on with other stuff – going out or working. It makes you way more efficient with your time and I find it much easier to concentrate on a more empty stomach.’Now that sounds fair enough if you’re one of the lucky people who eat to live, rather than lives to eat. For many of us, however, food is something we love and look forward to – it’s the reason we train hard. So that’s when the 16:8 rule comes in – sticking to that eight-hour window and prioritising when you want to eat means that you can benefit from fasting without really denying yourself. As long as you try to eat healthily for most of the time, you should be able to have your cake and eat it.It’s supposed to be an easy and effective way of getting lean without having to go on a diet. You’re not restricting calories, you’re not embarking on any stupid fat-free, carb-free, sugar-free plan. You’re eating normally, just in a shorter period of time. And because you’er not depriving your body of nutritents, it’s supposed to be a really good way of maintaining muscle mass while getting lean (which is oten hard to balance).Like most things, it might seem like a new wellness fad but intermittent fasting has been around for centuries (Pythagoras was a fan).Remember the 5:2 diet (eating 500 calories twice a week and your normal calorie allowance five days week)? That was a type of intermittent fasting. But this timed approach sounds both easier and less miserable than its predecessor.Intermittent fasting is supposed to help make the body more efficient in how it burns and uses fuel, rather than forcing it to lose weight.When you eat a meal, your body spends a few hours processing the food, taking and absorbing nutrients and working out what it can use. Because of all the readily available fuel you’ve provided it with, your body will choose to burn food as energy, rather than stored fat. And that’s epceially true when you eat carbohydrates and sugars they’re readily available and easy to turn into glycogen.If you struggle with snacking, this might help (Picture: Ella Byworth for )Turning fat into fuel (ketosis) takes a little more effort and means that you’re forcing the body to become more efficient in fat burning the result (if you don’t go overboard in what you choose to eat) should be a reduction in body fat and a maintenance (and perhaps even an increase) in lean muscle.It takes up to about five hours for the body to finish absorbing and digesting and after that period, your body goes into a ‘post-absorptive state’, which lasts up to 12 hours after your meal. That’s when you enter a fasted state – and it’s then that your body finds it easier to burn fat because your insuline levels are low.Most of us never really reach that fasted state. Our culture has increasingly become one of eating regularly so we never really get hungry and we never really recover from digesting and aborbing. Perhaps that’s one of the reasons so many of us struggle with poor gut health – we never give our digestive systems a break.Aside from the benefits, intermittent fasters often claim that their lives are simplier as a result of following suhc a pattern. Wake up, grab a glass of water or coffee and you’re good to go until mid morning or lunchtime. There’s less cooking, less planning and as a result, more time to do other stuff.Back in 1946, scientists discovered that intermittent fasting extended the life of mice. More recently, Harvard researchers concluded that fasting can aincrease life, slow aging and improve overall health by altering hte activity of our cells.They found that fasting can manipulate our mitochondrial networks (they’re the tiny power plants inside our cells) to keep them in a youthful state. Our networks tend to alternate between being fused and fragmented the Harvardstudy found that fasting can promote homeostatis (being in a regular state) in these networks, allowing for a healthy plasticity between the fused and fragmented states.Senior author on the study, William Mair, said: ‘Our work shows how crucial the plasticity of mitochondria networks is for the benefits of fasting,’ the study said.‘If we lock mitochondria in one state, we completely block the effects of fasting or dietary restriction on longevity.’Of course, longevity is down to a whole host of factors, but anything’s worth a shot.‘Going without food for 14 hours can help as in the longer term it may help the way that cells respond to glucose and insulin, and also help lower blood pressure,’ Nutrition consultant and founder of #nutribollocks, Ian Marber, tells .If you have disordered eating or think you might struggle mentally with any form of restrictive eating, you may want to give intermittent fasting a pass.There’s also your social life to think of. If you tend to socialise around food, think about how you’ll navigate those events. Perhaps you only want to fast a couple of days a week when you know that you won’t have any supper parties or events to go to. Perhaps it’s a case of revolutionising how you socialise – swapping meals for activities, for example.Set your hoursIt’s no good deciding that you’re going to go for 23 hours in between each feed if you’ve never done it before. Start small and see how you get on.A good place to start would be to stop eating at 8pm and resume eating at 10am (giving you a 10 hour eating period) and then scale that back to 7pm and 11am (that golden eight-hour window). And if you want to eat a little more during the window, then go back even further and miss morning munch altogether and eat between noon and 7pm.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Decide on your calorie intake and your cheat daysSo unlike the dreaded 5:2, this kind of fasting works on the principal that you keep your calories basically the same. For most of us, we’d probably be looking to stick with our maintenance calories – but if calorie counting isn’t for you, just eat as you normally would.To ensure that you actually stick with it, plan a day when you’re going to eat what and when you want to. It might be every Saturday (who’d want to miss out on brunch?), or it could be all weekend. Whenever it is, use that as your time for having late dinners and early breakfasts.Work out what you want to get out of itIs it just that you want to streamline your life, or do you want to lose body fat without obsessing over calories and scales? Whatever it is, concentrate on that and you should be able to make it through those sneaky 9pm munchies.Anyone fancy a Branston Pickle doughnut for National Doughnut Week?Ramadan 2018: Best places in London to go to for Iftar and break your fastIf you tend to get home from work late, think about meal prepping. Rather than taking your breakfast into work, how about taking in your dinner instead? That way you’re not rushing home to cook and eat in your assigned window.Where does your exercise fit in?Since fasting, Liam tells us that he’s has reduced the number of days he spends in the gym and that’s not uncommon. People often report that they find themselves needing to work out for less time to see the same results. Fasted cardio is supposed to be the thing for fat loss so if that’s your goal, see if you can runcycle to work or gym before your fast ends. If you find that you’re struggling due to low blood sugar, then workout after you’ve eaten your first meal and see if over time that changes.As we’ve said, people have intermittently fasted for donkey’s years. Ramadan is essentially an inverted intermittent fast (with believers fasting during the day rather than overnight). It’s not dangerous when you’re doing it sensibly.Just make sure that you already have a healthy relationship with food before you start messing around with it if you have a tendency to worry about dieting or calories, do not attempt to fast.Fasting could become a problem if you start to obsess over what you’re going to eat and keep increasing the fasting window. Sure, some yogis can go for three days without eating but if you’re pushing the physical boundaries in a bid to lose weight, then you may need to seek advice or help.Make sure that you really do get your full fill of food during your eating window – and if you’re struggling to eat when you do have the opportunity or you find yourself making that window increasingly smaller, contact somewhere like Beat, who can help.Over the next month, I’m going to be giving intermittent fasting a go to see just how easy and effective it really is.

He was ready to step up because the first 25 minutes were really tough.‘They played really well and we were under a bit of pressure.‘But then he got an assist with an excellent corner and he could have had another two or three with the quality of his passing.’One of the biggest conundrums facing Arteta should he be appointed concerns Aaron Ramsey’s future.Arsenal, yet again, find themselves in a scenario whereby one of their most important and influential players is left with just 12 months remaining on his contract.Ramsey has just enjoyed one of his best campaigns in an Arsenal shirt and was rewarded with the captain’s armband in Wenger’s final game.Were it not for his delicate contractual situation, the 27-year-old would represent a natural successor to Laurent Koscielny, whose days as a top class centre-half appear numbered after his Achilles’ gave up on him against Atletico Madrid.Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta were in Arsenal’s midfield together in the 2014 FA Cup final win over Hull (Picture: Getty)Reports claim Arsenal are minded to sell Ramsey, rather than allow him to run down his current deal, but losing a player of the Welshman’s quality would surely represent an early blow, given how highly Arteta rates his former midfield partner and the lack of funds he would have available to replace him.‘A player like this coming from midfield to score that many goals gives you something extra,’ Arteta noted after Ramsey scored a last minute opening day winner against Crystal Palace back in August 2015.‘He reminds me a bit of Fabregas when he was here. At his best, Fabregas was coming off the front, making the final ball and scoring very important goals.Aaron Ramsey’s current contract expires in the summer of 2019 (Picture: Getty)‘I think he will get better with experience and confidence. People fear him now because they know he can create things and that gives you an extra yard, which is very important.‘We don’t have someone to score 30 or 40 goals so players who can score from the middle is very important.’Arsenal’s measly warchest totals just £50million after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the second year in succession, according to reports.Those transfer funds could well be boosted by the sales of several high-profile first team players and Bellerin, perhaps, represents the most expendable given his value allied to the lack of significant progress he has made in recent years.The 23-year-old, who signed a long-term contract in October 2016, has nailed his colours to Arsenal’s mast in the last week, twice giving interviews in which he described London as his home.Hector Bellerin made his Arsenal debut, coming on a substitute for Mikel Arteta against West Brom in September 2013 (Picture: Getty)Despite his public pledge of loyalty, Manchester United and Juventus, as well as his former club Barcelona, continue to monitor his situation carefully. Given he claims to have predicted Bellerin’s rapid rise, Arteta will no doubt hope to keep hold of his compatriot.‘I’ve been really impressed with Hector since he came into the first team – perhaps even more with his attitude than his quality, because I knew all about that,’ Arteta said during Bellerin’s breakthrough 201415 season.‘He has the attributes to become one of the club’s most important players. He is very brave, his decision making is good and he’s a great athlete. He is very open, he is willing to understand what the manager and the team want from him on the pitch and his attitude and contribution have been really good.’Petr Ceh joined Arsenal from Chelsea in the summer of 2015 (Picture: Getty)Petr Cech has come nowhere close to fulfilling the prediction of John Terry, who claimed his former teammate would save his new team between 12 and 15 points a season, and will, in all likelihood, lose his position as Arsenal’s No.1 next season.Time has rapidly caught up with Cech’s battle-weary body and though his experience may well prove to be a useful asset, it is no surprise to see Arsenal being heavily linked with Bayer star Bernd Leno.Arteta faces a relatively straightforward task in demoting his former teammate, but the comments he made upon the veteran joining Arsenal are particularly telling.Bernd Leno has been heavily linked with a summer move to Arsenal (Picture: EPA)Cech’s hunger and bravery, clearly curried favour with Arteta, who clearly recognises the impact sound transfer business can have on a club as a whole.‘His ambition is coming out even though he has won everything in England and in Europe,’ said Arteta, almost two years ago.‘These type of signings give a lift to the whole team. He’s not just a good goalkeeper, he has experience, ambition.‘The decision he made to come here after being a legend at Chelsea is not easy. I don’t think many of them would do it at his age. He is still hungry and he wants to prove himself at the top again and it’s really good decision for us.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12349134.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pictures taken exactly time show world difference just miles apart","story":"Ivanka Trump (third from left) Israel Prime Minister’s wife Sara Netanyahu (second from left), Donald Trump’s son-in-law and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner (right) and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) attend the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem as Palestinians carry a wounded protester during clashes near the Gaza-Israel border (Picture: EPA)A baby who breathed in teargas was among 58 Palestinians killed in violent clashes along the Gaza border with Israel on Monday.Just a few miles away at almost the exact same time, Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner and several other senior White House figures were all smiles as they officially opened the new US embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.Ivanka’s father, US president Donald Trump tweeted it was a ‘great day for Israel’ while Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a ‘glorious day’.‘Remember this moment.

Go on a few viewings and you’re bound to discover that the living room you saw online is in fact just a sofa wedged awkwardly into one of the bedrooms.It’s hard to know what’s normal or what we can expect for what we can afford to pay.To make things a little clearer we launched What I Rent, a weekly series that takes you inside the homes of people renting in London.This week we’re having a nose around James’s one bedroom flat.James lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Crystal Palace. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Let’s chat money. How much are you paying each month?Never thought I’d pay four figures for rent. When I came to see the place I went thinking I wouldn’t take it, but once I stepped inside I was like, f*** it. It’s really decent and actually yeah, I would like a garden.And what about bills?About £150, I guess.Tell us about the location.The flat’s in Crystal Palace, about five mins walk from the best park in London.I can walk for about five minutes and look at a physical living farm animal which is absolutely mind-blowing, frankly. And of course there’s the dinosaurs.There’s a bloody decent Gipsy Hill pub practically next door called the Douglas Fir, the station is under 5 mins walk (and there’s no less than FIVE off-licences on that short way home, that’s like an off-licence per minute which is a really good number), up the hill there’s the Westow House pub which seems pretty lively, and the triangular high street that has a decent selection of shops and cracking views of London.There’s a bedroom, a living room and dining area, a kitchen, and a bathroom. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I think the other thing that hit me moving was how much more chilled out the south feels. I was in Stratford before which was flat, grey, and was kinda aggro.And how much greener it all is – I didn’t realise how much I liked trees until I was surrounded by them.I don’t think I’ll ever live north of the river again, and if I want to go there it’s p*ss easy to get to on the Overground*.I really don’t understand people that are so desperate to live in Zone 1 they pay £2k for a box room in Kensington or whatever. They are doing it wrong.*Until about midnight, in which case it’s buses from New Cross Gate or a train if you’re lucky.What’s the flat like?It’s a self-contained single bedroom flat, so just a bedroom, sitting room, one bathroom and kitchen.The bedroom’s not massive, but it does the job. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How long have you been there?It looks a bit spartan at the moment but I’m going to work on the garden and make it a cozy den with plants and lights and a barbecue, all that gaffDo you feel like you have enough space?Totally. The bedroom is a little cramped but I spend most of the time sitting in the garden or in the living room. Loads of storage in the kitchen.It’s not a huge place but it’s big enough. Be nice if the ceilings were a bit higher I guess, but I can’t really complain.How did you find it?First day of looking at places and saw some pretty awful ones (the view from one was a McDonald’s on a roundabout in a retail park in Charlton), then I had a look on OpenRent. Can’t recommend that site enough.I hear about everyone paying hundreds of pounds in fees and having to mess about with dodgy letting agents.I paid £20 in fees for a background check and the process of putting down a holding deposit was simple – I did it on my phone as soon as I left the viewing (you have to move so fast, the person viewing it before me was already talking money). Also I reckon the sort of landlord that’s going to use it is probably a bit more friendly and forward thinking – mine seems like a really nice bloke.James has only lived in the flat for a month, so is looking forward to make it more his own. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you like living alone?Well my girlfriend is here most of the time so it’s not like I’m lonely, but it’s nice having my own place again. Currently working on getting mates to travel all the way here on the regs but they seem quite happy to do this once they’ve sat in the park with a big bag of cans and realised how great it is.Is there anything you don’t like about where you live?It’s a bitch to get to once the Overground is done.We were at a rave in Hackney Marshes the other week and being on the bus for nearly two hours at 5AM when you’ve been dancing in a field for god know’s how long isn’t an experience I’d particularly recommend.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamAny plans to move again?I’m really happy here, I don’t think I’d want to live anywhere else in London really.When I move it’ll probably be to Berlin or Barcelona or somewhere like that.And… have you thought about buying a place?I’ve never seen that as something that was possible so I don’t waste time entertaining the thought.What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying.

I thought it would be an incredible way to see a fascinating and beautiful country.\u0027I\u0027d had a number of half-hearted attempts trying to put a run together, but after watching Forrest Gump one night, I had a light-bulb moment.\u0027My mum, who unfortunately isn\u0027t around anymore, was very aware of our impact on the word and always urged me to \u0027do one thing in life that makes a difference.\u0027\u0027I hoped that this run would be an opportunity to do just that - I\u0027m sure she would be very proud.\u0027My girlfriend, Nadine friends and family have been hugely supportive - I think they\u0027ve been half expecting me to do something crazy like this for a while.\u0027It meant everything to me to have Nadine and our newborn daughter, Bee, there at the finish line.\u0027Nadine has been my rock, I couldn\u0027t have done it without her - proposing in that moment felt right.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show baby Bee all of the photos in a few years\u0027 time.\u0027         Though an accomplished marathon runner, Rob admits he wishes he\u0027d done more training prior to his arrival in the US, as a series of nasty injuries have nearly brought a premature end to his inconceivable passage.           Rob ran through many iconic US landmarks - including the midpoint of Route 66 (pictured)          Rob uses running shoes to mark out the 407th day of his 590 day run          Rob poses on the border of Utah with his newborn baby Bee, the same place Forrest ended his epic trek in the 1994 classic film          Rob runs through one of many valleys on his epic US trek          The run began in Mobile, Alabama, in September 2016 and has taken Rob from west to east coast and back again.

Rob poses on Route 66 - he says he has sent a postcard to Forrest Gump actor Tom Hanks about the journey          Rob Pope (pictured after finishing the London marathon) broken the Guinness World Record for the fastest male marathon runner in a film character costumeRob said: \u0027Seeing my daughter be born was even more motivation - having her and Nadine at the finish was a dream come true.\u0027I didn\u0027t do any training specifically for the run.

I figured I\u0027d do the same.\u0027After my first injury - anterior tibial tendinitis - only 400 miles in, I had a break down in a gas station in front of a poor attendant - I\u0027d put too much into everything to become a failure.

For Rob, it was the words of his late mother that inspired him. She once told him: \u0027Do one thing in life that makes a difference\u0027          Rod said he has contacted Tom Hanks about his run, sending him a postcard from Maine, but he has not heard back from the actor          Having completed more than 15,000 miles Rob took a temporary hiatus in order to travel back to the UK and see girlfriend Nadine give birth, he then proposed to her on the finish line\u0027The enormity of it all, the repetition and loneliness have been mentally very tough.\u0027Fortunately though, I was only ever down for short periods, even if illness or injury persisted longer than that.\u0027As a generally very positive person, I had a strong focus - quitting was never going to be an option.\u0027The London Marathon was an added bonus, despite being a hot day I just went for it and even got to meet two of my heroes, Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge - it was a great feeling.\u0027Hoping to inspire others with the spirit of Forrest, Rob, who is still yet to hear from his hero, Tom Hanks, said: \u0027I think the film - and specifically the character of Forrest - is a beautiful tale of life and how we should treat one another.Rob said he had been planning to run across America for 15 years, but decided to recreate Forrest\u0027s route while watching the film one evening          Much like Forrest Gump in the film, Rob\u0027s run attracted attention from the press  Rob pictured competing in a marathon before undertaking his epic run across America\u0027Forrest didn\u0027t judge anyone, not on the colour of their skin, background, intelligence or anything else.\u0027If everyone could be a bit more like Forrest, the world would be a better place.\u0027This is my attempt to make a difference, just as my mum would\u0027ve wanted.\u0027I haven\u0027t heard from Tom yet, but I have sent him a postcard of the Port Clyde Lighthouse, when I completed my second crossing.\u0027He\u0027s an absolute hero of mine, so I\u0027d love to hear from him.\u0027It hasn\u0027t been hard to return back to my old life, I\u0027m a bit weird like that.\u0027I\u0027m a bit weird like that, but the beard is still there and the memories will last a lifetime.\u0027The charities were my main motivation behind this, so I\u0027ll be disappointed if I don\u0027t get over the 100,000 mark.\u0027In the words of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, don\u0027t let all the running be in vain.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/08/4C3AEB2900000578-0-image-a-3_1526369759087.jpg","title":"Pope says hes thought time leave","story":"Pope Francis, flanked by Bishop Angelo De Donatis, delivered a speech during a meeting with the Roman diocese, at the Vatican Basilica of St. John at the Lateran, in Rome, on Monday  Pope Francis, 81, has spoken in a homily about when it might be the right time to \u0027take leave\u0027 of his flock He said: \u0027When I read this, I think about myself, because I\u0027m a bishop and I\u0027ll have to take my leave.\u0027Francis has previously said that retired Pope Benedict XVI \u0027opened a door\u0027 to future popes by resigning. Although the 81-year-old pope has said he does not envisage a long papacy, he has not yet revealed when, or whether, he plans to retire.The Vatican has not released the full text from his homily. Mormon church is severing all ties with Boy Scouts after 105...\u0027I don\u0027t like your religion.

It has also hurt the pope\u0027s own image because this year he strongly defended a bishop accused in the alleged cover-up before reversing his position.Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of the city of San Bernardo said he could not rule out some of the tainted bishops resigning or being sacked, as many Chileans have demanded.\u0027It does not depend on us. Each person must decide this together with the pope,\u0027 he said.  Representatives of the Chilean bishops conference Luis Fernando Ramos Perez, left, and Juan Ignacio Gonzalez, met with reporters at the Vatican on Monday. Thirty-four Chilean bishops have been summoned to the Vatican over a cover-up of sexual abuse by clergyOne of the key bishops in the crisis is Juan Barros, whom the pope appointed to the southern city of Osorno in 2015 despite allegations that he had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor, Father Fernando Karadima. Barros has said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.Luis Badilla, a Rome-based Chilean commentator for the Vatican-affiliated blog \u0027Il Sismografo\u0027, called for \u0027exemplary and educational decisions\u0027 by the pope to put the Chilean Church back on course.During his trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were \u0027slander\u0027 until proven otherwise.But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. He produced a 2,300-page report that will be discussed at the Vatican meetings. Victims have also accused other bishops of either covering up the abuse by Karadima, of delaying investigations, or of discrediting victims in the media and demonizing them in private conversations and emails.Last month, Francis held four days of meetings with Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, three men abused by Karadima when they were teenagers in Santiago.They said in a statement afterwards that they had been \u0027treated as enemies\u0027 by Chilean Church leaders for 10 years.Karadima, who trained some of the bishops for the priesthood decades ago, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s.He never faced civilian justice because of the statute of limitations.

The friend says Cook and Dexter had been \u0027texting each other for days\u0027 before he invited her over to his home. Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027           The friend revealed that Dexter (pictured with Cook in his home) was unhappy about Cook\u0027s claim that the encounter never happened           This is Cook\u0027s $2.2million waterfront property where the two spent five days together \u0027Peter flew her to LaGuardia (airport) on Thursday and she spent the first night at a friend\u0027s house in East Hampton then on Friday Peter came and met her at The American Hotel.\u0027When Peter arrived, Kasey immediately thought he was hot. He obviously felt the same because she had sent him a lot of sexy pictures so there was definitely chemistry.\u0027Moore says that when they went back to Cook\u0027s house all he wanted to do was \u0027have sex\u0027.\u0027She said he wasn\u0027t a bad guy like she had heard, in fact she really liked him,\u0027 she said.Share this article\u0027He took her for manicures and pedicures and they went to the movie \u0027I Feel Pretty\u0027 with Amy Schumer. They actually had fun together, so it was really hurtful to her when he denied they even were together.\u0027They really got to know each other. Every night they watched old classic movies and he made her latte\u0027s in the morning and brought them to bed.\u0027It seems ridiculous that he would deny it. It\u0027s wrong for him to be embarrassed since he flew her there and she is beautiful and they spent so many days together.\u0027           Cook, who was married to supermodel Christie Brinkley for 12 years, is said to have a \u0027secret pathological predilection\u0027 for younger women.

The two ended their relationship earlier this year Moore claims Cook even bought Dexter a new cell phone, on which many of the photos obtained by DailyMail.com were taken.\u0027That\u0027s another reason why he can\u0027t deny they had an \u0027encounter\u0027 as he referred to it,\u0027 said Moore.\u0027It seems like Peter still wants to be with her because he keeps texting her.\u0027But she might be done with him because he is acting ridiculous about their relationship being public.

I thought it would be an incredible way to see a fascinating and beautiful country.\u0027I\u0027d had a number of half-hearted attempts trying to put a run together, but after watching Forrest Gump one night, I had a light-bulb moment.\u0027My mum, who unfortunately isn\u0027t around anymore, was very aware of our impact on the word and always urged me to \u0027do one thing in life that makes a difference.\u0027\u0027I hoped that this run would be an opportunity to do just that - I\u0027m sure she would be very proud.\u0027My girlfriend, Nadine friends and family have been hugely supportive - I think they\u0027ve been half expecting me to do something crazy like this for a while.\u0027It meant everything to me to have Nadine and our newborn daughter, Bee, there at the finish line.\u0027Nadine has been my rock, I couldn\u0027t have done it without her - proposing in that moment felt right.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show baby Bee all of the photos in a few years\u0027 time.\u0027         Though an accomplished marathon runner, Rob admits he wishes he\u0027d done more training prior to his arrival in the US, as a series of nasty injuries have nearly brought a premature end to his inconceivable passage.           Rob ran through many iconic US landmarks - including the midpoint of Route 66 (pictured)          Rob uses running shoes to mark out the 407th day of his 590 day run          Rob poses on the border of Utah with his newborn baby Bee, the same place Forrest ended his epic trek in the 1994 classic film          Rob runs through one of many valleys on his epic US trek          The run began in Mobile, Alabama, in September 2016 and has taken Rob from west to east coast and back again.

Rob poses on Route 66 - he says he has sent a postcard to Forrest Gump actor Tom Hanks about the journey          Rob Pope (pictured after finishing the London marathon) broken the Guinness World Record for the fastest male marathon runner in a film character costumeRob said: \u0027Seeing my daughter be born was even more motivation - having her and Nadine at the finish was a dream come true.\u0027I didn\u0027t do any training specifically for the run.

I figured I\u0027d do the same.\u0027After my first injury - anterior tibial tendinitis - only 400 miles in, I had a break down in a gas station in front of a poor attendant - I\u0027d put too much into everything to become a failure.

For Rob, it was the words of his late mother that inspired him. She once told him: \u0027Do one thing in life that makes a difference\u0027          Rod said he has contacted Tom Hanks about his run, sending him a postcard from Maine, but he has not heard back from the actor          Having completed more than 15,000 miles Rob took a temporary hiatus in order to travel back to the UK and see girlfriend Nadine give birth, he then proposed to her on the finish line\u0027The enormity of it all, the repetition and loneliness have been mentally very tough.\u0027Fortunately though, I was only ever down for short periods, even if illness or injury persisted longer than that.\u0027As a generally very positive person, I had a strong focus - quitting was never going to be an option.\u0027The London Marathon was an added bonus, despite being a hot day I just went for it and even got to meet two of my heroes, Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge - it was a great feeling.\u0027Hoping to inspire others with the spirit of Forrest, Rob, who is still yet to hear from his hero, Tom Hanks, said: \u0027I think the film - and specifically the character of Forrest - is a beautiful tale of life and how we should treat one another.Rob said he had been planning to run across America for 15 years, but decided to recreate Forrest\u0027s route while watching the film one evening          Much like Forrest Gump in the film, Rob\u0027s run attracted attention from the press  Rob pictured competing in a marathon before undertaking his epic run across America\u0027Forrest didn\u0027t judge anyone, not on the colour of their skin, background, intelligence or anything else.\u0027If everyone could be a bit more like Forrest, the world would be a better place.\u0027This is my attempt to make a difference, just as my mum would\u0027ve wanted.\u0027I haven\u0027t heard from Tom yet, but I have sent him a postcard of the Port Clyde Lighthouse, when I completed my second crossing.\u0027He\u0027s an absolute hero of mine, so I\u0027d love to hear from him.\u0027It hasn\u0027t been hard to return back to my old life, I\u0027m a bit weird like that.\u0027I\u0027m a bit weird like that, but the beard is still there and the memories will last a lifetime.\u0027The charities were my main motivation behind this, so I\u0027ll be disappointed if I don\u0027t get over the 100,000 mark.\u0027In the words of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, don\u0027t let all the running be in vain.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/09/4C424CD900000578-0-image-m-5_1526373099533.jpg","title":"Pope says hes thought time leave","story":"Pope Francis, flanked by Bishop Angelo De Donatis, delivered a speech during a meeting with the Roman diocese, at the Vatican Basilica of St. John at the Lateran, in Rome, on Monday  Pope Francis, 81, has spoken in a homily about when it might be the right time to \u0027take leave\u0027 of his flock He said: \u0027When I read this, I think about myself, because I\u0027m a bishop and I\u0027ll have to take my leave.\u0027Francis has previously said that retired Pope Benedict XVI \u0027opened a door\u0027 to future popes by resigning. Although the 81-year-old pope has said he does not envisage a long papacy, he has not yet revealed when, or whether, he plans to retire.The Vatican has not released the full text from his homily. Mormon church is severing all ties with Boy Scouts after 105...\u0027I don\u0027t like your religion.

It has also hurt the pope\u0027s own image because this year he strongly defended a bishop accused in the alleged cover-up before reversing his position.Bishop Juan Ignacio Gonzalez of the city of San Bernardo said he could not rule out some of the tainted bishops resigning or being sacked, as many Chileans have demanded.\u0027It does not depend on us. Each person must decide this together with the pope,\u0027 he said.  Representatives of the Chilean bishops conference Luis Fernando Ramos Perez, left, and Juan Ignacio Gonzalez, met with reporters at the Vatican on Monday. Thirty-four Chilean bishops have been summoned to the Vatican over a cover-up of sexual abuse by clergyOne of the key bishops in the crisis is Juan Barros, whom the pope appointed to the southern city of Osorno in 2015 despite allegations that he had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor, Father Fernando Karadima. Barros has said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.Luis Badilla, a Rome-based Chilean commentator for the Vatican-affiliated blog \u0027Il Sismografo\u0027, called for \u0027exemplary and educational decisions\u0027 by the pope to put the Chilean Church back on course.During his trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were \u0027slander\u0027 until proven otherwise.But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. He produced a 2,300-page report that will be discussed at the Vatican meetings. Victims have also accused other bishops of either covering up the abuse by Karadima, of delaying investigations, or of discrediting victims in the media and demonizing them in private conversations and emails.Last month, Francis held four days of meetings with Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo, three men abused by Karadima when they were teenagers in Santiago.They said in a statement afterwards that they had been \u0027treated as enemies\u0027 by Chilean Church leaders for 10 years.Karadima, who trained some of the bishops for the priesthood decades ago, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s.He never faced civilian justice because of the statute of limitations. Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile, Karadima has always denied the allegations.At the pre-meeting news conference, Gonzalez said he had met many victims and knew the three who met the pope last month.One of the victims, Cruz, later tweeted: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen him before in my life. The truth according to the bishops of Chile is very different from what we all have lived.\u0027In a stern statement last Saturday, the Vatican indicated that the pope intended to be tough.It spoke of \u0027cover-ups and grave omissions regarding the victims\u0027 and said the meetings would seek to determine \u0027collective and inidual responsibility for these devastating wounds\u0027.In a homily at his daily morning Mass on Tuesday, without specifically mentioning Chile, Francis said every bishop should know \u0027when itâs time to take his leave and step down\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/15/4C3A308800000578-0-image-m-47_1526309582118.jpg","title":"Dutch researchers read 2 covered pages Anne Frank diary","story":"Revelations: Teresien da Silva, left, and Ronald Leopold of the Anne Frank Foundation show a facsimile of the diary with two pages taped off during a press conference in AmsterdamAnti-Semitic songwriter who claims the Holocaust is...Trump signs Holocaust property law that has angered PolandGermany\u0027s AfD decides not to expel critic of Holocaust...Share this articleDiscovery: The text underneath two taped off pages from Anne Frank\u0027s diary reveal risque jokes and an explanation of sex and prostitution  A video shows how two pages taped off with brown masking paper from Anne Frank\u0027s diary being photographed to reveal her writingThe Frank family, originally from Frankfurt in Germany, had left for the Netherlands when the Nazis gained control in the 1930s.By 1940, the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped in Amsterdam.In 1942, the family went into hiding in secret rooms at the back of her father Otto Frank\u0027s office building.

It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next levelHelsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next level“A library card was the first thing that was mine, that I had ever owned,” says Nasima Razmyar. The daughter of a former Afghan diplomat, Razmyar arrived in Finland with her family in 1992 as a refugee fleeing political unrest. Unable to speak the language, with scant resources, and trying to make sense of the strange new city she found herself in, she was stunned to discover she was entitled to a library card that would grant her books – for free. Her appreciation of the privilege has not faded: “I still have that library card in my wallet today,” she says proudly.Today, Razmyar is deputy mayor of Helsinki, and ready to champion the institution that has given her so much – starting with the construction of Oodi, the city’s new central library, due to open in December. She is not alone in her passion for libraries. “Finland is a country of readers,” declared the country’s UK ambassador Päivi Luostarinen recently, and it’s hard to argue with her. In 2016 the UN named Finland the world’s most literate nation, and Finns are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of public libraries – the country’s 5.5m million people borrow close to 68m books a year.Oodi – Ode in English – is more than a sober monument to civic pride. Commissioned as part of Finland’s celebration of a century of independence, the library is no mere book repository. “I think Finland could not have given a better gift to the people. It symbolises the significance of learning and education, which have been fundamental factors for Finland’s development and success,” says Razmyar. Libraries are seen as the visible face of the Finnish belief in education, equality and good citizenship. “There’s strong belief in education for all,” says Hanna Harris, director of Archinfo Finland and Mind-building’s commissioner. “There is an appreciation of active citizenship – the idea that it is something that everyone is entitled to. Libraries embody that strongly,” she adds.Those feelings of pride in the equality of opportunity offered by the city’s new library are echoed by the site chosen for Oodi: directly opposite parliament. “I think there is no other actor that could stand in front of the grounds of democracy like the public library does,” says Razmyar. “It’s remarkable that when standing on the open balcony of the library people are looking straight into the parliament and standing on the same level.”But Oodi isn’t the only Helsinki library to cause excitement. “Töölö library is one of my favourites,” says Harris. “It’s set in a park and has a rooftop balcony. Recently my colleagues and I went down there and there was a queue outside the doors – on a regular weekday morning, there was a queue at 9am to get in.”Perhaps a clue to the Finnish enthusiasm for libraries comes from the fact that they offer far more than books. While many libraries worldwide provide internet access and other services, libraries in cities and towns across Finland have expanded their brief to include lending e-publications, sports equipment, power tools and other “items of occasional use”. One library in Vantaa even offers karaoke.These spaces are not designed to be dusty temples to literacy. They are vibrant, well-thought-out spaces actively trying to engage the urban communities who use them. The library in Maunula, a northern Helsinki suburb, has a doorway that leads directly to a supermarket – a striking and functional decision which, along with its adult education centre and youth services section, was partly down to the fact that it was designed with input from locals. Oodi, however, will go even further: in addition to its core function as a library, it will boast a cafe, restaurant, public balcony, cinema, audiovisual recording studios and a makerspace with 3D printers. A sauna was apparently considered, but seems not to have made the final cut.This ersity is key, argues Razmyar. “Libraries must reach out to the new generations. The world is changing – so libraries are changing too. People need places to meet, to work, to develop their digital skills.”The site and design of Helsinki’s new library are certainly striking, but perhaps the most impressive thing about it is the lack of public opposition to such a costly project. “People are looking forward to Oodi. It’s not been contentious: people are excited about it across the board,” says Archinfo director Harris. “It will be important to daily life here in Helsinki.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43a0ed2bb317bcdacb7247e73b08c90e9af482c/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3f36ef35a3cfdb66ee6b0e4be6dfbe","title":"what have the royals done for the arts meghan markle prince harry wedding","story":"From the RSC to the ROH, Britain’s most prestigious arts institutions are all by royal appointment. But as Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle, is it goodbye Royal Variety Show and hello Royal Reprezent FM?The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle means many things to many people, but, while loyalists are bagging their picnic spots and unpacking the union-jack party plates, some hard-pressed arts organisations will be taking a longer view.Once the party is over, reality strikes: a royal wedding means the admittance of a new member into “the firm” – and for them, a lifetime of public patronage. It has already been announced that Markle will become a partner in the Royal Foundation, set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 as an umbrella for a clutch of charities. Besides youth work, the foundation’s portfolio is dominated by the princes’ preoccupations with the armed forces and conservation, while the charities that will be picked for Markle’s inidual support will – in Palace parlance – “reflect Miss Markle’s own interests”.The National Portrait Gallery and the art therapy organisation, Art Room, were among the first four charities to be chosen for her future sister-in-law, Kate. A clue as to where Markle’s interests might lead her – as a cosmopolitan mixed-race TV actor, with avowedly feminist views – lies in the couple’s second official engagement in January. It took them (on their own request) to the “youth-led” radio station Reprezent FM, in Brixton, south London, which is credited with launching the careers of a galaxy of DJs and grime stars, including this year’s Brit award-winner Stormzy.But what does royal patronage actually mean for the arts? For Reprezent, which was saved from closure three years ago by a crowd-funding appeal, even a one-off visit has been an overwhelming experience. “To be honest, we’re hunkered down. We’ve been inundated with requests, and there’s been a three-line whip across the board not to talk to the press about anything at all,” said their phone operator.Over the next four years, the specialist graduate college – whose alumni include Sylvia Pankhurst, Ian Dury, David Hockney and Tracey Emin – will expand to a new campus in Battersea and increase its student numbers from 1,900 to 3,000. It already recruits from 74 countries and the rapid growth both in numbers and costs will increasingly involve looking overseas, where the word “royal” is an invaluable calling card.“The royal connection has always been hugely beneficial when being seen on the international stage,” said a spokeswoman, “so we are no different from other great institutions such as the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Rada, Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company.” As Andy Hillier, editor of the charity sector magazine Third Sector, points out, the two great advantages of a royal association are publicity and trust. “For smaller organisations, the biggest advantage is publicity because it can be very difficult to draw attention to yourself. For larger organisations, the publicity benefit might not be so obvious unless you’re staging a big event, but trust is a big issue at the moment, and if you have a royal patron there is an assumption that there’s a royal stamp of approval and that you will have been thoroughly vetted.”The twists and turns of royal support are as bewildering as the Hampton Court maze. Presidencies and patronships come with varying, and not always consistent, levels of commitment. As a “royal visitor” Prince Charles is unlikely to visit the RCA much, though it hopes to profit from a hook-up with the Royal Drawing School, which he co-founded in 2000 as the Prince’s Drawing School, but which only went on to earn its “Royal” appellation in 2014. The announcement of this upgrade, by an institution that could be seen as the result of a hobbyist’s anachronistic obsession with “observational drawing”, is revealing: “With this name change, the Royal Drawing School joins the Royal Academy (1768), the Royal College of Music (1882), the Royal College of Art (1896) the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1920) and the Royal Ballet School (1956), as a member of the small circle of prestigious, world-renowned arts education institutions to bear the Royal title. It is the first such institution to be granted the name since the Royal Ballet School, which received its title in 1956 – the fourth year of the reign of HM Queen Elizabeth II.”The Royal College of Art’s headquarters – along with the Royal College of Music – are in an area of London once known as Albertopolis, in memory of the royal spouse who played a bigger role than others in the development of the UK’s enduring cultural capital.Prince Albert was the driving force behind the Great Exhibition, staged in a custom-built Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851 with the not inconsiderable ambition, according to Queen Victoria, “to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world”.Despite the disapproval of critics including Karl Marx, who deplored it as an “emblem of the capitalist fetishism of commodities”, the self-financing extravaganza, which is said to have been visited by six million people, turned in a profit big enough to buy a swath of land in South Kensington for a new cultural quarter that would include the three great national museums on Exhibition Road and the Royal Albert Hall.It’s a mark of the decline of royal power that, while Albert could influence the shape of a city, Prince Charles has had to content himself with a model village, incarnating his ardent architectural philosophy in the Beatrix Potter cottages and Disneyland castles of Poundbury, a new town that was planned and developed at his command on 400 acres of Dorset land from 1989.But, though the capacities of this century’s royal patrons might be reduced, their credibility has greatly improved since the late 1980s, when National Theatre director Richard Eyre fought a valiant rearguard action against being landed with a royal charter. “The ‘Royal National’ nonsense has burst like a fat blister,” he wrote in his diary in June 1988. “I haven’t yet had to publicly defend it, and am not looking forward to having to lie in public … Neal Ascherson writes to me that ‘everyone is looking to you to stop this royal nonsense’.”Thirty years on, Ascherson – a leading Scottish author and academic – feels just as strongly. “I’m not a fanatical anti-monarchist,” he says. “What I fancy is a country with republican institutions which, if people wanted, could have an ornamental bobble-king on top, like the royal republic of Norway.” Ironically, given her propaganda wars with “the firm”, the change in public opinion was partly due to Princess Diana’s touchy-feely support of charities working in previously stigmatised fields such as support for people with Aids and leprosy. Hillier points out that the younger generation have continued that tradition by extending royal patronage into mental health, “which is not an area the royal family has supported in the past”. He cites their support for the Heads Together campaign – encouraging people to be more open about mental illness – which involves a partnership with existing charities to challenge this social taboo. In today’s celebrity culture, part of their value is their ability to pull in showbiz stars – as Prince William did for Heads Together with Lady Gaga last year. Their four-minute Facetime chat, filmed in Kensington Palace and Lady Gaga’s Hollywood kitchen, was part of a series of celebrity heart-to-hearts that are now on YouTube.But to what extent do these enthusiasms extend beyond celebrity to the arts themselves? Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has concentrated on reading charities, with patronages including the National Literacy Trust and Book Trust. At the more glitzy end she’s become a regular at the Man Booker prize dinner, and will be hosting its 50th anniversary celebrations in July with a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles – who has never sold himself as a great reader, though he’s known to love a spot of Shakespeare – discreetly backs (and personally attends) the Boswell book festival in the Scottish countryside. The boutique fiesta of biography and memoir takes place in Dumfries House – a Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that he rescued and restored, and which recently joined his School of Traditional Arts as part of the Prince’s Foundation.Prince Charles has never been one for public displays of emotion, but it won’t have escaped fans of Markle’s best-known TV role – paralegal Rachel in the series Suits – that one of her strongest suits is a capacity to emote to order. Social deprivation is likely to feature in her charity choices, with the arts as enablers. While Dumfries House is at the Chippendale end of royal patronages, it’s a fair bet that Markle’s furnishings will be more street than five-star suite.

This giant straw hat is absurd to look at on a catwalk, but worn on a sandy beach, and photographed from behind, it encapsulates everything that summer is – and everything you want to be when you wear it. In short, to be seen while not being seen, ideally on holiday.It has also kickstarted what looks like the defining Instagram trend of the summer – hats with brims of alarming diameter. At Sensi, they are large and paper-braided, while versions at Topshop and Off White, although smaller, come with a wide brim as flat as the Norfolk Broads. At Missoni, they are shaped like an exaggerated wimple. At Gucci, they tie under the chin with a ribbon. At Delpozo, they are more bow-like than hat-like, but the sentiment remains.Dig deeper, and oversized hats serve the same seenunseen purpose on celebrities. Melania Trump hid beneath a white one designed by Hervé Pierre when the Macrons visited the White House. Justin Bieber dodged speculation over his love life in a straw version as he took a “meditative hike” through the hills.Jacquemus is the French label for cool French women. The Jacquemus girl, the handsome, oft-tanned designer Simon Porte Jacquemus once told the , “is not Parisian, and that is important. She is French, and French girls are not elegant, they are raw, casual, spontaneous.” It is also a label that likes to play with scale when it comes to accessories. His tiny Le Sac Chiquito handbags are the size of your fist, yet are the It bag of summer 2018. The La Bomba hat is the size of a manta ray, making it impossible to transport, yet it is long sold out and, even if it wasn’t, is comically antisocial, shielding not just its wearer from the sun but anyone on the same stretch of beach. And yet ...Hats have become heavy with meaning, and a good way to signal an allegiance – be it Trump’s red baseball cap or the pink pussy hats. If autumn 2017 was dominated by baseball caps worn by people who wouldn’t normally wear baseball caps, then other kinds of hats are successfully revised each season, and do the same job. See berets, stetsons and, now, straw hats. Much like Lenny Kravitz’s famously large scarf a few years ago, hats are the quickest way to signal a “don’t look at me, but, like, do” level of fame.If Instagram 2017 was all about tropical kitschiness, starring flamingos and cacti among other twee nostalgic tics, then this is the summer of the giant parody straw hat. Some shade intended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5090a92b01d584b80a163b26557daef9ff3743d/0_339_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42739aee34b229c28403a628567788e1","title":"asako i ii review japanese romcom flips gaze ryusuke hamaguchi","story":"Ryūsuke Hamaguchi’s earnest romance switches things up by having a woman obsessed with a man’s beauty and then falling for his doubleHere is a quibblingly titled movie from Japan that turns out to be an odd doppelganger romance of YA earnestness, directed and co-written by Ryūsuke Hamaguchi, adapted from the novel by Tomoka Shibasaki. It has a kind of counter-Vertigo theme, a tale of mirror-image obsession, but where this kind of thing is usually about the possessive male gaze and passively enigmatic female beauty, here things are reversed. Asako is about the female gaze, and male beauty.Erika Karata plays Asako, a college student in Kyoto, demure, hardworking, self-effacing and possessed of a doll-like beauty. One day she attends a photographic exhibition and outside chances across Baku (Masahiro Higashide), a fellow student who is hardly less pretty than she is: cool, careless, like the solo breakout star of a boyband. Baku waltzes up to Asako, chats a little and then presumes to kiss her. Within an instant, she is in love, and they are an item, to the dismay of Asako’s loyal pal Haruyo (Sairi Itô), who knows about Baku’s irresponsible-heartbreaker reputation. One day, Baku does precisely what everyone feared: he wanders off and capriciously vanishes from Asako’s life, having evidently dropped out of school.Cut to two years later, and Asako is working at a coffee shop in Tokyo, which does outside catering at business events. While turning up to clear away the cups and thermos canisters at some conference, she is astonished to see Ryôhei, a nice-looking but rather boring suit-wearing young salaryman. He is the dead spit of super-glam Baku, like his dull twin, and is of course played by the same actor. She is mesmerised by the resemblance there is no one around from her home town to confirm her astonishment, and even after chatting to him and scraping up a friendship, she can’t bring herself to confess this deeply strange coincidence to him. And so she embarks on a relationship with poor, unknowing Ryôhei, based on his poignant resemblance to someone much cooler, much sexier and more fascinating who has disappeared like a dream. But then, just as she has forgotten about Baku and is perfectly happy with Ryôhei, and has formed a happy circle of friends in Tokyo based on getting to know him, she sees a very familiar gorgeous face on a billboard and everything is back up in the air.I wondered if a certain Hitchcockian twist was coming the audience’s way. And you can’t help wondering. People watching a realistic film, set in the recognisable modern world – and not in, say, the magical-twin world of Shakespearian comedy – can’t be blamed for demanding some sort of explanation for a resemblance so exact that the film is using the same actor. And indeed it is great work from Higashide.Well, I’m not sure that Asako I \u0026amp II either furnishes an explanation, or styles out the lack of one. But it is an arresting metaphor for a certain phenomenon: settling. Asako wanted sexy love-god Baku, but settled for dependable, reliable Ryôhei in the idealised romantic image she carries around. And in fact it is Ryôhei who is entitled to consider himself as having the supernaturally ideal life: he’s extremely handsome, as well as being nice. But that is not how these things work. We all carry around with us a high school or college memory of heartbreak, and thus preserve around that culprit – always accessible in these social media times – a false romantic cachet. This is an amusing essay in amorous delusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de222efac3e6f9f13488d73f607c41c7922b71f/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24038419075b74dc8a0b2fc0fb49acd6","title":"vomitive pathetic lars von trier film prompts mass walkouts at cannes","story":"More than 100 people said to have exited early from a screening for The House That Jack Built, which features scenes of duckling mutilation and child killingDanish director Lars Von Trier’s much-anticipated return to Cannes has resulted – with some predictability – in controversy, as a screening of his new film The House That Jack Built was met with mass walkouts.The blackly comic thriller, which stars Matt Dillon and Uma Thurman, follows the murder spree of a serial killer over the course of several decades. Advance word on the film suggested that it would feature scenes of sadistic violence and brutality, with Cannes director Thierry Frémaux saying that it featured “a subject so controversial” that it could only appear in an out-of-competition slot at the festival.That advance billing seems to have been lived up to, with Variety’s Ramin Setoodeh reporting more than 100 people leaving the cinema prematurely due to the film’s “disgusting” content. “Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic,” wrote one attendee on Twitter, while entertainment reporter Roger Friedman described it as a “vile movie” that “should not have been made”. “He mutilates Riley Keough, he mutilates children... and we are all there in formal dress expected to watch it?” another viewer told Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan. Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela also left the screening early, stating that “seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment”.The scene which seems to have prompted the majority of walkouts is one in which Dillon’s character shoots two children at a family picnic in the head with a rifle. In another Keogh’s character is seen having her breast sliced off, while a flashback scene shows a child removing a duckling’s leg with a pair of pliers. Archive footage from concentration camps is also shown.Von Trier was making his first appearance on the Croisette since being declared “persona not grata” by the festival over a 2011 press conference in which he joked about sympathising with the Nazis. At the time the Cannes board declared the director’s comments “unacceptable, intolerable, and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival”. However, last month Cannes overturned the ban, with Frémaux saying that it was a “punishment that was disproportionate and that had lasted long enough”. That decision was greeted negatively in some quarters, with critics pointing to allegations made by the musician Björk, who claimed that Von Trier had sexually harassed her on the set of his film Dancer in the Dark. Von Trier denies the allegations.Critical response to The House That Jack Built has been largely negative. In a two-star review, the ’s Peter Bradshaw wrote that the film was “an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness that was every bit as exasperating as I had feared”, though he did admit that he was impressed by its “spectacular horror finale”. Also giving the film two stars was the ’s Robbie Collin, who wrote it “feels like way too much and nowhere near enough”, while, in an F-grade review, The Playlist’s Jessica Kiang described it as “misogynistic” and “irredeemably unpleasant”.Not everyone seems to have been appalled by The House That Jack Built, however. Setoodeh reports that the film received a standing ovation at the Cannes premiere, which prompted someone sitting near him to declare: “They’ll clap for anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeefdcd79e319bbc3ee471fcbf14a5996291578f/1157_198_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1399a177d5a77a17293d006c6468972","title":"margot kidder a life in pictures","story":"The 69-year-old actor, known for roles in Superman and The Amityville Horror, has died of throat cancer.

Both players went on to play in the calamitous defeat against Iceland in Nice that signalled the end of England’s Euro 2016 campaign and prompted Hodgson’s resignation, though neither is particularly tainted by the sort of tournament failure that has come to haunt teams from this country.Wilshere’s career has been bedevilled by injury, which is how he came to lose his place at Arsenal after an impressive climb through the youth ranks, and the season he spent on loan at Bournemouth after Euro 2016 could be regarded only as a qualified success. Once he was no longer integral to Arsenal plans he was no longer guaranteed an England call-up either and, if he does drop out of the reckoning for the World Cup in Russia, it will simply be the culmination of several seasons of disappointment.When Wilshere first broke through he looked so cultured and comfortable that people were talking in terms of a century of caps, or at least being a fixture on the international stage for a decade or more, which amounts to more or less the same thing.At 26, with 34 caps, it is now beginning to look as if he may not reach 50. He has undoubtedly been unlucky with the timing of some of his injuries, though it could also be said he has not always made the most of his opportunities.He has seen players such as Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson establish themselves through being more forceful on the pitch. In all probability Wilshere would have made it to Russia only as a squad player in any case and in that capacity his claims are now being challenged by Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.Hart’s is a completely different story. Though occasionally error‑prone with England, just as with Manchester City, the goalkeeper might still be clocking up appearances for both had not Pep Guardiola arrived and decided his distribution was not up to scratch – not just his ability with the ball at his feet inside and outside the box, but his accuracy with goalkicks and long clearances.Guardiola sets high standards for goalkeepers he wants the complete package. Claudio Bravo, Hart’s immediate replacement at City, was hardly that – the Chilean was not in the England player’s league as a shot‑stopper – though now Ederson has been brought in with an immaculate range of goalkeeping attributes there are far fewer people arguing Hart has been harshly treated.Nonetheless the goalkeeper is at the moment looking for a club after failing to win a regular place at West Ham and not quite answering his critics when on loan at Turin the previous season.Hart has 75 caps and has just turned 31 – no age at all for a goalkeeper – yet more doors seem to be closing than opening and after very publicly failing to live up to the standards required by a succession of managers there must now be question marks over his confidence.Doubtless he could find a berth almost anywhere as a reserve goalkeeper, which is in effect what he became when on loan at West Ham, though the role does not suit everyone.If Hart wishes to continue in a first team, he may have to consider dropping down the league a little and finding a club who would be glad of his considerable experience.That might be hard to swallow for a player whose two league titles are still fresh in the memory, along with four golden glove awards from his time as No\u0026nbsp1 at the Etihad Stadium, though it is already clear City have moved on. If Hart is to do the same, he needs to find regular football. With a bit of luck and the right club there may still be time left for a comeback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9ee01ed4e0e043c9efad6c7e5805e791c77b06/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3b86b972c000f2d5a5aad37d87d1c6e","title":"joe hart england world cup squad out gareth southgate west ham","story":"• Gareth Southgate to include Fabian Delph and Ashley Young• Nick Pope expected to get call-up but no place for Ryan BertrandJack Wilshere and Joe Hart have been omitted from England’s squad for this summer’s World Cup but there is a place in Gareth Southgate’s selection for Fabian Delph.Wilshere has missed out after being called up for the friendlies against Italy and the Netherlands in March only to withdraw because of injury. The Arsenal midfielder, who has not played for his country since Euro 2016, started only 12 Premier League games in the season just finished and a historically fragile body may have counted against him given the demands of a tournament.In leaving out Hart, Southgate has chosen to ignore his most experienced player. The Manchester City goalkeeper, who has spent the season on loan at West Ham, was told on Monday in a phone-call from the England manager that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals despite Southgate having considered the 31-year-old his first choice for much of his tenure. Hart won his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil in November but Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland started the friendlies in March and have usurped him in the pecking order.The suggestion had been Hart would still travel to the World Cup as an experienced third-choice – only Gary Cahill and Jermain Defoe of Southgate’s recent selections have more than 50 caps, with neither expected to make the cut for Russia – and would have been willing to fulfil that role, but his toils at club level appear to have counted against him.He has endured an indifferent spell on-loan at West Ham this season, losing his place towards the end of November to Adrián and starting only 19 league games in total. He regained his place after a 4-1 defeat at Swansea in March, but there were subsequent high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke. His last appearance was a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April.Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is the likeliest to replace Hart in the 23-man squad, which Southgate will reveal on Wednesday.Delph’s inclusion follows a season in which he has been successfully remodelled as a left-back at City by Pep Guardiola. The 28-year-old has been more naturally a central midfielder and brings versatility to Southgate’s squad. The left-back Ryan Bertrand has been left out but Ashley Young will be part of the squad.The Burnley defender James Tarkowski, who has one cap, is understood to be on the standby list. Southgate is expected to select Phil Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f5fe466233c05c9ea48c1b127d3e736b284c94/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ee75f657d9effe1353bf093f91034c","title":"mikel arteta favourite to become arsenal manager replace wenger","story":"Mikel Arteta is the strong favourite to succeed Arsène Wenger as manager at Arsenal, with productive talks having progressed between his camp and the club.Conversations are so advanced that Arteta is giving thought to the people he might want in his backroom team.

But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, orced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette.Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride.Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.”One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes.In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.”Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.”It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights.Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle.Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.”Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone).Any knotty family matters – orced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb1562241815b3fe99e3f50363d6960ac4cf8f0/487_1306_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d49b7055982eb4b58c9648f858553f","title":"nigel slater bresaola peas and feta recipe","story":"A fresh and sprightly piquant spring saladPut the juice of half a lemon, 6 tbsp of olive oil, 8 mint leaves and a small handful of parsley leaves into a blender, season with a little salt and process to a thick, bright green dressing.Slice a couple of medium-sized tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a serving plate then moisten them with a spoonful of the dressing.

We will not impose a border. If there is a deal to be done about the border it will be precisely that: a deal. Nonetheless, if one side keeps refusing to bargain, no deal will be struck.”The intervention came after May held private meetings with dozens of Conservative backbench MPs to try to explain the two options for customs arrangements with the EU. She and Rees-Mogg are reported to have clashed over the consequences for the Irish border during their meeting.The inner Brexit cabinet meets again on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the two rival plans. May still faces having to deal with a significant split among ministers over whether to back a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border.Conservative MPs were invited to five separate sessions at the Department for Exiting the European Union, where May made introductory remarks and took questions. Her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then gave a “neutral, technical” presentation of both options, with MPs given the chance to press him further on the detail afterwards. A Brexiter source said the presentation had been “neutral to the point of being incoherent”.David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the cabinet would “test proposals to destruction” and denied the arguments were coming too late in the process. “We’ve been very focused on other aspects of Brexit, agreeing the withdrawal agreement, the implementation period. The EU themselves set a timescale to discuss these issues and it’s right that we’re focusing on it now,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We are focusing on it in a way that ensures that we get it right, that we test proposals to destruction.” Asked if that phrasing meant he agreed with Boris Johnson’s assessment that the customs partnership was “crazy”, Mundell said: “I agree with cabinet collective responsibility, we’ll look in detail at proposals that have been worked through by the sub-committees.”Before the full Brexit subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, May also faced pressure from the former John Lewis boss Andy Street, who won the West Midlands mayoralty in a surprise win over Labour last year.Street, a Tory remainer, said his region’s car industry was facing an uncertain future without a comprehensive customs deal. His remarks echo those made last week by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who favours the customs partnership option.“As the cabinet examines the different systems for administering customs after Brexit, it must ensure that whatever the final arrangements are, they sustain the manufacturing renaissance we have seen in the West Midlands,” Street wrote in the Times.He said technology would be “part of the solution” but said trade flow was crucial. “If the technology doesn’t work for car parts at Dover or Felixstowe, if there are big delays, new checks or burdensome processes to claim back customs paid, costs will go up and companies will struggle,” he said. “If we get this wrong, we will see the unintended destruction of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry in the West Midlands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/030f7ee707922cab3a4e74f0713deca1b2c2c4de/0_452_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dcda2fa3a7af6739f10adc3d802ebdb","title":"unite and momentum back rival candidates in lewisham byelection","story":"Final selection hustings to choose Labour candidate expected to be a ‘real tough battle’ for the leftUnite and Momentum are expected to back rival candidates for the battle to become Lewisham East’s next Labour MP, the  has learned.Momentum’s national coordinating group is likely to back Lewisham councillor Sakina Sheikh, a former student campaigner who has close links with the grassroots group. Unite has already formally backed Islington councillor Claudia Webbe, a member of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) and a former adviser to Ken Livingstone.A Momentum source suggested the group wanted to back a candidate with local credentials. “The local Momentum heavily backs Sakina and it feels like she will get the national backing, as they are keen to make sure it’s a local candidate with the endorsement of local members,” the source said.However, Lewisham Momentum itself is split, with a recent AGM ending in a dispute. A Facebook post on the group’s account on Tuesday shared details of a campaign phone bank for Webbe.Unite announced on Tuesday it was backing Webbe, the more experienced candidate, saying she would be “a huge asset in parliament”. The trade union said Webbe was “a lifelong socialist who tirelessly fights the corner of working people, and for justice for those let down by our political system”.Two other candidates have also been shortlisted, councillor Brenda Dacres, who stood unsuccessfully to be Lewisham mayor earlier this year, and Janet Daby, Lewisham’s deputy mayor. Lewisham East’s local party is controlled by party centrists, who are likely to organise for Daby or Dacres. A Momentum source said the seat could be “a real tough battle” for the left in the local party.The final selection hustings for the seat, which has a 21,000 Labour majority, will take place on Saturday, when party members will vote for their preferred candidate to fight the by-election in June. The process was slowed down following an email campaign by grassroots party members who felt the initial timetable was too rushed.Ian McKenzie, the chair of Lewisham East CLP, said: “I’m absolutely delighted that the NEC has listened to local members and given us a say on who is on the shortlist, so members have a genuine choice. It looks like Jeremy Corbyn’s member-led democracy actually means something.”Two of the four shortlisted candidates, Daby and Dacres, were on a list published unilaterally by the local party, but which has no formal role in drawing up the shortlist.

While Cipriani has mustered only 14 caps after winning his first 10 years ago, his unwavering belief in his ability meant he could never close the chapter on England.Jones had overlooked him because he did not see Cipriani contentedly accepting a bit-part role. A player who had had training-ground disputes with the two previous England regimes was considered by some to be disruptive. After a Six Nations campaign in which the champions of the previous two seasons looked off the pace and lost their last three matches to finish fifth, Cipriani’s instinctive attacking flair counts for more than his reputation as a player who took some handling.“I have been here before and it’s not about following the wave up and down and letting your emotions ride with it but staying on an even keel,” Cipriani said before what will be his final game for Wasps on Saturday unless they defeat Saracens in the Premiership play-off at Allianz Park.“Anyone who knows me knows I’ve played the game just to play for England. It is now down to me to make sure things go well. I never gave up on England otherwise I would have signed a contract months ago.“I love the attritional side of French rugby and I had conversations. It was not easy to hold out with people pointing out that I was not getting picked but perhaps that wasn’t the right moment for me. When it is meant to be, it will all fall into place. It is tough to break into a squad with so much quality but I have an opportunity to go in and leave a positive imprint.”Cipriani will face his England tour captain in South Africa next month, Owen Farrell, when Wasps look to reach the final in consecutive seasons, although their league record against Saracens is poor – two victories in the past 13 meetings, both when Saracens fielded a weakened side.“Owen has stayed at the top of his game for a while,” Cipriani said. “He drives and runs the team and is the focal point of a Sarries attack that can cut teams apart. He has a huge amount of intensity and I am looking forward to working with him on the tour.”Cipriani has never been afraid to question authority and the first impression he makes on Jones, who from his first days with England has said he wants players to effectively make him redundant by being able to react to changing circumstances, will go a long way to determining whether he goes to the World Cup having missed out in 2011 and 2015.“As different challenges come about over the years, so mistakes happen. That gets viewed as such a negative thing: a kid makes a mistake and gets told off. You learn from mistakes it is how you improve. It is a message for people to understand: you won’t get to the top unless you make mistakes and I hope, after the ones I have made, I am the best version of myself right now and can keep improving.”Cipriani is leaving a club – as is the former Wasps captain James Haskell, who is a doubt for Saturday with a toe injury – who have not tried to rein him in. “Danny has been on fire in the last three months and was playing well before that,” said the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, who added there was no offer of a new contract because he could not wait until the end of the season for Cipriani to sort out his future. Gloucester looks the ideal refuge with their coach, Johan Ackermann, a believer in players backing their judgment.Cipriani was asked what his 18‑year‑old self would say to him now. “He would offer a high-five and say he would not have expected me to come through as I have. I feel lucky to be sitting here with a semi-final to play on Saturday and going on, I hope, to play for England again.”Saracens are likely to go into their home semi-final against Wasps boosted by the presence of Billy Vunipola. “We’re very hopeful Billy will be fine,” Mark McCall said. “Unless there’s a setback. He did everything we asked of him.”McCall would not be drawn on whether Vunipola would start on Saturday but with Schalk Burger and Callum Clark missing it seems likely. “He’s a great player. We’ve done without him for the whole year, so it’s a big boost for the team, and for Billy, to get on the park again – hopefully!”The Wales full-back Liam Williams is touch and go with a shoulder injury.

Not for the first time the England and Wales Cricket Board promised “fresh ideas” and Smith duly delivered some that were genuinely fresh, coherently explained and rationally justified, unlike one or two other membersemployees of the board in recent times.He was also remarkably relaxed in his new role. He can articulate with the best of them indeed he sounded rather like his recent Australian counterpart, John Inverarity, who first bounced Smith on his knee at Tonbridge almost 40 years ago. He was enthusiastic and accommodating.“That’s a good question”, he said several times to his former colleagues everything would be “terrific”. His was a polished debut in front of the press – he even managed to exit the room just as a question about The Hundred was being framed.Smith has broken with convention – though he kept stressing that “we” or “the selection panel” were responsible for the erting list of 12 names chosen for the Lord’s Test – by selecting someone who has not encountered a red ball this year. This is a risk. But it is not a ridiculous one. He has long admired Jos Buttler and there is no doubting the wicketkeeper batsman’s talent or temperament he knows and likes the grand occasion. But there is the problem that he has recently been programmed to hit every ball he receives for six or four, which he has been doing regularly for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.Buttler, while encouraged to play with freedom, will have to rediscover how to bat in a Test match – in a Test match at Lord’s. This is quite an undertaking but trusting in “a unique talent” and defying old truisms meets personal approval.Indeed Smith’s selections have brought a smile especially to the West Country. Even though the word “Lancashire” appears after the name of Buttler in the list, most of his fans in England reside west of Bristol, where he was born. Now having mourned the cruel injury to Jack Leach in the nets at Taunton on Monday, those fans can also celebrate the rapid elevation of Dom Bess out west.If this is not the case already, Bess might soon become the best off-spinner to come out of Blundell’s School in Tiverton and Somerset CCC for half a century or more. He has played only 16 first-class games, most of them on turning pitches at Taunton (or in Bridgetown, Barbados, where he took eight wickets for MCC in the match against Essex in March as well as hitting a century). Two or three years ago he was moving from Sidmouth CC in Devon to Exeter CC partly in search of more bowling opportunities. Now a Test match at Lord’s beckons – he is bound to play if the sun stays out.Bess was quick to commiserate with Leach, who has been a source of much sound advice for him over the last two years. In fact he is almost the polar opposite of Leach as a cricketer. Leach is a methodical man, who has improved by dint of much hard graft as a batsman and fielder as well as a bowler. Bess, who made his debut for Somerset in a two-day game against Pakistan in 2016, is more of an instinctive sportsman and a natural athlete. If the force is with him, things happen.He is a clean striker of the ball, who would bat above Stuart Broad in this team he will certainly raise the standard of England in the outfield, where he buzzes and is capable of the odd breathtaking moment. So far he has never seemed overawed, though Lord’s will represent the highest hurdle yet.In Somerset’s recent game against Hampshire at Taunton Bess struck a breezy 92 and propelled 41 overs, taking the solitary wicket of Rilee Rossouw in the first innings for 77 runs. He bowled with sound control, admittedly against batsmen set upon saving the game in the second innings when most of his deliveries were at James Vince, who may have produced the most mature innings of his career and certainly his longest (514 minutes). Bess has already shown he is not intimidated by bowling on a turning pitch (some spinners are) there is less evidence about how he fares on a flat one. However he is always up for the challenge and his debut will be an exciting moment, not just for those in Devon and Somerset.Indeed the announcement of this squad prompts a smile and a spring in the step it represents the most cheerful thing to come out of the ECB this summer. A month ago Smith was unlikely to be the man to provide fans with eager anticipation. This season your correspondent has occasionally railed against The Hundred and the plans for domestic cricket to no great effect. Now on consecutive days Colin Graves, albeit unwittingly, seems to have been more effective in providing reasons to reconsider the ECB’s ship of the game. Meanwhile Smith, trusting his gut rather than the data (though he is “interested in data”), has, by making two bold selections, invigorated the summer of 2018. The first Test should be fun for young and old alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12d924384b1fa300fc427e4851fdc4fabcc4a17e/17_116_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ec76015957f5e0b0346b83e6c5a26ce","title":"ireland moment sun setting test cricket malahide pakistan","story":"North Richmond Street, being blind, is a quiet street. There is nothing there to tell you what went on at No\u0026nbsp17, the red-brick terrace house where James Joyce lived as a kid. Round the back there is a courtyard garden, where Joyce spent happy hours batting against his brother John. “I remember having to bowl for him for perhaps an hour at a time,” John wrote. “I did so out of pure goodness of heart since, for my part, I\u0026nbsploathed the silly, tedious, inconclusive game.” James\u0026nbspwas a “useful bat” and “eagerly studied the feats of Ranji and Fry, Trumper and Spofforth”. Years later he threaded the four of them into the text of Finnegans\u0026nbspWake.It was the week for old stories about Irish cricketers. There is another about Samuel Beckett, half-true, about how, when he lived in Ussy-sur-Marne, he would drive the neighbour’s boy to school in his convertible. The kid was so big he could not fit in the bus seats. When he grew up they called him André the Giant. “I asked André what he and the famous author talked about when they were together,” wrote Cary Elwes. “‘Mostly cricket,’ André recalled.” Beckett opened the batting and bowling for Trinity College. He had a first-class batting average of 8.75 and, like Joyce, he never lost his taste for it.It is funny to think these great men had the same daydreams as the rest of us. Joyce and Beckett are two famous members of the small band of Irish Test match fans. In the 20th century this was a fruitless pursuit. For the past 140 years the only way an Irishman would play Test cricket was if he got picked for England. Leland Hone was the first to do it, in 1879. Hone, who kept wicket in the third-ever Test, was the first of seven Irishmen to play Tests for England. But there were many more, boys and men, who would have played for Ireland if they had had the chance.Men like Tom Ross, who took nine for 28 against South Africa, and Dougie Goodwin, who took five for six against West Indies in that famous game at Sion Mills in 1969. Men like Scott Huey, who topped Wisden’s first-class averages in 1954. In those days a bowler needed to take 10 wickets to qualify for Wisden’s list. Huey played only one first-class game all summer, against MCC, but he took 14 for 97. Men like Jimmy Boucher, who took 168 wickets in first-class cricket, at 14 each, seven of them for 13 runs against New Zealand.The inaugural Irish Test XI took to the field for the first time at Malahide last Saturday, at least a hundred years later than they might have done. “Tomorrow 11 of us will represent the 688 who have gone before us,” wrote Andy Balbirnie. “Thank you for paving the way for us to fulfil our dreams.”Malahide came as a sweet relief for an Englishman, upwind from Colin Graves’ Ratner-esque blather and the ECB’s steaming pile of “fresh tactical dimensions”. Graves, 70, was at it again on Monday, pontificating on the BBC about what the “younger generation” want. There was never a better reason to switch over to Guerilla Cricket, where it was broadcasting Kevin O’Brien’s fine innings, the first Test hundred for Ireland. It almost set up an improbable victory but in the end Ireland lost by five wickets. Which means Australia are still the only team to win their first Test.Except even in Ireland, where Test cricket was only just born, there was a whiff of something terminal about it. Over the weekend Brendon McCullum, the former New Zealand captain who did as much for the format as any other modern player, said in an interview: “I firmly believe Test cricket won’t be around in time, because there’s only so many teams that can afford to play it.”Ireland are not one of them. One could hear it in the words of their captain, William Porterfield, and chief executive, Warren Deutrom. “For most countries,” the latter said, “Test cricket, apart from England-Australia, which is the obvious exception, is a loss-leader.”Ireland are due to play only 16 Tests in the next five years. “It is going to be very hard to organise three- or five-game series with the cost that is involved. It would be great if we could play quite a few Tests a year but it is not financially viable as it stands,” Porterfield added. “That is what it is.”For all our romantic blarney about what Test cricket means to the Irish, Porterfield’s blunt truth is that the chance to play the game is just a bonus that came along with full membership of the ICC, which Ireland were finally granted last year. Full membership allows their administrators to plan not just for six to 12 months but three years down the line, to know what fixtures they are going to get and what funding they are going to get.“So that is probably the biggest thing it brings from Cricket Ireland’s point of view,” Porterfield said, “and Test cricket comes along with that and we are fortunate enough to get that opportunity. But, to be honest, T20 probably has taken over.”One could see that in the scaffolding grandstands. Cricket Ireland had set up only 6,000 seats and it did not fill them. When Ireland play two T20s against India this summer, the capacity will be increased to 8,000. Outside England and Australia Test cricket is a heritage business. The Irish may as well have discovered a sudden enthusiasm for steam trains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de80ae67a91bddbbcde4909ec05cd482e93d663/0_133_5420_3252/master/5420.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c996177679957798607a8e45b76d3bf6","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook plans uk evidence mps parliament","story":"MPs inquiring into Cambridge Analytica breach urge Facebook CEO to appear via video linkFacebook has said Mark Zuckerberg has no plans to come to the UK to give evidence to parliament despite the threat of a formal summons, prompting frustrated MPs inquiring into the Cambridge Analytica data breach to ask if he would appear via video link instead.The social network said it recognised “the seriousness of these issues” and provided written answers to 39 questions posed by the MPs, who had argued that the oral evidence of the chief technology officer sent in lieu of Zuckerberg last month was insufficient.Damian Collins, the Conservative chair of the digital culture media and sport select committee, said: “If Mark Zuckerberg truly recognises the ‘seriousness’ of these issues as they say they do, we would have expected that he would want to appear.“Although Facebook says Mr Zuckerberg has no plans to travel to the UK, we would also be open to taking his evidence by video link, if that would be the only way to do this.”The MPs intend to maintain the threat of issuing a formal summons to Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, while they hope he can be persuaded to appear. They also indicated they would study the company’s response to their questions as they weighed up what to do next.Select committees rarely formally summon witnesses to appear, but the move has been successful in persuading another US-based chief executive to give evidence in the past.Rupert Murdoch and his son James were formally summoned by the same committee in the summer of 2011, after the two men had initially indicated they would not answer questions about phone hacking at the News of the World. Once the committee issued a formal summons, the duo relented, and chose to appear.However, in practice, the committee has no power to force a person to give evidence if they are based abroad, as Zuckerberg is. It is theoretically up to the Commons to decide what sanction if a person breaches the summons, although historical powers to jail and fine have long considered to be in abeyance.Facebook’s 18-page letter states that the first Zuckerberg knew about allegations that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted data harvested from Facebook users was in March 2018 “when these issues were raised in the media” by the  and other publications.Last month Facebook sent its chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer to give evidence before the select committee. He was rebuked by Ian Lucas, a Labour member, who complained that he could not spell out what Zuckerberg knew and when and whether previous testimony given by the company relating to the data breach in February was accurate.Facebook also said that it had found that Aggregate IQ, a little known Canadian technology firm, spent $1.6m on Facebook adverts on behalf of Vote Leave, and a further $329,000 with BeLeave, a youth campaign that Vote Leave is alleged to have colluded with. A further $51,500 was spent with Veterans for Britain, another pro-Brexit group and $32,700 with the DUP’s Vote to Leave campaign.Aggregate IQ, which has been effectively described as the Canadian arm of Cambridge Analytica’s parent SCL Group, is due to give evidence on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29bec3ffd2ff6f501db2188693666cd10b77687/0_96_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1af0196487326f55da43cf02c7d02960","title":"the windsors royal wedding special review gloriously brazen satire","story":"Bert Tyler-Moore and George Jeffrie’s ruthless comedy is a reminder that you can get away with a lot as long as you are funny“Yes!” shouts Meghan Markle. “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!” Not in a When Harry Met Sally way, but in a Harry met Meghan and finally got around to proposing way (Channel 4).

The language could not be clearer. Moreno has made it plain that the world’s most famous lodger has overstayed his welcome in Ecuador’s London embassy.Nearly six years ago, it was a different story. When Ecuador granted Assange political asylum on 16 August 2012, the country’s then foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, said Ecuador believed the WikiLeaks founder’s fear of persecution was legitimate and praised “his dedicated defence of freedom of expression” in a speech in Quito.But what was expected to be a stopover turned into a lengthy sojourn and Assange became one of the world’s most high-profile fugitives. During the past six years, he has refused to step out of the embassy building, fearing he would be arrested by British police and extradited to the US for questioning over WikiLeaks’ activities. Assange’s behaviour has not endeared him to his hosts. For instance, his tweets in favour of Catalan independence are said to have annoyed the Spanish government, souring relations between Madrid and Quito. The publication by WikiLeaks of emails connected to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election may be another reason why Ecuador’s foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa, said at the start of this year that Assange’s continued stay was “unsustainable”.Moreno has been seeking to build bridges with the US, restoring trade ties that were damaged in recent years. Ecuador seems to be hoping that Assange’s already uncomfortable confinement will become intolerable.It is hard to see how Assange can leave the embassy and not end up being arrested for breach of bail, which could lead to him being imprisoned.Ecuador has explored a number of other ideas, none of which seems feasible. In January, its foreign ministry said Assange had been made an Ecuadorian citizen in an attempt to resolve the impasse over his continued stay at the embassy. The UK Foreign Office responded by saying: “Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice.”Espinosa is one of two candidates campaigning to be elected the 73rd president of the UN general assembly next month. Some in Ecuador have speculated that she might appoint Assange as Ecuador’s United Nations representative, in order to get him UN diplomatic status so he can leave the UK. However, the foreign ministry has said if Espinosa is elected, she would not be responsible for Assange’s case.Intelligence service documents seen by the  suggest the UN idea has previously been considered. Assange’s nomination as Ecuador’s representative to the UN would afford him diplomatic immunity while travelling to UN meetings around the world, one document said. It also suggested trying to smuggle him out in a diplomatic vehicle, but accepted the fact that to do so he would have to leave the embassy, and risk being detained, before getting into the car. British police ended a costly 24-hour guard of the embassy in October 2015, but the building remains under covert surveillance.Rafael Correa: president of Ecuador from 2007 to 2017Correa came to power in 2007 at the tail end of the “pink tide” that swept through Latin America, ushering in leftist leaders such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia. Correa styled himself as an anti-imperialist, shunning what was regarded as US interference in the region.He won three elections and changed the constitution while courting, at the peak of his powers, the highest approval rating of any leader in the country’s history.The US-trained economist faced criticism when he announced in 2008 that Ecuador was officially defaulting on billions of dollars of foreign debt, forcing the country to seek unfavourable loans, particularly from China.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.But it was Correa’s authoritarian style and constant attacks against the press that drew more international opprobrium. He brought in a communications law that obliged media outlets to carry government messages, and used his weekly TV shows to personally attack journalists, often tearing up newspapers.Correa came to wider international attention after offering asylum to Assange in 2012. He left behind a wealthier and fairer country, but a more ided one.Lenín Moreno: president of EcuadorMoreno narrowly won the 2017 election as Correa’s successor and the candidate for his Alianza País party. Some dismissed Moreno as a puppet of his domineering predecessor, but he soon proved to be his own man.Moreno, the world’s only head of state to use a wheelchair, made good on a pledge to tackle graft by sacking the former vice-president Jorge Glas, a close ally of Correa, with Glas later sentenced to six years in jail for corruption.He criticised Correa for mismanaging the economy and leaving the country saddled with debt, mostly to China.The result is a bitter feud between former allies. Moreno, who served as Correa’s vice-president from 2007 to 2013, has repeatedly hinted that he wants to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.He has also stressed that his respect for press freedom is one of his key differences with his predecessor.Moreno has a fondness for singing in public and making jokes.

He rang the bell, walked in and asked for political asylum.It was Julian Assange. Days earlier, he had lost his long legal fight against extradition to Sweden, where two women accused him of rape.Soon afterwards, the left-leaning then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, agreed to Assange’s request, precipitating a major diplomatic row with the British government. And a full-blown siege. politan police officers swarmed outside the building, ready to arrest Assange should he venture out.It was against this febrile backdrop that Correa authorised a secret programme named “Operation Guest”. It was later renamed “Operation Hotel”. The guest was Assange, politely referred to as el huésped.The goal, at first, was to stop detectives bursting into the modest ground-floor embassy and dragging Assange away. But documents seen by the  show it developed into something more complex. The aim seems to have changed from protecting Assange – which propped up WikiLeaks in the process – to spying on him.Whatever its aims, WikiLeaks was able to keep going up to and beyond its role in the 2016 US presidential election, with all the seismic consequences. It was WikiLeaks that published hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and senior Democratic officials, leading to claims that it was part of an alleged Kremlin plot to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.How WikiLeaks got the emails in the first place is an enduring mystery.Did someone drop them off to Assange on a flash drive? Were the files uploaded on to an encrypted remote server? Or did they come in by some other route?Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election, is looking for the answer. The secret records seen by the  and the magazine Focus Ecuador may give him important new clues.According to the documents, the counter-espionage effort began nearly six years ago when a team secretly installed CCTV cameras in the Ecuadorian embassy. They covered the entrance lobby, a meeting room and the mini-balcony from which Assange would periodically address supporters. The agents filmed everyone who came in and out, and kept watch on the street.Security personnel worked two-person shifts and were on duty 24 hours a day. They do not appear to have recorded Assange’s conversations, documents suggest. However, they were able to observe him closeup, noting his moods, habits and sleeping patterns.Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since August 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.None of this came cheap.The documents set out how Ecuador’s intelligence agency, known as Senain, hired an international security company. Its bill in 2012 was $55,000 (£40,000) a month, paid from a “special expenses” government budget.They detail how the company’s agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy, in a multi-tenant Edwardian mansion block in Basil Street. Unbeknown to Ecuadorian taxpayers, the operatives were camping out in one of the most expensive parts of London, albeit in a basic basement flat with two bedrooms, which cost £2,800 a month.From a control room, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. They consulted with him about anyone wanting to visit. If he agreed, guests were allowed in. They were met in the foyer, went through a security check, and handed over their passports and mobile phones.The documents show that operatives wrote down passport numbers, nationalities and the purposes of the visits. These included “social reunion”, “medical”, “legal” or “VIP”. They clocked when the guest arrived and when they exited, in the early months past a phalanx of armed police waiting in uniform on the embassy’s front steps. At the beginning of the crisis, when the small Andean nation was facing off against the might of the British state, officers lurked on the interior stairs and next to the embassy toilet. Every month, the security company sent a confidential list of Assange’s visitors to the Ecuadorian president. There were additional “extraordinary” reports. Sometimes, the company included stills from secret video footage of interesting guests, plus profiles and analysis. They also reported when a packet of sweets was lobbed on to the balcony, seemingly a present for Assange. It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood.Assange has refused to say how the emails got to WikiLeaks. He denies they came from a “state actor”. The FBI does not appear to believe him. Giving evidence last year, the agency’s then director, James Comey, told Congress that Moscow was behind the DNC cyber-raid. An “intermediary”, he said, passed the emails to WikiLeaks.Assange’s relationship with Moscow is certainly longstanding. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Kremlin-owned television network RT. The Julian Assange Show featured 10 guests, including Correa. Weeks after Assange’s interview with Correa was broadcast, the Australian sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy.The logs record that Assange had more than 80 visitors in one month in 2016. They included the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison and longtime supporters such as Craig Murray, the UK’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Another was the Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat.There were also visits from Assange’s lawyer Gareth Peirce and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, who hosted WikiLeaks at his Norfolk mansion for 13 months up until Assange jumped bail. On 23 June 2016, RT broadcast a referendum special from inside the embassy, with the final guests leaving at 4.30am.The external surveillance team wrote up descriptions of these encounters. They were sent back to Senain and Correa, sources say. The then Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, visited Assange in London, talking with him into the early hours, and criticised Britain for failing to find a solution to the standoff. The UK was unmoved. Asked what the government planned to do about Assange, the then foreign minister, Hugo Swire, said: “Not my stone, not my shoe.”Correa had no immediate comment on the operation. He has previously decried the UK’s attempts to arrest Assange, saying his country would not tolerate “colonialism of any kind”. Meanwhile, leaked invoices show the Ecuadorian government spent as much as $28m on surveillance equipment, sold only to states. What it was used for and by whom is unclear.By 2014, it appears tensions over Assange were growing. The documents reveal that Ecuador’s then ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconí Puig, forwarded a complaint to Senain after a bill arrived for unpaid council tax from Kensington and Chelsea. The tax was payable on the agents’ clandestine flat in Basil Mansions. Falconí had no idea it existed. He rang Patiño, demanding to know what was going on, according to sources in Quito.That autumn, the security consultants reported that Assange had somehow set up his own secret communications network. Moreover, they said he had “violated” the embassy’s computers and was apparently reading confidential diplomatic traffic, the company reported. Embassy staff apparently kept their personal files on Assange in a safe – the one place he could not access.The head of Ecuadorian intelligence, Rommy Vallejo, held a meeting with Patiño to discuss the Assange situation and the “risks” he posed to embassy staff. Over time, Assange came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space. Initially, he slept in narrow room next to the balcony. He subsequently colonised a back room as a bedroom and occupied half the kitchen. Assange’s unkempt realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and was entirely private. There was no CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, the rooms only accessible via special codes.Patiño brushed off these concerns. His solution to this internal takeover was to dispatch three undercover intelligence officers from Quito to increase security, documents show. The Assange bill was already causing friction with Ecuador’s financial chief. The new state agents cost an extra $35,000 a month, paid out on top of the security company’s monthly invoice, which had climbed to $97,000.Documents show the private security team’s duties included keeping an eye on Hans Crescent, the street outside the embassy. It reported demonstrations in support of Assange, noting that they became smaller each year. There was a strange visit by an American superfan who spent two days outside the embassy sleeping in a car. Protesters who took part in an anti-Correa demonstration were surreptitiously photographed. One one occasion, the team sent back images of a young man in a suit whom they deemed suspicious. Much of their job involved monitoring British police officers stationed outside. Scotland Yard later scaled back its presence outside the embassy and withdrew officers altogether in 2017, when Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences, which Assange has always denied.In November 2017, the team filed an “extraordinary” 10-page report on a visit by two Catalan separatists, Oriol Soler and Andreu Grinyó. The meeting might “trigger criticism” from Madrid if it leaked, they concluded. Assange tweeted that same day in support of Catalan secession.Over time, Ecuador’s counter-espionage operation became mundane. In January, the agents noted that a new cleaner had started work. Typically, Assange would hold private conversations in the women’s bathroom, they wrote in a daily log. Visitors noticed that he used a “squelch box”, a counter-surveillance device that emitted a loud sound.Letters arrived for him, as did flowers, the agents noted. The flowers were thrown away “according to protocol”. Sometimes, Assange smoked a pipe. His mood was generally placid. On occasion, there were angry eruptions, sympathetically interpreted by the agents who could understand his frustration after being in the embassy for such a long time. The agents faithfully recorded visits from Bolivia’s former foreign minister, as well as such high-profile guests as Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. Early this year, Assange’s most frequent visitor was the legal analyst Stella Morris, a member of his legal team.Journalists and film-makers have been frequent guests. They included the ’s Ewen MacAskill, who visited twice in January and February to discuss Assange’s confinement and his prospects for the future.In February, there were no more visits recorded for two weeks. This barren spell was marked across a line as “sin visitas”.Friends conceded that after almost six years in the embassy, Assange was visibly suffering, and in poor health, although they described him as mentally robust. At weekends, embassy staff go home, leaving him with no one to talk to apart from a solitary guard.The logs do not explain how WikiLeaks received the 70,000 Democratic emails that had been hacked.By the spring of this year, developments in Quito had moved in an ominous direction for Assange. Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, pronounced him a costly “inherited problem” and made it clear that he viewed Assange as an obstacle to better relations with the US.As a candidate, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks when it revealed embarrassing Democratic party secrets. When Assange released the email correspondence of the Clinton aide John Podesta, Trump exclaimed: “I love WikiLeaks.” Before and after the election, Donald Trump Jr exchanged a handful of direct Twitter messages with Assange.Seemingly, the Trump White House changed its view when Wikileaks dumped out classified CIA hacking tools. The agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo, who was later made secretary of state, dubbed WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service”.In March, Assange’s internet access was cut off. A jammer was installed to prevent him from accessing emails. For more than a month, he has been forbidden visitors. Friends say he is passing the time by reading. They say he is leafing through books on the US election, which WikiLeaks did so much to influence and – its critics allege – subvert. Meanwhile, Correa, Assange’s protector and patron, has moved to Belgium. He has since landed at job at RT.Last week, the embassy appeared deserted. Nearby, well-heeled passengers emerged from Bentleys and Mercedes outside Harrods. Six supporters held banners that said “Free Assange” and #ReconnectJulian. A violinist serenaded him from the pavement. There was no sign of the guest, but the window next to his balcony was open.Assange faces a tough choice. If he walks out of the embassy, he can expect arrest and could spend up to a year in prison for breaking his bail conditions.The US might then seek to extradite him. He would contest any attempt, and might win, but would face a long, uncomfortable spell behind bars while his case is decided.Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next. Russia would be an obvious choice, though this would cause problems with the US. Cuba and Venezuela are also said to be under discussion. Since January, Assange has officially been an Ecuadorian diplomat. However, this probably would not stop the UK arresting him if it had the chance.If Assange remains in the embassy, cut off from the world, WikiLeaks cannot function. Either way, it is clear that Ecuador no longer wants him. His future is more uncertain than ever. The most likely scenario is that he will soon walk out the door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebbc41483d62ad128d77f7f602c30cd4c3132d3/199_46_1552_931/master/1552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e052de32061d3ab9883b4b20cf27bcfc","title":"uk government block release files gaddafi libya abdel hakim belhaj","story":"Lawyers to call for FoI request to be rejected days after apology for Abdel Hakim Belhaj renditionGovernment lawyers are attempting to prevent documents that detail the relationship between the British government and Muammar Gaddafi from being made public under the Freedom of Information Act, just days after apologising for the UK’s role in the kidnap and torture of one of the Libyan dictator’s opponents.They are appealing against an information tribunal ruling that the documents should be handed to Nigel Ashton, professor of international history at the London School of Economics.At a hearing in London on Wednesday, lawyers for the Cabinet Office will argue that Ashton’s request should be dismissed as being “vexatious” because of the amount of time it would take to redact the papers before release, on such grounds as national security and the safeguarding of international relations.At a hearing last year, the information tribunal ruled that Ashton had made a request for “information which is of great public value and significance”, and that as a consequence the clause in the act that deals with vexatious requests – those that are manifestly unjustified – could not be invoked.Ashton initially requested copies of Downing Street files that covered the period from the Lockerbie bombing of December 1988 to the revolution of 2011 that resulted in Gaddafi being deposed and murdered. He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002, but has said he may request more.Last week Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the leader of an Islamist militia that had been opposed to Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, that she was “profoundly sorry” about the role MI6 played in their kidnap, rendition and torture in 2004. The government paid Boudchar £500,000. Throughout his six-year legal battle, Behaj insisted he wanted only an apology, and he received no payment. In return, the couple dropped their civil claim against MI6 and the Foreign Office, and against Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, who were foreign secretary and head of counter-terrorism at MI6 at the time of the couple’s kidnap. The couple’s lawyers also withdrew their attempt to seek a judicial review of the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision not to charge Allen with criminal offences after a four-year Scotland Yard investigation.The couple had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and detained by the CIA after a tipoff from MI6. They were put on a flight to Tripoli, where Belhaj was imprisoned for six years and frequently tortured. Boudchar was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight. She was four and a half months pregnant at the time.Four weeks later, a second leading opponent of Gaddafi was kidnapped in Hong Kong after an MI6 tipoff and flown to Tripoli with his wife and four children. He settled his claim against the British government in 2012, receiving £2.2m. Documents discovered in government offices in Tripoli during the Libyan revolution show the kidnap operations followed lengthy MI6 surveillance of the two men.Papers recovered at the same time show that information subsequently extracted under torture from the two men was used to justify the detention and attempted deportation of a number of Libyans living in Britain.There were also papers that detailed the way in which Gaddafi’s intelligence officers were invited to Britain, where they allegedly threatened Libyan asylum seekers and British-Libyan nationals, in the presence of MI5 officers. Asked whether it was resisting Ashton’s request because it did not wish to see further evidence of unlawful and politically embarrassing activities coming to light, the Cabinet Office declined to comment.Ashton submitted his request for information in 2014 and hopes ultimately to achieve a greater understanding of the role the British government played in creating Libya as it is today.This would include examining British responses to the Lockerbie bombing and Gaddafi’s support for the IRA the period of rapprochement during which the rendition plots were hatched and the UK’s role in supporting the insurgency that eventually toppled the Gaddafi regime.“The public interest in understanding Britain’s policy towards Libya is overwhelming,” Ashton said. “It seems extraordinary that the Cabinet Office has resisted my freedom of information request at every turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c458b35223a9139d55120f869df128c21efc14d/300_627_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07b67d5d3ac846ae409e276f152568bf","title":"70th anniversary palestine nakba day in pictures","story":"Palestinians have been marking Nakba Day, which is generally commemorated on 15 May to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.

It took the lifeboat crew seven hours to secure it and bring it safely to Ballyglass, Co Mayo.On arriving on scene, they saw the steel barge measuring 26m by 16m which was “unsecured and floating”. They were informed by the coastguard that the structure had broken free from its moorings in Canada, more than 3,080km away, last November before being sighted locally that evening.The lifeboat crew established a tow and brought the barge back to Ballyglass harbour. However, there was no room to berth it safely so it was put on the lifeboat mooring before a more permanent solution could be found. The crew were not stood down until 2am on Tuesday morning.Allen Murray, one of the crew, said the craft could have caused huge damage to another vessel had it come into contact with it.“We’ve never come across anything like it before,” he said. “It was a very unusual one for us. If another boat had hit it, there wouldn’t be much left of it, put it that way.“We had difficulty coming up alongside it. There was a 2m swell and a lot of water, so it was far from ideal conditions.”Ballyglass RNLI lifeboat operations manager Padraic Sheeran said the team was “not expecting this type of callout at all”.“You do hear of vessels and craft breaking free of moorings but it’s unusual to have one drift thousands of kilometres and have to be rescued by lifeboat,” he said.“On a serious note though, it represented a major navigational danger to any vessel that it collided with and it was a relief to have it safely recovered.”"},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496700.1526417008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish unity polarised response to may comment on border poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComments attributed to British prime minister Theresa May’s about a Border poll are an admission that a referendum on Irish unity should be called, Sinn Féin has said. Photograph: Simon DawsonPoolEPA..Comments attributed to British prime minister Theresa May’s about a Border poll are an admission that it is time for a referendum on Irish unity, Sinn Féin has said. The Times on Tuesday reported an exchange between Ms May and Tory back bencher Jacob Rees-Mogg at a party meeting. A source was quoted as saying Mr Rees-Mogg told those at the meeting he was in no doubt Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK in the event of a Border poll. According to the source, Ms May replied: “I would not be as confident as you. That’s not a risk I’m prepared to take. We cannot be confident on the politics of that situation, on how it plays out.” The Belfast Agreement says the Northern secretary shall exercise the power to direct the holding of a Border poll “if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said if the reports were accurate, Ms May was “conceding that the Good Friday Agreement threshold for triggering a unity poll has been met”. Ms O’Neill also said it was “entirely unacceptable” that Ms May had reportedly indicated that she intends to actively prevent that from happening. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP said “this story is based on speculation” and the union is “clearly best for everyone living, working or raising a family in Northern Ireland”. He said Sinn Féin routinely failed to make a convincing arguments about removing Northern Ireland from the union and that a Border poll would be “isive and not helpful in building a shared society”. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was “committed to delivering a new inclusive Ireland but recognises that there remains a body of work to be done to persuade unionism”. Mr Eastwood also said Ms May’s comments reflect the changing constitutional landscape facing these islands in the wake of Brexit. Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said “the union is secure and will grow stronger”. “I am absolutely confident that the case for the union would carry the day comfortably in any border poll,” he said. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said while his party respects everyone’s constitutional aspiration, “the priority today must be to agree a special deal for Northern Ireland to mitigate the risks from Brexit and to achieve the maximum cross-community support for such a pragmatic way forward”. Green Party leader Steven Agnew said all parties should “be focused on getting our devolved institutions back up and running so that we can tackle the crises in health and education”.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA flying column of angels arrived at the gates of Leinster House just in time for Leaders’ Questions.They stayed outside. The Dáil is no place for angels, even if some of the politicians who inhabit it could give them lessons in how to dance on a pin.Large of feathery wing, they marched whiteously up Kildare Street and flapped into position near the wide pavement’s edge. The women formed a third line of silent protest in front of a back row of hugely magnified and luridly enhanced images of foetal remains. It was a strange scene.Representatives of a Tipperary-based group called the Irish Centre for Bioethical Reform (ICBR) – an offshoot of an American anti-abortion organisation – had lined up against the railings and put these giant banners on display.In front of them two young men held up a large rainbow flag, partially obscuring one graphic image. Two more beside them were shaking out what looked like a bedspread in advance of lifting it into position. Members of the Students Union of Ireland had hoisted a long banner in front of another blown-up print. Some Sinn Féin staffers came out and held up the letters Y-E-S, further eclipsing the repellent displays.And ahead of them stood the young women with the angel wings, wearing red “Repeal” hearts over their own hearts, further distracting from what was going on along the back wall.There has been a cat and mouse game around Dublin city in the past few weeks between the ICBR silent protesters and a stalking group of similarly silent protesters dedicated to blocking the abortion images they have been hawking around places like maternity hospital entrances.Back outside Leinster House, the anti-abortion campaigners also produced two smaller posters in an effort to thwart their determined adversaries. They started screwing aluminium rods together, like they were going to assemble a gazebo, until they had poles long enough to shove their bloodied images higher than everything else.“If this wasn’t so awful, it’d be very funny,” remarked one onlooker.What with the hoisting activities, the horrible images, the camouflaging efforts, the rosary beads women on the periphery, the earlier arrival of an amiable group of Grandfathers for Yes and the later turnout of angels, the photographers and TV camera people were delighted.Just over a week to go now to polling day. As TDs entered their penultimate week in the Dáil before the vote you could sense the atmosphere becoming a little more strained, emotions a little more heightened.There was much talk around the corridors about the previous night’s referendum debate on Claire Byrne Live, the conduct of which dismayed quite a few proponents of a Yes vote, who felt the anti-abortion panellists, with the help of very vocal and passionate supporters in the audience, had steamrollered their pro-choice opposition with a combination of confident answers and a crushingly combative style.On the other side – and the Dáil has a very substantial number of TDs who do not support repeal – there seemed a definite change of mood. They had a pep in their step and radiated a quiet satisfaction.\u0026nbspOne of the main reasons the repealers were feeling sore was because they felt obstetrician Prof Peter Boylan was “taken out” of Monday night’s debate by what they perceived to be a concerted onslaught of criticism and contradiction from the anti-abortion side.On the other hand, Independent TD Mattie McGrath, a leading light of that campaign, was not letting up on the charge started on television the night before. He also zoned in on the what he called inaccurate claims by medical experts, referencing a call by a number of doctors in the SouthSouthwest Hospital Group for Prof Boylan to step aside from his position as chairman of the Institution of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.He said that for the past two weeks two of the country’s senior medical professionals have been “endlessly repeating dangerous and reckless comments” in the referendum debate but “the Taoiseach will not stand up to them because they support his view in the upcoming referendum”.For his part, Leo Varadkar said he had hoped the debate would not become personalised, and until now it had remained largely respectful.“I deeply regret that some people have now chosen to try to personalise the campaign in regard to Dr Peter Boylan. Dr Boylan has the right to his view, just as doctors or former judges on the No side have the right to their view.”McGrath took umbrage at “a grossly offensive” remark by the Taoiseach last week where he said people who oppose repealing the Eighth Amendment were “turning a cold shoulder” to victims of sexual violence. This, he declared, was untrue and unfair.Varadkar noted how McGrath raised the issue of care and compassion, saying he had yet to hear from anyone, including the aforementioned Deputy, about how they care for and show compassion for the victims of sexual violence he had just mentioned.Victims “such as a 13-, 14- or 15-year-old girl who may have been raped by her father, grandfather or uncle, and is bleeding and in pain. What answer does the Deputy offer her?”The independent TD for Tipperary didn’t really have one.“You have no right to lecture us. We have compassion. Many organisations and agencies which I support assist victims of sexual violence on an hourly basis. We want more compassion, not the taking away of the last vestige of support for the unborn child – not a foetus – in the womb. We wish to maintain life from conception to end of life.”But they don’t want her to have the choice to end that pregnancy.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496696.1526416638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea cancels talks with south putting us summit in doubt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un shakes hands with South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in at the military demarcation line that ides their countries last month.  Photograph: Korea Summit Press PoolAFPGetty ImagesNorth Korea has abruptly cancelled high-level talks with South Korea scheduled for Wednesday and placed a doubt over next month’s planned summit in Singapore between its leader Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump. Delegations from North and South had been due to meet on Wednesday in the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone separating the two countries. But North Korea’s Central News said Pyongyang had no choice but to suspend the talks, calling ongoing US-South Korean military exercises a “provocation”. In an ominous sign for the upcoming meeting between Mr Trump and his one-time foe Mr Kim, South Korea’s main news agency reported that North Korea had also threatened to cancel the June 12th summit with the US. The US “will have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities,” South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted North Korea as saying. Addressing reporters shortly after the announcement, the spokeswoman for the US State Department said it had received no information from North Korea about plans to cancel the summit. “Kim Jong-un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises,” Heather Nauert said, noting that the exercises were legal and planned well in advance. “We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between president Trump and Kim Jong-un.”The surprise cancellation of Wednesday’s meeting came less than 24 hours after Pyongyang had convened the talks, which aimed to build on the progress of the historic April 27th summit between Mr Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. Delegations from North Korea and South Korea had been expected to travel to the demilitarised zone. The development comes after a period of unprecedented engagement between the US and North Korea. Last week, three US detainees who had been imprisoned in North Korea were released and secretary of state Mike Pompeo made his second visit to the North Korean capital in six weeks in preparation for next month’s summit. Satellite images appear to show that North Korea has begun closing its nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri. The foreign ministry said that it would invite journalists to witness the closing later this month.The so-called “Max Thunder” military drills are an aircraft-only series of drills conducted annually by US and South Korean forces, involving about 1,500 military personnel. About 23,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea and regularly partake in military drills with South Korean troops.Mr Trump has staked his foreign policy reputation on the forthcoming summit with North Korea, welcoming the apparent thaw in relations between the two countries. Mr Pompeo said over the weekend that the US would provide economic investment to North Korea if the country signed up to denuclearisation, though he stressed that this would involve “complete verifiable irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495798.1526376817!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea dismantling nuclear test site satellite imagery shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t North Korean leader Kim Jong-un discussing a nuclear weapons programme with officials  in a photograph released in  September 2017.  Photograph: KCNA via Reuters North Korea has already made considerable progress in dismantling its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri as promised, according to a report on the 38 North website that closely monitors activities in the North.“After initial reporting of plans to allow experts and media personnel to observe the closing of North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site . . . commercial satellite imagery from May 7th provided the first definitive evidence that dismantlement of the test site was already well under way,” the website said.Last month, North Korea said it would shut its nuclear test site and halt nuclear weapons testing and missile launches ahead of a planned meeting on June 12th between Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump. The 38 North website is one of the most respected monitors on North Korea. It is a programme of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).The government said it would allow foreign journalists into North Korea next week to witness the dismantling of the facility.The safety of the Punggye-ri site has been a subject of concern and there had been reports that some areas of the test site have become unstable after the last nuclear test in September.The website said several key operational support buildings in the site had been razed since the last time it performed an analysis of the site.“Some of the rails for the mining carts, which had led from the tunnels to their respective spoil piles, have apparently been removed. Additionally, some carts seem to have been tipped over andor disassembled, and several small shedsoutbuildings around the site had been removed,” 38 North said.Other buildings remain intact, and the tunnel entrances appear to remain open ahead of the final ceremony next week, it said.The final closure ceremony would involve the “collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts”.The Koreas are due to hold high-level talks in the peace village of Panmunjom on the southern side of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) iding them on Wednesday.The North will send a 29-member delegation for the discussions, led by Ri Son-kwon, who chairs the North’s reunification agency.Also in the delegation will be Kim Yun-hyok, vice railroad minister, and Won Kil-u, vice sports minister, along with journalists.The delegation from the South will be lead by unification minister Cho Myoung-gyon. The delegation be composed of about five officials, but the final list has yet to be determined.It’s the first time that senior officials from both Koreas will face each other since the April 27th summit between South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim.Separately, Japanese media reported that senior level officials from the ruling Workers Party of North Korea had visited Beijing. As North Korea’s only major ally, China is keen to maintain a high-profile role in the efforts to secure peace in the region and make sure the US does not use the opportunity to leverage greater influence."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496590.1526411397!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boris brexit and the border continue to cause strife","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDuring a meeting with Conservative backbenchers on Monday, Theresa May is reported to have slapped down Jacob Rees-Mogg. Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry teased Boris Johnson over his role in the cabinet’s split over Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU.“May I begin by thanking the foreign secretary for leading our cross-party efforts over the last two weeks to destroy the prime minister’s ‘customs partnership’ proposal? I trust that he finished off the job earlier this morning. Unfortunately, however, that leaves us with his own crazy Mad Max – I mean max fac – proposal,” she said.Johnson responded by describing Labour’s position on the customs union as “absolutely clouded in obscurity”. But there is no obscuring the tangle Theresa May has found herself in as she seeks to unite her party behind a single position which can be reconciled with her promise to avoid a hard border in Ireland. During a meeting with Conservative backbenchers on Monday, May is reported to have slapped down Jacob Rees-Mogg after the arch-Brexiteer suggested that Britain should simply keep the Border open after Brexit and dare Dublin to install infrastructure at the EU’s behest. May told him that EU rules obliged Ireland to protect the single market and customs area and warned that his approach could antagonise moderate nationalist opinion in Northern Ireland.If Rees-Mogg was chastened, he showed no sign of it in an opinion piece in Tuesday’s Daily  in which he urged the prime minister not to take Brussels too seriously on the Border. He accused Brussels of playing up the issue to win further concessions from Britain and complained that Irish politicians such as Simon Coveney were using “inflammatory, unhelpful rhetoric” for domestic political reasons.“The Irish Government needs to understand that if it obliges us to choose between the Republic and the Union, we will choose the Union,” he wrote.May has tasked two groups of ministers to work out how each of the two customs options could be made to work. Brexiteers have until now shown no sign of weakening in their resistance to the customs partnership and the talk around Westminster is of “max fac plus delay”. This would see Britain remaining in the customs union beyond the end of the post-Brexit transition period at the end of 2020 until the arrangements are in place at its borders to make trade sufficiently frictionless.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495097.1526324307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"janan ganesh leavers prepare their brexit betrayal narrative","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg: his use of “cretinous”, along with Boris Johnson’s “crazy”, to describe Theresa May’s customs partnership ideas suggests the histrionics of ham actors. Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor. Leavers demand everything from a Brexit deal except their names on the paper. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markles wedding cake royal bakes ages","story":"Meghan and Harry have chosen their wedding cake, and it is to be a celebration of spring a zingy, floral confection with firm nods to all of the current fashionable food preoccupations - seasonality, provenance and natural ingredients.

New or expensive treatments are not necessarily better  Personal experiences or anecdotes are not a reliable way to judge whether something works  Treatments can be both harmful and beneficial at the same time  Just because a treatment is popular, it doesn’t mean it’s the best Dr Oxman has spent his career trying to encourage people to think critically about health but decided to switch his focus to children in an attempt to catch them before they start learning bad habits.He tested his theories in primary schools in Uganda, not because Ugandans are more likely to believe bogus health claims but “because the fewer resources you have the more important it is not to waste them,” he says.Researchers worked with staff and pupils in Ugandan primary schools to teach children the fundamentals of critical thinking around health claimsWorking with teachers and children in Ugandan primary schools he and a team of researchers came up with a list of key concepts, an algorithm for scoring them and various teaching materials, including a comic book-style textbook which would teach children the fundamentals of critical thinking around health claims.The full package is available to parents and teachers online.The book uses local beliefs as a basis for debunking myths.Allen Nsangi, a researcher at Makerere University College of Health Sciences in Uganda, worked with the children on the design and content of the book and trained teachers to deliver the lessons..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}I would love to see the whole world thinking critically – we really need this in the age of fake newsDr Andy Oxman, director of the Centre for Informed Health Choices“You could tell they loved the lessons. They would be drawing on their own personal experiences of hearing health claims – like the cow dung – and were very active throughout,” she said.At the end of the nine-week session of lessons the researchers tested the children on their ability to assess health claims and compared them with a group of children who had not had the lessons.Research published by the team in the Lancet last year showed that 69 per cent of those children who had had the lessons scored highly in the test, compared to just 27 per cent of those who had not had them.A year later, the children are using their new knowledge, researchers have found.Dr Oxman says: “One of the concepts is that new and more expensive isn’t necessarily better and that’s one the kids carried away. One kid talked about not buying a new pair of shoes just because they were expensive.The alternative therapy of cupping has risen in popularity in recent years thanks to endorsements from celebrities such as Gwyneth PaltrowAnother talked about buying toothpaste. Mum wanted to buy a more expensive brand but when the kid looked at the label they realised the ingredients were the same.”While this might seem like a lightweight project, Dr Oxman says that learning to think critically is a vital tool – important not just for health but in many areas of life – especially as so many of us are wedded to social media, scanning our timelines for the latest news..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Critical thinking is much broader than just health – everyday decisions can become more informedSandra Galvin, University of Galway researcherCritical thinking is on a list of 21st century competencies people recognise as vital. Most people recognise the importance of knowledge about health but these two things have not been put together and there aren\u0027t many resources out there.I would love to see the whole world thinking critically – we really need this in the age of fake news. The same sort of skills apply to lots of political and personal decisions, he says.The new tool has been used in Norway and Rwanda and will soon be launched in Spain. Researchers in Ireland are also looking at introducing it in primary schools there.Sandra Galvin, a researcher at the University of Galway, is currently adapting the tool to work in Ireland with a view to launching it in two primary schools in 2019, before conducting a full-scale trial along the lines of the Lancet study.While it is unlikely that the Irish material will include advice on cow dung it may feature the old wives\u0027 tale that to get rid of a wart you should rub a potato on it.Old wives tales: spurious claims can impact on people\u0026#39s health all over the world“If we can get this into schools the real benefit will be long term,” says Galvin. “It would be great if in a few years’ time a student picks up a newspaper and reads about an energy drink making them run faster and they step back and say ‘hang on a second’. How was that study conducted, what are the biases, if the evidence doesn’t come from a randomised-control trial where does it come from?“Critical thinking is much broader than just health – everyday decisions can become more informed. We will have a population that has a critical eye,” she says.Currently, there are no plans to introduce the lessons into the UK but Helen Wilson, a lecturer in science education at Oxford Brookes University, believes there is space for it in the current curriculum.She led a study called Thinking, Doing, Talking Science which aimed to encourage primary school children to think more deeply about science. Pupils were asked ‘Big Questions’, such as ‘How do you know that the earth is a sphere?’ that were used to stimulate scientific discussion.Wilson\u0027s study found that the approach improved pupils\u0027 progress and had a particular impact on poorer children.She says: If you teach children to think critically about the content of the curriculum they do better. You produce young adults who critique and analyse rather than just absorbing information.It’s work that is more important than ever. There is so much information out there on the internet and on social media and the concerns over fake news and alternative facts. We would building responsible citizen.Sir Iain, who has been encouraging critical thinking around health for many years, believes that if the lessons do just one thing they will have been successful.I hope they turn the children into bloody awkward sceptics, he says.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security How the glaring lights of publicity turned a private family upside downRadio could be killed by streaming services, head of BBC radio warns Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerNorth Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit over military drillsMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, with Ms Markle\u0027s father Thomas – who was to walk his daughter down the aisle – claiming on Monday that he was no longer planning to attend the ceremony.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, he has reportedly changed his plans.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.So what\u0027s in store? Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.Thomas Markle Snr is apparently not coming to the wedding after reports this weekend that he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the ceremony and has suffered a heart attack.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.The celebrity website TMZ first reported that Meghan\u0027s father had pulled out of the wedding. The site stated that it had spoken to the US actress\u0027 father, saying: He\u0027s now decided not to go because he doesn\u0027t want to embarrass the Royal Family or his daughter.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsPrince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow the glaring lights of publicity turned a private family upside downRadio could be killed by streaming services, head of BBC radio warns Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerNorth Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit over military drillsMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow the glaring lights of publicity turned a private family upside downRadio could be killed by streaming services, head of BBC radio warns Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerNorth Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit over military drillsMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesBoris Johnson cautions against regime change amid scramble to save Iran nuclear dealThe Evolution of Royal WeddingsCoalition forces killed more civilians than Islamic State, study findsMedical cannabis should be legalised, says Royal College of Nursing Comment: Hamas are using their own people as expendable tools.

The \u0027dirty\u0027 jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.Anne, age 13 at the time, wrote the two pages on Sept. 28, 1942, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex behind a canal-side house in Amsterdam.Later on, possibly fearing prying eyes or no longer liking what she had written, she covered them over with brown paper, and their content remained a tantalizing mystery for decades.It turns out the pages contained four jokes about sex that Anne herself described as dirty and an explanation of women\u0027s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.A picture of Anne Frank behind Anne Frank Foundation director, Ronald Leopold, who said the adolescent was understandably curious about sex education, which is covered in the pagesThey bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank, Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House museum, said Tuesday.Experts on Anne\u0027s diary said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne\u0027s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.However, he said it provides an early example of how Anne creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about. In her diary, for example, she addressed entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.Anne wrote her diary while she and her family hid for more than two years during World War II. The family went into hiding in July 1942 and remained there, provided with food and other essentials by a close-knit group of helpers, until Aug. 4, 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne\u0027s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp. Anne was 15.After the war, Otto Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions. Please review our commenting policyHow the glaring lights of publicity turned a private family upside downRadio could be killed by streaming services, head of BBC radio warns Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerNorth Korea threatens to scrap Trump summit over military drillsMeghan Markle: The American actress joining the British royal family this weekendRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married this weekend (Saturday, 19 May). Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC\u0027s coverage will run from 9am until 2pm on Saturday.

More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is a historic moment. I\u0027d like to be a part of history. I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,” Mr Markle told TMZ.Mr Markle explained that he’d suffered a heart attack a week ago, with doctors informing him that his heart had been “seriously damaged.”With this in mind, there is the possibility that his doctors will advise him not to leave the hospital.However, if they give him the all-clear, Mr Markle has stated that he will do his best to travel to the UK so that he can be there to watch his daughter Meghan marry Prince Harry.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announce their engagement.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Crown Liquor Saloon, Belfast during their visit to Northern Ireland.

In essence, just how real are the pictures they take?A number of media outlets published images of Thomas Markle Sr getting measured for his wedding suit, while reading a book on British history, working out with weights in a park, and looking up reports about his daughter\u0027s wedding in an internet cafe. They initially appeared to have been taken by a member of the paparazzi without the retired television lighting engineer\u0027s knowledge. But the Mail on Sunday later published CCTV footage which purported to showed Mr Markle and the photographer entering the internet cafe together.Everything you need to know about the royal weddingLive updates on the build-up to the Royal WeddingThis is what the weather will be like for the royal weddingThe allegations the 74-year-old, who lives in Mexico, cooperated with an LA-based photo agency to stage images of himself getting ready for the wedding have been followed by reports he will not attend the royal wedding at Windsor Castle this Saturday. Mr Markle told TMZ he suffered a heart attack six days ago, but checked himself out of the hospital so he could attend the wedding. But according to the celebrity site, he has “now decided not to go because he doesn’t want to embarrass the royal family or his daughter”. A later report on the site indicated he had changed his mind once more and now intended to walk her down the aisle.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have called for understanding and respect to be given to the Suits actor’s father “in this difficult situation”.The images of Mr Markle raise pertinent questions about paparazzi photos in general and what proportion of such images are actually staged.Jesal Parshotam, a photographer based in London, argues there is a growing number of images which look like they are taken by paparazzi but are actually initiated by the inidual who is being photographed.How much land does the Royal Family actually own?“Often public figures, celebrities or even politicians stage their own images. Sometimes if they want to promote a certain object or fashion line then they will wear a certain item of clothing so they can be photographed in a good way. It is a very frequent thing, he told The Independent. “It is very predominant in the reality TV world but Hollywood stars also do it. When reality TV stars are in a new relationship, they will get photos taken of them.“The main reason is so they can control the images. If you stage photos, it means wider interest in them dies down. It’s about trying to have more autonomy and finding a way for the images to be beneficial for everyone.” Mr Parshotam said he thinks that while many iniduals are duped by staged paparazzi photos and believe they are taken by wholly unconnected paparazzi, others are more discerning.“If you look at the comments section on images online people will say these are staged, they are working with a photographer,” he said.“Henri Cartier-Bresson, a French humanist photographer who is seen to be a master of candid photography, believed the only way you can truly capture someone is if it’s truly candid, he added. In staged photos, they obviously try and make it look as candid as possible.”Land owned by the royal family – in picturesLand owned by the royal family – in picturesMr Parshotam argued that while some newspapers have taken the angle that Mr Markle was trying to make money, his real motivations could lie in wanting to control his public image.This view mirrors remarks made by Meghan’s half-sister, who has admitted to arranging the photo shoots of their father but claimed they were motivated by good intentions. “There’s a lot of scrutiny that it was money motivated, it was not,” Samantha Markle told ITV talk show Loose Women. She also tweeted that it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in an attempt to counter his bad portrayal in the press.The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault,” she tweeted. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money.This echoes the TMZ report which said Mr Markle vented about the fact that at times over the past year he had been ambushed by paparazzo who have taken unflattering pictures and believed the staged photos would alter his public image.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

It means Ramadan occurs around 11 days earlier each year.In pictures: Ramadan around the worldIn pictures: Ramadan around the worldRussian Muslims pray outside the central mosque in Moscow, during celebrations of Eid al-Fitr marking the end of the fasting month of RamadanTurkish Muslims offer Eid al Fitr prayers as they mark the first day of the Eid al-Fitr at Fatih Sultan Mosque in IstanbulA Syrian Dervish dances as part of a traditional event organised by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism under the title \u0027Music and Dervishes\u0027 in the old city of DamascusA Bosnian Muslim man, wearing a traditional Bosnian outfit, fires a canon from a vantage point overlooking Sarajevo to mark the end of daily fasting on the final day of the Islamic holy month of RamadanA general view of an illuminated Mosque as Muslims pray during the 27th night of Ramadan, in PeshawarMuslim women offer prayer of the Jumat-ul-wida, the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan at a mosque in LahoreMuslims offer prayers on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan in Dargah Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti The Prophet Mohammed Mosque in the holy city of Medina, during Ramadan A Malaysian swings around fireworks to celebrate the last day of the Muslims\u0027 Holy fasting month of Ramadan, in Shah Alam, outside Kuala LumpurKyrgyz Muslims pray during the Eid al-Fitr Muslim celebration marking the end of Ramadan in BishkekPeople pray during the Laylat Al Qadr prayers on the 27th day of the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan in the front of the Aghin mosque in AbidjanSyrians shop for traditional sweets in Kafr Batna in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, ahead of Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of RamadanA Palestinian woman prays on the third Friday of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u0027s Old CityIranian Shiite Muslims pray at the graves of soldiers who were killed during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, during the holy fasting month of Ramadan, just outside Tehran, IranA Palestinian man pours water on Muslim worshippers\u0027 heads to cool off in the heat, as others pray outside the Dome of the Rock at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the last Friday prayers of the Muslim holy month of RamadanAfghan women wait to receive food ration during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in HeratA Pakistani Muslim reads the holy Koran as he observes Itikaf at a Mosque, in PeshawarKashmiri Muslim women offer prayers as the head priest (not pictured) displays a holy relic believed to be hair from the beard of the Prophet Mohammed, during special prayers to observe the Martyr Day of Hazrat Ali, cousin of Prophet Mohammed, on the 21st day of Ramadan, at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirIndian Muslims sit with bowls of porridge(Nombu kanji)as they prepare to break the fast with the Iftar meal during the Islamic month of Ramadan at The Wallajah Big Mosque in Chennai Spectators watch fireworks as a giant Fanous, or Ramadan lantern, is switched on four days before the start of Ramadan month in front of Mohamed al-Amine Mosque in downtown BeirutLebanese children perform during activities celebrating the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in downtown BeirutPalestinian men drink tea on the promenade of Gaza beach Members of Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organisation in Indonesia, hold a mass prayer session to welcome in Ramadan in Jakarta Iraqis shop for food in a preparation for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in BaghdadFoods is seen during \u0027Unggah-unggahan\u0027 ceremony to welcome in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in Pekuncen villageThe start of Ramadan also varies from country to country by about a day, depending on when the new moon is sighted.  Eid al-Fitr is the ‘festival of the breaking of the fast’ and marks the end of Ramadan each year.Muslims wish each other a happy Eid during the celebrations by saying “Eid Mubarak” and often gather with family and friends to eat and pray together.The festival can last for up to three days and also sees people give money to charity as part of celebrations. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Moments later, Home Office official Hugh Ind told MPs the figure was ”up to five”.Mr Ind also admitted during his evidence that about £3.3m was paid out last year in compensation for detentions later ruled unlawful in the courts, and acknowledged that there was a “deep problem” with wrongful immigration detentions.When quizzed on whether Windrush citizens had been wrongly detained during the hearing on Tuesday, Mr Javid said he did not know, saying his priority was to know whether people had been wrongly been deported.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA demonstrator holds a flare during a protest against Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside the entrance to Downing Street in central London.The funeral cortege of Alfie Evans goes past Everton\u0027s Goodison Park ground in Liverpool.

In his strongest condemnation yet, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said “history will judge” the Trump administration’s contentious decision to relocate the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The comments came as he stood alongside Theresa May at Downing Street she had earlier stopped short of linking Palestinian deaths to the decision.In her remarks, Ms May reiterated her call for an independent and transparent inquiry into the killing of at least 60 Palestinians by Israeli forces in Gaza, saying the “use of live fire and the resulting loss of life is deeply troubling”.Haley tells UN ‘no country would act with more restraint than Israel’Trump has ruined any chance of a two-state solutionIsrael faces international condemnation over ‘massacre’ in GazaErdogan accuses Israel of ‘genocide’ after Palestinian deathsThis is how Israel could embrace returning Palestinian refugees Israel drops leaflets on Gaza warning ‘stay away from border protests’During their joint appearance the Turkish president said he would never accept the embassy move, claiming the US had contributed to the conflict.“The US claims to be powerful. You are powerful, but you are not right. History will not forgive you. This is the fact that we will observe in the future,” he added.“Israel will not be forgiven. That’s what we are going to witness in the future too. It all boils down to the fact of making a choice – are we going to side with the strong or side with those who are right?”President Erdogan added that the Israeli ambassador to Ankara had been expelled on Tuesday afternoon and its own ambassador to Tel Aviv has been recalled for instructions from the government.Post-Brexit, the UK will need Turkey more than everWhile Ms May urged Israel to “show restraint”, she stopped short of blaming Mr Trump’s embassy decision as directly contributing to the bloodshed in the last 24 hours.“Palestinians have the right to protest, but these protests must be peaceful. We are concerned that extremist elements are seeking to hijack legitimate protests to further their own objectives,” she added.Their comments came after Ms May had shook hands and posed for photographs with Mr Erdogan outside Number 10 as protestors demonstrating against human rights abuses in Turkey could be heard shouting “Turkish state, fascist state” and waved placards on Whitehall.Pro-Kurdish groups raised concerns about human rights abuses by Mr Erdogan’s government and urged Ms May to distance herself from the Turkish leader, who has been accused of purging opponents, sacking thousands of officials and jailing critics and journalists.Ms May meeting Mr Erdogan on the steps of 10 Downing Street(Rex Features)But during their joint appearance, the Turkish president denied reports that over 200 journalists are currently detained in the country following the failed coup against his administration in 2016.“You have to make a distinction between terrorists and journalists,” he said. “We are talking about ... Those who have been caught red-handed bearing weapons, those who have been killing people.“Are we supposed to call them journalists just because they bear the credentials and identity cards? They are not fit to do anything they want to do under the sun, are they?Turkish President Erdogan: ‘Jerusalem, Mr. Trump, is a red line for Muslims’“Currently, the Turkish judiciary is prosecuting and sentencing iniduals who have been associated with terrorism and involved in terrorist actions.”At the press conference Ms May said she had raised human rights issues with Mr Erdogan, adding: “It is right that those who sought to overthrow the democratically elected government are brought to justice but it is also important that in the defence of democracy, which has been facing extraordinary pressures from the failed coup, instability across the border from Syria and from Kurdish terrorism, Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend.“That is why today I have underlined to President Erdogan that we want to see democratic values and international human rights obligations upheld.”She also said the UK would “remain a true friend to Turkey”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqi are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf?

But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was not for money.It is now not clear who will walk Meghan down the aisle, although the 73-year-old has reportedly said he is happy for his ex-wife and Meghans mother Doria to take on the role.The Mail On Sunday reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of Royal Wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.TMZ first reported that Meghans father had pulled out of the wedding.The site stated that it had spoken to the US actress father, saying: Hes now decided not to go because he doesnt want to embarrass the Royal Family or his daughter.The statement issued by Kensington Palace indicates the concern Harry and Meghan feel for Mr Markle who is likely to be at the centre of intense media scrutiny in the coming days.The former lighting director was due to meet the Queen with Meghans mother Doria Ragland in the days leading up to the wedding being staged at St Georges Chapel at the castle.And at the same event he would have been introduced to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.Meghans father met her mother on the set of the US soap General Hospital, where he worked as a lighting director when she was a temp in the studio. They divorced when Ms Markle was six.Although she lived with her mother in Los Angeles, Ms Markle also spent a great deal of time with her father and is said to be close to him."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000376232389.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mps set to vote on whether to hold new press inquiry after disgraceful lords back fresh curbs on media","story":"For the second time in a week, the Government defeated plans to hold a re-run of the Leveson Inquiry.Labour failed to win over Tory rebels to the cause of press regulation as 301 MPs voted to ignore last nights Lords amendment with just 289 in favour of it.Speaking after the vote, Theresa Mays spokesman warned the Lords against any further attempts to meddle in the control of the media.He said: We welcome the vote. MPs have voted twice to reject a backward-looking, disproportionate and costly Leveson 2 inquiry.We would now urge the House of Lords to respect the wishes of the elected House.The Government win came after Culture Secretary Matt Hancock vowed to carry out a regular review of how the media handles sensitive data in a last-ditch attempt to head off a Commons rebellion.He also said ministers would act if the press self-regulation regime appeared to stop working well in future.Mr Hancock told MPs: “We have gone out of our way to offer concessions at every stage to make sure the system of press regulation is both free and fair.What we propose with this set of amendments is that this house can continue to debate and scrutinise the effectiveness of the self-regulation of the press, without requiring statutory regulation which we seek to avoid.Now is the time to look forward, not back and come together to build a vibrant, free and fair press that holds the powerful to account and rises to the challenges of our time.He was speaking after the House of Lords last night voted to hold a re-run of the Leveson Inquiry even though it had already been rejected by the Commons.Peers decision to back a controversial amendment to the Data Protection Bill meant that MPs had to vote again even though theyd already rejected the plans.Last week, the Commons narrowly voted against an almost identical amendment, proposed by ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband.But the margin of victory was just nine votes - raising hopes among anti-press campaigners that they could win over enough MPs to change the result second time around.Mr Hancocks last-minute offer of a new amendment enshrining regular reviews of the media was designed to convince the Commons there is no need for a full-blown inquiry which could drag on for years.It seemed to work - as the Governments winning margin increased from nine votes to 12.Speaking as MPs debated this afternoon, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said anti-press campaigners only wanted to get even with the media by holding a Leveson re-run.Tory MP Peter Bone - one of five Conservative rebels in last week’s vote - switched sides in today’s vote.He suggested that it was wrong for the Lords to defy the wishes of the Commons because Theresa May vowed not to hold a “Leveson 2” inquiry in her election manifesto last year.The only Tory rebels today were veteran Ken Clarke, Crispin Blunt and Philip Hollobone, as Dominic Grieve chose to abstain rather than opposing the Government.Senior backbencher John Redwood said in the Commons that the peers’ vote was “rather undemocratic”, adding: “They dont like results of referendums, they dont like the EU Withdrawal Bill... and now they want to regulate the press because the press points out the errors of their ways.”The Lords vote came despite senior peers warning their colleagues they risked undermining Britain’s tradition of the free press by holding a re-run of the inquiry.VOTED IN FAVOUR OF LEVESON 2 (291)Diane Abbott (Labour - Hackney North and Stoke Newington)ABSTAINED IN TODAYS VOTE (44)Ian Austin (Labour, Dudley North) - PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED LEVESON 2(Note: those abstaining includes MPs unable to vote because they are absent or ill. Does not include the Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, who dont vote, or seven Sinn Fein MPs, who refuse to take their seats.)Viscount Colville said: “Even the prospect of the bar being raised will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism.”And Lord Hunt added: “I suspect what lies behind this amendment is yet another attempt to exercise some statutory controls or levers over our free media.”The House of Lords will technically be able to push the Leveson 2 amendment again when the bill returns from the Commons - but it is highly unlikely they will seek to defy MPs for a second time.Despite being a well-paid columnist until last year, he hates newspapers for revealing he had an affair using his government-owned flat.LORD KERSLAKE: The former head of the civil service now advises Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, but press revealed he was nicknamed “Bungalow Bob” by staff as there was “not much upstairs.”Never far from the headlines after his bungling in Whitehall and later as an NHS Trust chief.PETER HAIN:The Labour arch-remoaner was forced to resign as Transport Secretary in 2008 in a scandal about undeclared donations from rich donors.He was left red faced after he put an expensive new roof for his “log store” on his expenses.LORD MENDELSOHN:The Labour big-hitter was forced to quit the frontbench in January after the press revealed he attended the controversial President’s Club Ball.Female waitresses were groped and harrassed at the all-male charity dinner that rocked the City.LORD MACLEAN:The former Tory whip led the charge to have MPs exempt from Freedom of Information laws when he was in the Commons.And he was a key player in trying to block the publication of MPs expenses ahead of the devastating 2009 scandal.BARONESS CHAKRABARTI: Corbynista peer Shami was accused of whitewashing antisemitism in the Labour Party in a duff report published shortly before she was ennobled.Exposed as a hypocrite for sending her son to £18,000-per-year private school after attacking grammar schools for being unfair."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406035415.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sichuan airlines pilot sucked out cockpit window","story":"Liu Chuanjian is being hailed a hero on Chinese social media after landing the Sichuan Airlines flight manually after his colleague was pulled back into the cabin.He told the Chengdu Economic Daily that the Airbus A319 had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet when a deafening sound tore through the cabin.The cockpit experienced a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature and when he looked over, the right windshield was gone.Liu spoke of the terrifying moment he realised his colleague had been sucked out of the window.He said: There was no warning sign. Suddenly, the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang.“The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window.Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned - and I couldnt hear the radio.“The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in and miraculously only suffered scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.Officials confirmed that none of the planes 119 passengers or any of the other cabin crew were injured in the nightmarish descent .Authorities said Frances BEA accident investigation agency and Airbus would send staff to China to investigate.Sichuan Airlines Flight 3U8633 left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.It made its emergency landing in the south west city of Chengdu.An unnamed passenger told Chinese media: “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake.“We didnt know what was going on and we panicked.“Then the oxygen masks dropped... we experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilised again.Im still nervous.

There could be a little bit of mist early on but that will burn off relatively quickly.The main uncertainty is cloud cover, with fair weather cloud developing through the afternoon - its temperature

twice a month.The study was commissioned by American Express to celebrate the launch of its new brand campaign and understand more about how the support of others can help propel you forward.Digital entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, who is working with American Express on the launch of its new campaign, said: “Having the support of others can be instrumental to success, but it’s not always about having friends in high places.Support can come from anywhere and more often than not it’s people you’ve known all your life.’’The study also found for nearly half of Brits (47 per cent) this social support network has become more important today than ever before.More than a third put this down to busier lives while 28 per cent blamed an increased pressure to succeed.According to the data, Brits believe having a support network around you is one of the most important factors to self-achievement.Additionally, the research identified the support network is primarily made up of a “backer” (64 per cent), a “comforter” (62 per cent) and a “cheerleader” (62 per cent).It also consists of a “constructive critic” (45 per cent) and a “big picture thinker” (40 per cent).Jamal Edwards, who is also the founder

markle dad thomas royal wedding wants walk aisle","story":"Thomas Markle has told TMZ he does want to make the trip, but his doctors might not let him travel due to recent health scares.Mr Markle earlier appeared to back his ex-wife Doria Ragland to be by their daughters side this Saturday after pulling out of the royal wedding last minute.That came following the revelation he had been paid to pose for paparazzi pictures.But he now appears to have backtracked, saying: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.He revealed he missed Meghans earlier phone calls but added shed messaged him to say she loved him and was concerned about his health.The 73-year-old dismissed the idea of the Queen being upset with him, saying: I dont think the Queen is thinking about what Im doing.What we know so far...It was earlier reported the father of the bride intended to check back into hospital after suffering more chest pains.And it was thought Meghan had been unable to contact her father since his decision to pull out.Thomas, who said he had a heart attack a week ago, insisted he would not walk Meghan down the aisle for fear of embarrassing her or the royals.Prince Harry was said to be blaming himself over the last-minute hitch - with Meghan pleading with her dad to change his mind.A source earlier told The Sun: “Meghan is devastated and wants her father to be there. They’re trying to work this out so he will come after all.”Another pal told The Daily Mail that reclusive Thomas was not in a good place after the picture deal was revealed.They said: (Meghan) obviously wants her dad there and the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do.Thomas initial no-show decision, just four days before the wedding at Windsor’s St George’s Chapel, caught the Palace completely by surprise - throwing its plans into chaos.Kensington Palace said last night: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.“She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”Thomas, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, was due to fly to London this week to meet the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Wills and Kate at a lunch ahead of the ceremony.But instead, it seemed Meghan might have to rely on her mother Doria to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day.It is understood Meghan, 36, had already asked her to be on standby in case Thomas was too unwell to come to the UK.The photographs which caused the initial upset showed Thomas in Rosarito reading a book on British history, working out with weights, being measured for a wedding suit and looking up Harry and Meghan at an internet café.The pictures were sold around the world — before the Mail On Sunday revealed they had been staged.Thomas admitted in the interview that the staged paparazzi pictures looked “stupid and hammy.”His confession is embarrassing for Kensington Palace, which had issued strong legal letters in an attempt to protect Thomas’s privacy.A source said: “Tom was really upset when he was photographed looking unkempt and dishevelled earlier this year.“He thought they made him look like a lush and he wanted a more positive image of him out there.“So that’s why he colluded with the picture agency and photographer to do better shots.”Thomas admitted accepting money from agency Coleman Rayner for the pictures.The chaos has also hit Prince Harry hard, with a pal telling the Daily Mail: He [Harry] is devastated. He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life - this is the price they have to pay.He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow.Thomas was pictured driving away from his home last Wednesday and staying the night at a motel in San Diego after crossing the US border.The next day, Thursday, he lifted two heavy pots of flowering plants and put them on Doria’s door step in Los Angeles along with a card.He was seen driving around LA, visiting the post office, pharmacy and bank before heading back to Mexico that evening.Thomas’s daughter Samantha, Meghan’s estranged half-sister, said the posed pictures were her idea.Samantha, not invited to the wedding, told ITV’s Loose Women she said: “My father doing staged photos is my fault.“I suggested he do positive photos. It was not for money.”She said she had no idea if he had been paid but added: “If he was it would have been a pittance. I’m entirely the culprit.I said to him to show the world ‘I’m getting in shape and getting healthy’ so I suggested it to benefit him and the Royal family.”Thomas’s grandson Tyler Dooley, 25, yesterday said his granddad had suggested only on Sunday that he would be at the wedding.He said: “My grandfather is in pieces – he is broken. He is not doing well.“He is a very reclusive guy — he has been in the spotlight his entire life behind the cameras and now he has been thrusted into all this with the Royals.“It is overwhelming. My grandfather just wants to be left alone — he wants the peace and the quiet back.”Tyler, a debt recovery worker, said of his Sunday discussion with Thomas: “He emailed me and I emailed him back.“He said he’s had some serious complications because of the stress, anxiety and pressure. I was also told that he had a heart attack. He had a pretty big health scare.“He told me that he loves me very much and he’s sorry about everything that’s happening.“He said he plans to get the care and the help he needs after the wedding — which told me that he was going.”Tyler said he believed Thomas would change his mind again and go to the ceremony — because he loves Meghan so much.He added: “There is no way he is not going to go to that wedding. That is his daughter and she loves him more than anything in the world.“I couldn’t be more proud of Meghan — she is everything to me.“She knows she has a big support base behind her and that’s all she needs to know.”If Thomas does not turn up, Doria will be the bride’s only immediate relative at Saturday’s wedding.But Tracey Dooley, estranged wife of Meghan’s brother Thomas Jr, is already in London with her two sons despite not having an invite.The three are set to appear on Good Morning Britain as part of the show’s Royal wedding coverage."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406467225.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside north koreas massive new holiday resort with three mile beach so would you go","story":"They appear to show more than 170 structures being built along a three-mile stretch of beach on the Wonsan-Kalma peninsula.The pictures reveal the construction of everything from a pyramid-shaped hotel, luxury villas and even an artificial lake, according to experts at NK News.When the tourist area is built, it will satisfy the demand of domestic and foreign tourists, the state-run KCNA news agency said in a statement.It said the chosen location would be the ideal place to link various tourist destinations to the Wonsan international tourist zone.Now high-resolution photos from Skysat show the North Korean dictator is following through on his promise.Pictures from the ground show buildings tens of stories high, meaning the entire resort could house tens of thousands of people.Meanwhile time-lapse imagery suggests the work began almost immediately after Kims speech and has been carried out at a rapid pace.It shows temporary shelters and workers facilities springing up along the coast between January and February.Photos even show floodlights being erected all over the beach so construction can continue at night time.North Korean soldiers are often drafted in to work on such projects, according to NK news, which says the resort could be completed as early as March.With tourism one being one of the few industries not targeted by US sanctions, experts believe the resort is aimed at making money through tourism.Wonsan and Kalma airport are also important defence areas, used for large-scale artillery drills and as the launch site for dozens of missile tests in recent years.In April last year, Kim used the same beach near Wonsans new airport to unleash an artillery drill described by state media as the country’s largest ever.Last year, America banned its citizens from visiting North Korea and there are no up-to-date statistics on current visitors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So the uniqueness made it special.In two previous cases of conjoined white-tailed deer fawns, neither made it through the full pregnancy.The discovery was made in May 2016 when a man came across the twins about a mile from the Mississippi River in Freeburg in south-eastern Minnesota.He contacted the states DNR and the body was subsequently frozen until an autopsy could be performed.A CT scan and MRI revealed the fawns had two separate head and neck regions, which rejoined along the spine.Internally the fawns had a shared liver, extra spleens, and gastrointestinal tracts, according to co-author Gino DAngelo, a researcher at the University of Georgia.DAngelo told UGA Today: Their anatomy indicates the fawns would never have been viable.Yet they were found groomed and in a natural position, suggesting the doe tried to care for them after delivery.The maternal instinct is very strong.Conjoined twins are commonly found in domestic animals, such as  this mutant piglet born in China last year, though it is rare to see it in wild animals.But last summer trawlers were shocked to pick up a dead two-headed porpoise off the coast of the Netherlands.Similarly, scientists were baffled to find perfectly preserved conjoined bats under a tree in Brazil.The two-headed baby deer has been mounted as if it is just waking up from a nap and will eventually be put on display at the headquarters of Minnesota DNR.Cornicelli added: We all thought it was pretty near and were glad to be able to show it to the public."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-sichuan-airlines-plane_4310816.jpg?20180515124009 ","title":"how vodafone was shaped into a behemoth","story":"The second Vodafone chief executive, who succeeded Sir Gerry at the end of 1996, was Sir Chris Gent, a prot\u0026#233g\u0026#233 of Sir Ernie Harrison, the East End docker\u0027s son who as chairman had taken Racal into telecoms in the first place.His period at the helm is remembered as a period of swashbuckling global expansion, during which Vodafone first moved into the US in a big way with the 1999 acquisition of Airtouch, for $66bn.This was followed a year later by what remains the biggest takeover ever done by a British company - the $183bn acquisition of German mobile operator Mannesmann, which put itself in play after agreeing to buy Orange in the UK, going back on a gentleman\u0027s agreement that the two companies had not to encroach on each other\u0027s turf.As required by the EU\u0027s competition authorities, Vodafone subsequently sold Orange to France Telecom, which today trades under the Orange name.Sir Chris was subsequently criticised for overpaying for Mannesmann, the deal having been done at the height of the bubble in telecoms, media and technology stocks, but his genius was in using Vodafone shares as its acquisition currency rather than cash.That not only meant Vodafone rode out the later downturn in the sector because, unlike some rivals that had used cash to do deals, its balance sheet was not as heavily geared. It also meant the company\u0027s by-then prodigious cash-flow - augmented by the sale of unwanted assets - could be invested in upgrading and expanding its networks, rather than having to be spent on servicing debt.Sir Chris\u0027s time is also associated with heavy investment in 3G licences around Europe.It was a thrilling time to be covering the company\u0027s fortunes and the soundtrack to it all was Bohemian Like You, a track by the US band The Dandy Warhols, which became ubiquitous as Vodafone became one of the world\u0027s heaviest-spending advertisers.When Sir Chris stepped down, in 2003, it fell to his Indian-born successor, Arun Sarin, to make all that investment pay off."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-israeli-forces-tear-gas_4310455.jpg?20180514205630 ","title":"israeli bullets didnt seem to frighten any gazans","story":"Men, women, teenagers and sometimes children would simply stay where they were, or would keep moving forwards.Israel has portrayed the protests as a Hamas project it claims it is sending people to the fence knowing they will get hurt to provoke international outrage against the Jewish state.It also accuses the group of using the demonstrations as a cover for terrorism.I asked dozens of protesters if this was the case.

Mr Grayling has the option of re-nationalising the network - a move demanded by Labour and rail unions, but would be a humiliating for the Tory cabinet minister. Or he could hand the operator, which is 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, a new non-profitmaking contract to run the service for a further two years.

It is especially rich that those Brexiteers who twisted the threat of Turkey’s potential membership of the EU to win referendum are now happy to kow-tow before Erdogan on his visit to London.   Boris Johnson, who played on fears about Turkey’s during the campaign and insulted Erdogan in a lewd poem , has since suggested we can do a “new jumbo free trade deal” with the country.   Mrs May’s press conference with Erdogan this afternoon could prove uncomfortable.   Will the Prime Minister dare to challenge the Turkish President on his human rights record?   And will she join Erdogan in condemning the slaughter in Gaza?   He has accused Israel of “genocide” and said the US shared responsibility with Israel for a “vile massacre.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa demands all sides show","story":"NewsTheresa May demands \u0027all sides\u0027 show restraint after Israeli troops shoot dead scores of Palestinians at Gaza borderThe Prime Minister did not single out either side alone for blame, despite Turkey\u0027s President accusing Israel of \"waging terrorism\" and saying: \"Israel will not be forgiven\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter18:46, 15 MAY 2018Updated19:00, 15 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May today demanded all sides show restraint after Israeli troops shot dead scores of Palestinians on the Gaza border. The Prime Minister did not single out either side alone for blame despite Turkey\u0027s President accusing Israel of waging terrorism and saying: Israel will not be forgiven. Mrs May stood alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the pair met for talks in Downing Street.  Erdogan - himself branded a fascist by protesters today over his human rights record - blasted Israel and its backers the US.  He said: You are powerful but you are not right. History will not forgive you and this is the fact we will observe in the future. Israel will not be forgiven.  So it all boils down to making a choice. Are we going to side with the strong, or side with those who are right?  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also accused Israel of flagrant illegality and demanded tougher UK action.  But Mrs May said: The loss of life we have seen is tragic and extremely concerning. Such violence is destructive to peace efforts and we call on all sides to show restraint. There is an urgent need to establish the facts of what happened yesterday through an independent and transparent investigation, including why such a volume of live fire was used - and what role Hamas played in events.  On Palestinians, she said: Palestinians have the right to protest but these protests must be peaceful. We are concerned that extremist elements are seeking to hijack legitimate protests to further their own objectives. On Israel, she added: The use of live fire and resulting loss of life is deeply troubling. We urge Israel to show restraint.” Palestinian officials say 60 Palestinians died yesterday after Israeli troops opened fire during protests on the Gaza border. The figure rose from 59 overnight after an eight-month-old baby died from tear gas. The girl\u0027s family said she inhaled the gas at a protest camp near the border. More than 2,200 Palestinians were also injured by gunfire or tear gas, local medics said. Yesterday was the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 2014 Gaza war.  Another Palestinian was killed today but numbers at the border were generally lower as protesters buried their dead. Palestinian medical officials say 106 Gazans have now been killed since the start of the protests and nearly 11,000 people wounded, about 3,500 of them hit by live fire. Israeli officials dispute those numbers and say they are acting in self-defence. The Israeli military said at least 24 of those killed on Monday were terrorists with documented terror background and most of them were active operatives of Hamas.

More than 40,000 people took to the streets of Gaza to demonstrate against the controversial opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. On Tuesday, Palestinians were observing a general strike to mourn those killed in the deadliest day in Gaza since the 2014 war. Middle East minister Alistair Burt said that moving the US HQ from Tel Aviv was not backed by the UK and that the government did not see it as being conducive at present in the region to the peace. He told MPs: The United Kingdom supports an independent investigation into what has happened. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told MPs that there had been an apparent calculated and deliberate policy to kill and maim unarmed protesters, who posed no threat to the forces on the Gaza border. She said: Many of them shot in the back. Many of them shot hundreds of metres from the border, and many of them children.  Ministers could not say whether arms sold to Israel by the UK had been used to fire on Palestinians at the border. Labour MP Richard Burden said the Government had written to him to say it did not collect data on the use of equipment after sale when he challenged them to investigate how sniper rifles and other weapons exported under licences from the UK to Israel were used. He said: Doesn\u0027t that answer mean the Government hasn\u0027t the first idea whether UK weapons are being used to shoot demonstrators in Gaza, and what does it take for the UK to enforce its own arms export criteria and stop arms sales to Israel?  Mr Burt said a proper risk assessment takes place before sales are considered, adding: Since the start of the recent difficulties in Gaza we have looked at all existent licences in relation to Israel and our sense at the moment is we\u0027ve no information to suggest that UK-supplied equipment has been used against protesters.  Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said peaceful Gaza protests have been exploited by extremists but urged Israel to show restraint in using live fire after violence claimed scores of lives. More protesters are expected today on Nakba Day (Catastrophe Day) which marks the 70th anniversary that saw thousands of Palestinians flee amid the creation of Israel in 1948. Alistair Burt said the tragedies should be used as an opportunity for a springboard to peace. Ministers discussed the situation in Gaza at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet where Theresa May urged both sides to show restraint and refrain from any further violence.

Sajid Javid revealed the shock figure in a grilling by the Commons Home Affairs Committee. It comes just weeks after Mr Javid, whose predecessor Amber Rudd resigned over the scandal, said he was not aware of any Windrush citizens being wrongly deported. Furious Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: The responsibility for these wrongful deportations stops at Theresa May\u0027s door. Apologies are not enough for the lives that have been ruined and the deep hurt and pain that communities have suffered. Campaigning MP David Lammy added: This is the worst human rights and home affairs crisis in my time in politics. The Prime Minister\u0027s hostile environment stands in the dock, guilty as charged. The 63 people are Caribbean nationals who were removed from the UK since records began in 2002, and who are also over the age of 45.  Their age means some of them might have arrived in Britain before 1973 - a legal cut-off date. Under UK law, anyone who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 should have had an automatic right to stay in Britain, so should not be deported. Home Office officials do not yet know how many of the 63 should have been protected under Windrush law.  Only last week the Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes, said she had not yet found a single wrongful deportation of a Windrush citizen. Her officials also suggested only a handful of people - five - had been wrongly deported from Britain at all in the last five years, even beyond the Windrush scandal. Yet today Mr Javid suggested the final total could be even higher than 63, telling MPs: It\u0027s not a final number at this point - it could change. The work on those records is still ongoing.  Of the 63 citizens, Mr Javid said 32 were removed because they committed crimes. The other 31 were administrative removals, which includes people who were sent Home Office letters telling them to leave. The cases were found in an ongoing trawl of 8,000 Home Office records on people deported from the UK since 2002. Mr Javid confirmed: Out of the 8,000, there\u0027s so far a focus on 63 where there\u0027s something on their record that indicates they could have been in the UK before 1973.  The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

The flowers were spotted being carried into a truck in boxes outside Philippa Craddock\u0027s London depot, the florist preparing flowers for the Royal Wedding.

Philippa provides flowers for weddings, events and brand campaigns.  At the time, Philippa said in an Instagram post: I am thrilled to share with you that we have been asked by Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle to create their wedding flowers in May.   I am loving working with them, it is an incredible privilege, and the designs will be a true reflection of them as a couple, with sustainability at the forefront. We will be using plenty of locally sourced greenery and seasonal flowers including peonies, garden roses and foxgloves.  Some of the foliage was expected to be gathered from The Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park, with beech, birch and hornbeam expected to feature. The flower arrangements will focus on flowers that are in season in May, and will have a wild feel - with bee-friendly plants from the Royal Parks\u0027 wildflower meadows set to be incorporated.

Thomas Markle Snr, 73, remains in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just four days away.  He had been expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but last night it was claimed he no longer plans to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi amid reports he had suffered a heart attack last week.  It\u0027s now emerged that the royal family were allegedly caught flatfooted when the news that he would not be attending broke last night, TMZ reports.  It added that up until that point the Palace had been planning a security detail, accommodation and access to events for the father of the bride. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims that it was blindsided by the news when approached by MirrorOnline. The news has cast light on not just Thomas Snr but the wider Markle family - who were completely unknown until they were cast into the limelight when Meghan got engaged to Prince Harry.   Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland could walk the American actress down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle if Mr Markle doesn\u0027t attend the ceremony.   He claims he hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan, 36, since reports emerged that he had decided not to attend the wedding.   Mr Markle told TMZ he\u0027s been popping Valium to ease his chest pains after suffering a heart attack, and he could return to hospital as early as Monday night.   Mr Markle told the website he suffered a heart attack six days ago and his new chest pains have been triggered by emotional upset. Reports suggest some plans for the wedding have been thrown into turmoil with Mr Markle deciding to stay put at home. Mr Markle allegedly sold the paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000, and admitted to TMZ that he was paid for the images.     It was claimed Harry is blaming himself after Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, reportedly pulled out of the wedding.  Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father, and has reportedly begged him to change his mind and walk her down the aisle as planned in front of 600 guests and a TV audience of millions. Harry and Meghan released a statement Monday night to address reports that Mr Markle wouldn\u0027t attend the ceremony.  A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation. In an interview with TMZ, Mr Markle called out his oldest daughter, Meghan\u0027s estranged half-sister Samantha Markle, who has criticised the Suits actress and claimed she was to blame for the paparazzi controversy. He added: I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.  The pensioner, who lives in the Pacific coastal city of Rosarito, Mexico, fears he will suffer a third heart attack, it was claimed.  Piers Morgan lashed out at Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.  He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles. Samantha, who suffers from MS, has claimed she wasn\u0027t invited to divorcee Meghan\u0027s first wedding - on a beach in Jamaica - because of her wheelchair.  The 53-year-old revealed she hasn\u0027t spoken to her sister since 2015.  She has also previously blasted the royal wedding guest list by claiming that she had shunned her own family in favour of thousands of complete strangers.  Meghan\u0027s estranged half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr, 50, wrote an open letter begging to be invited to the wedding, despite telling Harry to call it off.

Mary Crumpton, 44, lives with legal husband Tim and boyfriend John Hulls, 53, who she unofficially wed during a \u0027commitment ceremony\u0027 at the Unitarian Church in Chorlton, Manchester, earlier this month. The 44-year-old has two more boyfriends - Michael, 63, and 73-year-old James - who live just down the road. Mary was walked up the aisle by her 43-year-old husband. The second-time bride wore a white dress and celebrated with family and friends at a 100-strong reception. The 44-year-old last month spoke publicly about her relationships in the hope of allowing others to understand people who follow the practice polyamory. She told the Sun: It was a lovely day. Tim said a few words to bless mine and John\u0027s commitment to one another. We couldn\u0027t sign legal documents as polygamy is illegal in this country but in all other respects the ceremony was conducted like a normal wedding. Polyamory is having more than one relationship and is different from having more than one spouse.   Polyamorous couple reveal what it\u0027s really like to be in a marriage with three people  Speaking last month, Mary said: I was brought up in quite a traditional home. I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind. In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life. At the time I didn’t really question having just one partner. It was normal. I did sometimes have feelings for other people, but I felt guilty about doing so and just took it as a sign that I didn’t love my husband enough. When the marriage didn’t work out, I met someone else, and started a monogamous relationship with him. The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner. I had never come across it before, or the term ‘polyamory’ which means ‘more-than-one love’. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them. My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted. A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person. I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us. I took to it immediately. I had a friend that I was already close to and that friendship drifted very naturally into something more. My partner had a similar experience with a friend of his. It was a revelation to me. I quickly realised that I had been ‘wired up’ this way probably all my life - loving more than one person now seems like the most natural thing in the world to me and I can’t imagine being any other way. For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.  She continued: I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous. I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I have a partner, John, 53, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to ‘marry’ this year. We can’t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May. Both men are straight and have been brought together through Mary. They have all lived together since 2015. Mary has another two other partners, Michael, 63, who she has been with since 2016 and James, 73.  Mary said: John has been living with me and my husband in our house in Chorlton since 2015. He has a flat a few streets away from my house and I usually stay over at his place once or twice a week, and sometimes he stays at mine. Michael spent Christmas with us and we had a really special day together. Last but not least, I am with James, 73, who I bonded with while watching football games in the pub together in 2015. My husband and John have no interest in football, so it is nice to have someone to share that interest with. One of the lovely things about a life with more than one partner is that there is no pressure on one person to supply all my needs. My husband Tim and I share an enthusiasm for environmentalism and all that entails, like electric cars, and veganism. With my fianc\u0026eacute John I enjoy watching science-fiction and we go to church together. With Michael, I like to watch and support him playing for his local darts team at the Royal Oak, and we go to karaoke nights - which is possibly more embarrassing than admitting to polyamory. Living in a house with more than one partner is something I have done for a number of years now. I suppose in many ways it is no different from living in a shared house with a group of friends, or family. All the usual things about whose turn it is to wash up etc. Tim and John get on well, I suppose a bit like brothers, going on bicycle rides together for example. So it seems to work okay. They have something in common in that they both love me of course, and friends joke that I need two of them to keep me in-line. Like in any relationship, insecurities can arise. Though in some ways there is less jealousy perhaps - no fear that a partner might cheat on me because why lie about it when having another partner is allowed anyway? Sometimes there might be a fear that a new partner is ‘better’ in some way than a current one, but good communication and offering reassurances allows that to be dealt with.  In many ways I have found that being in open relationships has forced me to communicate much better. I am very honest and open with my partners about my feelings and needs, in a way that I didn’t have the courage to be in previous monogamous relationships. So I think I have grown as a person, and have better and stronger relationships now. Of course, all of that is possible in monogamous relationships, and I am not suggesting polyamory is in any way better, just different. But it works well for me personally. I don’t have children, and have no desire to have children. I see no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up though, because I have seen co-parenting work really well for other polyamorous groups. It is not something we plan though. Mostly people have been great. They had lots of questions about it, and some family members needed reassurance that we were all happy and no-one was getting hurt. I find that I have a huge capacity for romantic love. I just naturally fall in love with more than one person at a time. So to settle down with just one person for the rest of my life just doesn’t feel natural to me. People sometimes ask me if it means that I love my husband, or any of my partners less. And I say no. Perhaps it is a bit like how we love our children - when a parent has a second or third child, it doesn’t mean that they love their first child any the less. I think that romantic love is unlimited too. Time is limited of course. But I do not believe that love is. It certainly isn’t for me. I get different reactions. Most people are interested and people often say ‘I wish my wife/husband would let me do that’. I sometimes get negative reactions too - I have been called a slapper or a slag. I think that negativity mostly arises because I am doing something a bit different and sometimes that can make people feel uncomfortable.

Catherine Mayer, author of Charles: The Heart of a King , interviewed various members of the prince\u0027s inner circle who revealed the turmoil he was in the night before his wedding.

The mother bought an adult and child train ticket to Windsor at a packed Slough train station full of morning commuters but walked to an empty platform where no trains were due to stop.

In a statement read to the Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford at Reading coroner\u0027s court, her brother Zahire Khan said he was surprised to see the pair on September 23 when he stopped and spoke to them just 30 minutes before they died. I was surprised to see her as I had never seen her in town before and it was a school day and Amaar was with her, he said. They were surprised to see me as well, but a nice unexpected surprise and we stopped and had a brief chat. Amaar appeared to be happy and excited and I asked \u0027what are you lot doing here?\u0027 Rubina smiled and said she had an appointment with her dentist in London and Amaar had the day off.

Student Lucy White, 24, suffered a seizure caused by a toxic mix of cocaine and prescription drugs in her system. The seizure starved her brain of oxygen for more than 40 minutes as her partner cooked dinner in the next room. Lucy\u0027s older sister Stacey Jordan, 28, rushed to her bedside - finding her hooked up to wires and tubes - after receiving a terrible phone call in the middle of the night of May 3. Stacey has now shared the heart-wrenching photos of the top marks criminology student to warn others about the dangers of drugs.  Her social media post went viral with more than 200,000 likes and shares as Stacey bravely told the world her sister, who had previously volunteered for drugs charities, was dead and had donated her organs on May 7. She included pictures of a deeply personal letter Lucy had written to her last summer in which she thanked her for always being there and vowed to repay her one day. Stacey said: Anyone would say she was like a sunshine - her hair was bright blonde, and she was always smiling. She used to be terrified of getting into trouble. She didn\u0027t even drink that much. I can\u0027t believe it. She tried to make a difference in everyone\u0027s life, she helped everybody - and she was just happy.  I hate what has happened so much. She was clever, and she had everything going for her until, obviously, she didn\u0027t. Lucy, who was studying at the University of the West of England, was looking forward to getting her degree in the summer and had volunteered with the Bristol Drugs Project to help recovering addicts get clean. But after getting involved with the wrong crowd and finding herself dabbling in drugs, she suddenly dropped out of university and lost contact with many of her closest friends and family in January. Stacey claims doctors told her tests confirmed Lucy had taken cocaine and powerful prescription drug pregabalin when she suffered a seizure. She collapsed at home while partner Ian O\u0027Donoghue was cooking a pie in the next room. He called the ambulance and started CPR. Despite being rushed to intensive care at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, Lucy tragically died four days later.  Stacey, a security officer, said: I got a call in the middle of the night and it was just my nan screaming down the phone saying \u0027It\u0027s Lucy, it\u0027s Lucy, she\u0027s nearly died\u0027. When I got there, the doctor said a 24-year-old doesn\u0027t just collapse and have a seizure for no reason, she must have taken something. The doctors first said that she\u0027s going to be severely brain damaged, and then they said they thought she was brain stem dead. Once you\u0027re brain stem dead there\u0027s no reversal from that, there\u0027s no getting better, it\u0027s just that. When the tests confirmed it, I wanted to spend the last of her time here with her on my own. I just sat by her bedside and held her hand. According to Stacey, Lucy fell in with the wrong crowd in May last year when peer pressure, anxiety and loneliness during the summer drove her to cocaine and her life spun out of control.  Stacey, from Bristol, said: I got a message from her ex-boyfriend who told me she had started taking drugs and he was really worried about her. Lucy and I were about to go on holiday together, so I decided to wait until we were there to confront her. I hadn\u0027t seen her in a while - obviously she didn\u0027t want me to see her - and she looked like an absolute mess. She had lost so much weight and she was so skinny. She usually has her eyebrows, lashes and nails done, but she didn\u0027t look right. I just said to her \u0027I know everything, you need to tell me now\u0027 and she started crying and couldn\u0027t breathe. She said she was sorry that she didn\u0027t tell me, and I was furious, but I basically said \u0027I\u0027m going to help you, but you\u0027ve got to help yourself\u0027. I told her I\u0027d help her get clean but that she had to stay away from the people taking drugs.

Revellers for the Royal wedding are set for a sizzling treat with forecasters confident the blue skies and sunshine will hold out until Saturday - and probably beyond.  There is a chance the mercury could even beat the record currently set for May 19 (28.3C), which was recorded in the Argyll Forest Park in Scotland in 1948. Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told The Express spring could end with another potentially record-breaking bank holiday scorcher.  He said: “The remainder of this month will remain predominantly summery and confidence is increasing for another burst of very warm to hot temperatures for the next bank holiday weekend. “It is plausible that maximum temperatures could rise into the high 20Cs or even the low 30Cs for several days in a row within this period. This will pave the way for a warm and settled start to summer.” The weather will see a brief dip on Wednesday before turning warmer again. Spokesman Grahame Madge said: “High pressure is back in charge and so the outlook is for the weather to be largely fine through this week. “Confidence for good weather on Saturday is increasing, we expect temperatures of between 20C (68F) and 23C (73.4F).  “Temperatures will build through the start of this week with Tuesday likely to be the warmest day, we could possibly see 25C (77F) in parts. “A cold front will bring these values down by around six to nine degrees on Wednesday before it turns warmer again. “There may be some fronts approaching the northwest bringing unsettled conditions over the weekend, but for the majority of the UK we expect conditions to remain dry and fine. “There are no strong signals yet for this pattern of weather coming to an end.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said on Monday: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding. The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like sunblock not brollies for Harry and Meghan’s big day.

Kris Kacprzak and 15 other parachutists had made a scheduled jump from the small plane just minutes before it went down. His son Kacper stayed on board with pilot Neil \u0027Billy\u0027 Bowditch and both were killed in the tragedy in Co Offaly, Ireland. Mr Kacprzak, from Dublin, ran more than half a mile to the boggy site after witnessing the crash and desperately tried to dig out his son, the Irish Mirror reports.  A source close to the Irish Parachute Club told the Irish Daily Mail that the tragedy was unfolding by the time Mr Kacprzak had safely landed on the ground after jumping from the light aircraft. The plane went down on bog land in the Irish midlands on Sunday afternoon. The source said: Kris made the jump from the plane and by the time he landed, this terrible tragedy was unfolding. Kris dug with his bare hands during the recovery operation as we battled to save them.  Kris is something of a skydive enthusiast and Kacper loved his father. He loved planes and I have no doubt as he grew up would have loved to be up there with his dad. The source added: The pilot was a very well respected and experienced pilot from the UK. We have no idea what could have happened but it is very much tragedy for both families and for us as a wider community. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has been set up by Allaiouti Hassan, a friend of the Kacprzaks, to help both grieving families.

Footage of their bizarre find was posted to YouTube channel Explore With Us, and initially showed them walking around the rural camp. The derelict site in an unknown location shows vehicles left to rot and buildings crumbling to the ground. As the explorers continue their walk through the eerie site, they enter a tiny one-room building, before making their disturbing discovery. A metal shelving unit covering the back wall is pulled away, revealing a huge hole ripped in the wall behind - leading to the hidden room. The man filming the bizarre scene instructs another member of the team to investigate the contents of two tubs placed on shelving inside the room.  They then discover the tubs are filled with bullets before going on to film images of \u0027weird\u0027 cartoons and hardcore pornography stuck to the walls. The team then find ropes and bottles of alcohol littering the floor. While it\u0027s not known where the site is located, many viewers online said it seemed a great distance from any other signs of civilisation. Lance Shank said: That place is crazy. Whoever lived out there must\u0027ve been one hell of a person and probably not very welcoming to live out there with a watch out tower and surveillance cameras.  Other online viewers urged the explorers to call the police and report what they found. Paisley Campbell said: You should tell the police. Tell them you were hiking around and found this place..make an anonymous call So many lost and missing women and children in this country. Others had more rational explanations for the creepy site, suggesting it could have been a base for miners.

Criminologists have long known that many murderers share the same personality characteristics. But do those murderers also share the same star sign? David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolific or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out. Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April 20 and May 20 - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April 24 and February 18 stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decide if there really is a connection or if birthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. But if you have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18)  Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun? Aquarian serial killers include:  Gary Ridgway (Born February 18, 1949): One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer. Lee Boyd Malvo (Born February 18, 1985) David Birnie (Born February 16, 1951) Joel Rifkin (Born January 20, 1959) John Bodkin Adams (Born January 21, 1899) Luis Alfredo Garavito (Born January 25, 1957): Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolific serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly 150 boys and suspected of killing over 400.  Pisces (born February 19 to March 20)  Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign? Let’s take a look:  Aileen Wuornos (Born February 29, 1956): An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse. John Wayne Gacy (Born March 17, 1942): A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not. Dennis Radar (Born March 9, 1945): A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.” Stephen Port (Born February 22, 1975) Robert Napper (Born February 25, 1966) Colin Ireland (Born March 16, 1954) Peter Manuel (Born March 13, 1927): A Scottish serial killer. Doug Clark (Born March 10, 1948)  Aries (born March 21 to April 19)  They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of life, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:  Alexander Pichushkin (Born April 9, 1974): A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as 60 people. John Reginald Christie (Born April 8, 1899): An infamous serial killer who was active during the 1940s and 1950s. Herbert Mullin (Born April 18, 1947) Henri Desire Landru (Born April 12, 1869) Judy Buenoana (Born April 4, 1943)  Taurus (born April 20 to May 20) Although reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.  H. H. Holmes (Born May 16, 1861): Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything else. Michael Ryan (Born May 18, 1960): The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rifles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself. David Copeland (Born May 15, 1976): Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was. Karla Homolka (Born May 4, 1970): A Canadian serial killer who raped and murdered several children along with her husband. Albert Fish (Born May 19, 1870): One of the most well-known serial killers in the US, his nicknames included The Gray Man and Werewolf of Wysteria. A real-life Bogey Man, Fish was a child rapist and a cannibal. If this serial killer birthday matches yours, then you’re entitled to feel a little sick right now. Levi Bellfield (Born May 17, 1968): A child killer and rapist in the United Kingdom. Orville Lynn Majors (Born April 24 1961): Robert Black (Born April 21, 1947): A Scottish serial killer and paedophile. Steve Wright (Born April 24 1958): An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women. Martha Beck (Born, May 6, 1920)  Gemini (born May 21 to June 20)  The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something different. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.  David Berkowitz (Born June 1, 1953): Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose. Jeffrey Dahmer (Born May 21, 1960): The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims. Peter Sutcliffe (Born June 2, 1946): Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in 1970s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”. Richard Chase (Born May 23, 1950) Ted Kaczynski (Born May 22, 1942): Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist. Trevor Hardy (Born June 11, 1945)  Cancer (born June 21 to July 22)  Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.  Robert Maudsley (Born June 26, 1953): Responsible for the death of 4 people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.  Leo (born July 23 to August 22)  We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have?  Myra Hindley (Born July 23, 1942): One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK. Raymond Morris (Born August 13, 1929) John George Haigh (Born July 24, 1909) Anatoly Onoprienko (Born July 25, 1959): Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.  Virgo (born August 23 to September 22)  Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real life? Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers?  Ed Gein (Born August 26, 1906): A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin. Henry Lee Lucas (Born August 23, 1936): Convicted of around a dozen, confessed to many more, but is known to have lied about the majority of these. Peter Tobin (Born August 27, 1946): A convicted serial killer and sex offender who was active between 1991 and 2006. He was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh. Rodney Alcala (Born August 23, 1943): Was convicted of killing five people in California during the 1970s. Albert DeSalvo (Born September 3, 1931): Better known as the Boston Strangler, he is one of the better-known serial killers in the United States. Hs confession was disputed, and many believed he didn’t do it, but a DNA test performed in 2013 found that there was a 99.9% chance he did. DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.  Libra (born September 23 to October 22)  Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So, if there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.  Fred West (Born September 29, 1941): A man who murdered alongside his wife and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever. Beverley Allitt (Born October 4, 1968)  Scorpio (born October 23 to November 21)  Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.  Moses Sithole (Born November 17, 1964): A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive. Robert Pickton (Born October 24, 1949) Fritz Haarman (Born October 25, 1879)  Sagittarius (born November 22 to December 21)  Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world. But the same could be said for many killers who have done their bidding in far off corners of the globe. Their love of outdoors can make them strong and independent, while their distaste for clingy people could make them a little less compassionate and empathetic.  Dennis Nilsen (Born November 23, 1945): A British serial killer who targeted young gay men he knew no one would miss, before burning or flushing his victims. Ted Bundy (Born November 24, 1946): A charismatic serial killer who killed many young women and then defended himself in court. He was sentenced to death for his crimes. Rose West (Born November 29, 1953): The wife of Fred West, a woman who mirrored his sickening evil and helped him to kill young girls.

The bridge has been widely condemned in both the Ukraine and by the European Union who today called it a \u0027violation of Ukraine\u0027s sovereignty\u0027, according to AFP. In Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: The illegal construction of the Kerch bridge is the latest evidencenof the Kremlin\u0027s disregard for international law. It is particularly cynical that its opening is happening on the eve of the latest anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean-Tatar people by the Stalin regime. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 after the toppling of pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev. The bridge spans a treacherous strait between the Black and Azov seas, and gives a key link to the Russian mainland.  A rail crossing is due to be completed late next year. Heavy vehicles have already been driven across the bridge in preparation for Putin\u0027s arrival, although approach highways are not yet complete.  However, there is still a concern in Russia over security. Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov has warned: “We are constantly expecting provocations from Ukraine but believe me, we are highly ready to resist any attacks.”  He vowed: “The professional readiness of the FSB, police, and Russian National Guards is high. “Nothing can be excluded with this kind of power in Kiev.  “They are fully dependent on Americans, they do not think about consequences for Ukraine. “At first they said that there won’t be any Crimean bridge, now they are talking some nonsense that they will block the movement on the bridge.” Ukrainian businessman Lenur Islyamov called for all cars using the bridge to be logged and sanctions imposed on each driver. “I do not know how to do it but I am convinced that if Ukraine cannot stop the movement on the bridge, at least all transport should be registered that goes from Russia to occupied Crimea. “Everyone must be located, name by name.

It heated water from room temperature to 100,000 degrees Centigrade - in under a trillionth of a second. The Swedish team used a super strong laser machine to turn Earth\u0027s most important liquid into an exotic state - from which they hope to learn more about it. In less than a tenth of a picosecond - that is 75 millionths of a billionth of a second or 0.000 000 000 000 075 seconds - the water changes from liquid to plasma. The device called the Linac Coherent Light Source at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory near Palo Alto, California, shot intense and ultra short X-ray pulses at a jet of water.  The machine is a billion times brighter than the previous generation of lasers. Each X-ray pulse has as much power as the national grid of a large country, and a hundred are produced every second. Dr Carl Caleman said:  It is not the usual way to boil your water. Normally, when you heat water, the molecules will just be shaken stronger and stronger. At the chemical level heat is motion - meaning the hotter the molecules the more rapidly they move, according to Dr Caleman. This can be achieved via heat transfer from a stove, or more directly with microwaves that make the water molecules swing back and forth ever faster in step with the electromagnetic field. Dr Caleman, of Uppsala University in Sweden, said: Our heating is fundamentally different. The energetic X-rays punch electrons out of the water molecules, thereby destroying the balance of electric charges. So, suddenly, the atoms feel a strong repulsive force and start to move violently. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said a plasma is a state of matter where the electrons have been removed from the atoms, leading to a sort of electrically charged gas.

The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road.
