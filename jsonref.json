And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.Tasked with handling the deceased before taking measurements for their coffins,the volume of work the technicians faced was staggering, he says. “In a normal 24-hour period in hospital you’d have one or two deaths occurring – not including people arriving in ambulances. At the spike, they were receiving 20 a day, sometimes more. I can’t imagine how the technicians did it before we got there.”Any discomfort Murray initially felt was quickly put into perspective. “At first it was horrible and one guy had to leave because he didn’t like it, understandably. Then I thought: ‘Well someone’s got to do it.’” But having previously suffered from depression and PTSD, friends questioned whether the role was a good fit. “People were asking me if it would be good for my mental health and I thought: ‘Well, it is, because I’m doing something.’ If the bodies had suspected covid, we’d put them into sealed coffins, which meant families didn’t even get to see them. I kept thinking: ‘I’m the last person who’s going to see them’, which gave me a sense of purpose and duty, like I was doing something worthwhile. It felt like I was helping my country, really, just as I did in the marines. At least I could make sure they were looked after.”Murray is one of a growing number of veterans who have lent their support during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Johnny Mercer, minister for defence, people and veterans, says: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”To date, Re:Act has deployed more than 200 volunteers and has helped to ensure 2,700 deceased patients have been cared for, 1,000 hospital beds have been installed and 5.4m PPE items distributed.Now Murray wants to share his experience so we can learn from it. “People need to know that Covid-19 kills people and if you don’t act sensibly, it’s going to happen again. I can see people out and about already forgetting and it can be frustrating when you’ve seen what I’ve seen,” he says.He is passionate about ensuring the work of the mortuary technicians – like the doctors, nurses and supermarket workers before them – is talked about. “Those technicians were on their own before we arrived. I dedicate everything I do to them, they were absolutely amazing, brave and cheerful. That’s the commando ethos – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. They’re incredibly brave, doing a job nobody wants to do.”But while many veterans are volunteering for the first time, Murray is no stranger to this work. After leaving the marines – where he specialised in Arctic warfare – he turned to security and close protection services, running his own surveillance business until last year. “It was a horrible world, but one of the last jobs I did was for an animal rights company,” he explains. “I remember thinking: ‘I’m doing something worthwhile – I’m helping animals and using my skills.’’’ It led Murray to change tack completely, leaving behind his successful business. “I thought: ‘I can’t go back to that world, I’m going to do good,’” he says.Having suffered from poor mental health after leaving the marines, Murray explains he attempted to take his own life five years ago. It meant he was put in touch with armed forces charity Rock2Recovery, which sparked a friendship with Dan Elliot. “I went to hospital and they helped me get back on my feet,” he says. “I formed a friendship with Dan, who is an amazing guy. You can’t put a finger on how many lives that man has saved. I’ve lost four close friends to suicide in the past four years and I’ve been in hospital in various states of PTSD or depression, whatever you want to call it,” he says.Murray’s involvement with the charity – and his friendship with Elliot – opened his eyes to the volume of military and blue light workers also suffering from poor mental health. Now in a stable, healthy place, Murray devotes his time to connecting withthese workers via social media, where he shares videos about his experiences. “There are thousands of people who want help,” he says. “I tell them about my problems and we speak for hours – they’ll call me at night to talk. Many of them have never opened up to anyone before.”They meet in person, too. Having discovered the Wim Hof method – which combines cold-water exposure, breathing techniques and meditation, and Murray credits with saving his life – he invites veterans and those still serving to visit his home in the Peak District, sharing the vital skills and techniques. “They drive hundreds of miles and I take them to the river and we do Wim Hof breathing and jump in the river,” he says. “I’ve had lads and girls saying: ‘You’ve saved my life.’ I think it shows young people that suicide is not the answer and that you can come through the other side. I’m starting to live my life now and I’ve never felt so alive. It saved me, so I teach it.”While his role in the mortuaries has come to an end, Murray is still volunteering with Re:Act, with his latest job safely housing homeless people in nearby St Helens. “I believe this is what I was supposed to do – helping people. It’s my calling”, he says, when asked why he’s doing it. “I think by doing good things and by volunteering, it helps them and it helps me. I also hope that by teaching – and showing people through doing – that they might volunteer more. I’m confident we’ll find positives during this terrible time.”Next, Murray plans to buy a camper van to travel throughout Britain, visiting members of the armed forces, blue light workers and now, mortuary technicians too, to further spread his message and teach the breathing techniques he practises daily. His hope for the country is simple: “During Covid-19, I noticed we’re a community and everyone was looking after the vulnerable and the elderly, which was great but we should be doing that anyway. My message? To keep that going and get people to be kinder, that’s all I’m trying to do.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

When my own heroine Hannah is persuaded into a double murder plot by the rich Jinni on the London to Penzance train in The Golden Rule, it is no accident that her co-conspirator is wearing green.Jinni’s exquisite emerald garb is alluring, but she is not what she seems. Hannah, a millennial Cinderella and single mother who has attempted to escape her impoverished Cornish background through a university degree, spends most of the novel in old jeans and T-shirts. Only when loaned a Dior dress can she step out of failure and despair – though she reduces it to shreds.1. The Silver Chair by CS LewisThis novel is packed with clothes, but especially green ones symbolising nature, lust, magic and death. The seductive Lady of the Green Kirtle who bewitches and kidnaps Prince Rilian first appears to him in “a thin garment as green as poison”. It’s a great quest story, both funny and touching, and it takes two bullied children from a progressive public school in our world into the frozen north of Narnia, climaxing underground in a struggle that dramatises the nature of religious faith in a Platonic cave as the witch’s green dress turns into the coiling body of a gigantic serpent.2. Jane Eyre by Charlotte BrontëJane is so fiercely attached to her Puritan dress that even when about to marry the rich Mr Rochester she rejects bright colours for “sober black satin and pearl grey silk”. Paradoxically, this makes her passionate originality flame brighter to him – and us – an original touch that makes this poor, plain, intelligent and brave young woman eternally beloved by readers. When happily reunited with Mr Rochester, we learn through him that her dress is blue – the colour of heaven and happiness.3. Anna Karenina by Leo TolstoyAnna’s sumptuous black velvet ballgown, though revealing of her arms and bosom, is understood by the admiring Kitty to be “just a frame” because her “loveliness consisted precisely in always standing out from what she wore.” Tolstoy hardly describes Anna’s looks but makes us see her beauty and femininity in describing her ballgown, whose seductive colour foreshadows her eventual fate. She is the greatest tragic heroine in literature, and one I return to repeatedly. 4. Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien The greatest fantasy novel of the 20th century uses clothes to both reveal and conceal the true nature of protagonists. Frodo’s hidden mithril coat, “harder than steel … like moonlit silver”, is important not just because it is a gift that saves his life but because it represents the indomitable purity of his soul and will. When Sauron taunts the allies by bringing his coat out as a trophy before the Black Gate, they believe him to be dead but snatch it back to remember him by. It saves his life a second time in the final return to the Shire.5. The Great Gatsby by F Scott FitzgeraldDaisy’s “rippling and fluttering” white dress gives an airy impression of her essential lack of gravity when the narrator first sees her at home. The ultimate Jazz Age novel about doomed passion and the love of money, written in matchless prose, we soon see that the only thing that makes Daisy weep are Gatsby’s tailor-made “beautiful shirts”, possibly because they underline the materialism that has led her to marry a less rich man.6. I Capture the Castle by Dodie SmithThe impoverished teenage Mortmain sisters are obsessed by clothes (which their eccentric ex-model stepmother, Topaz, often forgets to wear at all). One especially farcical scene occurs when Cassandra’s beautiful sister Rose is so embarrassed by her inept flirtation with the rich Cotton brothers that she runs away from them in a “long shaggy black” fur coat and pretends to be a bear. Dressing in furs often symbolises the truth of our animal nature, and it later transpires that the bearskin coat escapade has given Rose a secret opportunity for more serious courtship in a delicious romp about innocence and youth.7. Monsieur Ka by Vesna GoldsworthyThe ache of poverty is keenly conveyed in this outstanding novel making deft use of an earlier novelist’s characters. Set in freezing postwar London, its Jewish heroine Albertine is the daughter of a tailor. She becomes drawn to Anna Karenina’s son Sasha, now an elderly emigre with his own family. As a refugee herself, Albertine has just one respectable dress whose silk can change in the light from grey-pink to red. Its ambiguity recalls Madame Bovary’s famous “gorge de pigeon” dress and slyly suggests that Albertine, too, is vulnerable to adulterous passion. Elegant, witty and sophisticated, Goldsworthy channels Tolstoy with complete assurance.8. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins The tomboyish Katniss must compete for her life in a dystopian TV contest. Her sympathetic costume designer Cinna puts her into “a simple black unitard… and a fluttering cape made of streamers of orange, yellow and red” that bursts into synthetic flames during the initial parade, instantly transforming her from dull representative of Panem’s despised coal-mining District to the public’s “Girl on Fire” heroine. Collins’s trilogy came to us before Trump’s America, but its satire on the kind of cruelly isive populist culture that led to his victory looks increasingly prescient. Katniss’s costume is especially thrilling because she will indeed become the fiery rebel leader of a revolution against the Capitol.9. American Dirt by Jeanine CumminsA middle-class Mexican bookshop owner, Lydia has left “her good church shoes” in the shower cubicle where she hides with her small son after her family has been murdered. To flee, she puts on her dead mother’s gold trainers, a magical detail because those shoes carry her as she jumps off bridges on to fast-moving goods trains going north. Only when finally crossing the desert into the US must she abandon them for tough, heavy boots and a grim new reality as an illegal migrant. A thrillingly propulsive, compassionate novel for our times.10. The Secret Countess by Eva IbbotsonWhenever I feel depressed, I reach for Ibbotson’s peerless romantic comedies (a cross between PG Wodehouse and Nancy Mitford), but this is my favourite. Anna, its idealistic young Russian refugee heroine is determined to earn her living as a “tweeny” in the dilapidated home of an earl. He has returned from the first world war believing he is engaged to the rich and revolting Muriel, who has a wardrobe of magnificent clothes and the heart of a Nazi. Anna must conceal both her aristocratic family and her humble occupation when her younger brother turns up as an unexpected guest, she pretends her maid’s uniform is a fancy-dress costume and her roughened hands due to method acting. However, the earl first sees Anna when she is washing herself in his lake and dressed only in her gloriously long brown hair. In a novel that is all about looking beyond appearances, not even a fig leaf is needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df5efb151c20accce090198ccd42b6b714727741/0_287_4337_2604/master/4337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5962f634e1bfcbc236386183618df4e5","title":"job losses uk house prices covid 19 ssp factories markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsTime for a recap, after a day of grim job losses....and encouraging economic data.The Covid-19 pandemic has hammered Britain’s travel industry and retail sector today, with thousands of jobs at risk.SSP, which runs the Upper Crust chain, began the day by announcing up to 5,000 job losses - or over half its workforce. It warned that business will not recover for months, given the slump in flights and railway journeys.Ryanair swiftly followed, saying that 3,500 jobs would be cut unless staff agreed pay cuts. The pilots’ union have now said they would accept a cut to earnings:With Airbus announcing 15,000 job cuts last night (including 1,700 in the UK) and easyJet cutting 4,500 across Europe, the travel industry is looking bleak.So is retail! John Lewis hit its staff with bad news this morning - some stores won’t reopen, due to the pandemic, and their bonus is being cut too.UK factories have also cut their workforce last month, even though the downturn in manufacturing in Britain - and beyond - appears to be easing.UK house prices have also been hit, falling on an annual basis for the first time in eight years. Germany has also reported a rise in unemployment, up 69,000 in June.But US companies have hired nearly two million more staff this month, according to the ADP payroll company, as states have reopened their economies.US factories also reported a jump in new orders last month, as the slump in activity during the pandemic eases.German biotech firm BioNtech and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer cheered investors, by reporting encouraging early results from their Covid-19 vaccine trial. This dragged European stock markets off their earlier lowsThat’s probably all for today. GWIn another encouraging sign, the Institute for Supply Management has reported that US factories returned to growth last month.Its PMI index has jumped to 52.6 for June, strongly back into growth, from just 43.1 in May. ISM’s New Orders index surged, suggesting a significant turnaround in fortunes last month.Here’s some reaction:America’s factories have also reported that the Covid-19 slump has bottomed out.The US manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, has surged to 49.8 in June from 39.8 in May. That’s the biggest jump on record, showing a major improvement.Factories reported that new orders stabilised, helping to curb the slump in production.HOWEVER, although this looks like a V, it does not mean that the US economy has recovered. A PMI of 50 shows stagnation, not strong growth. But it’s an encouraging start. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: “US manufacturers have reported a marked turnaround in business conditions through the second quarter, with collapsing production and demand in April at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown turning rapidly to stabilisation by June. The PMI posted a record 10-point rise in June amid unprecedented gains in the survey’s output, employment and order book gauges.The record rise in the New Orders Index, coupled with low inventory holdings, bodes well for a further improvement in production momentum in July. A record upturn in business sentiment about the year ahead likewise hints that business spending and employment will start to revive.However, while the PMI currently points to a strong v-shaped recovery, concerns have risen that momentum could be lost if rising numbers of virus infections lead to renewed restrictions and cause demand to weaken again. Over in Brazil, the manufacturing slump has bottomed out.Brazil’s factories have reported a pick-up in output and new orders last month, lifting its manufacturing PMI back over 50 points, and into growth.Wall Street has opened higher, as traders welcome the encouraging early stage results from the PfizerBioNTech Covid-19 vaccine tests.Vaccine news: German biotech firm BioNtech and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer have reported some promising results from their early trial of a Covid-19 vaccine.The two firms report that the early-stage drug had shown potential -- human trialists who received the drug developed antibodies against Covid-19, at higher levels than often seen in patients who caught the virus.This shows that the vaccine “yields immune activity and a strong immune response,” says BioNtech CEO Ugur Sahin. They now plan to conduct wider trials.This is cheering investors, who are desperate for good news about a vaccine that could end the pandemic and allow economies to reopen.Shares in both companies have jumped, and the wider market is also shaking off its earlier losses.Economists are welcoming today’s ADP Payroll report, and the news that 2.4 new jobs were created in June:There’s also astonishment that May’s data has been revised so dramatically, from 2.7m jobs lost to 3m created. ADP’s report is based on actual payroll figures, not finger-waving estimates, but clearly the pandemic is making it harder to produce accurate data.Just in: US companies hired nearly 2.4m extra staff in June, as America’s economy emerged from lockdown.Payroll company ADP has reported that the labor market strengthened last month, with private sector employment up by 2.369m. Small business (with less than 50 staff) hired 937,000 more staff, with medium-sized firms taking on 559k and large companies (at least 500 staff) taking on 873k.Service sector firms took on 1.9m new workers, ADP says, including nearly one million in leisure and hospitality, after States eased Covid-19 restrictions. Manufacturers hired 457k more staff. Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said that small business hiring picked up in the month of June, adding:“As the economy slowly continues to recover, we are seeing a significant rebound in industries that once experienced the greatest job losses.In fact, 70 percent of the jobs added this month were in the leisure and hospitality, trade and construction industries.” This will please the White House - although the recent lockdowns re-imposed in states such as California, Texas, Florida and Arizona could lead to fresh job losses.ADP has also pulled a screeching u-turn on May’s numbers. Last month, it reported that 2.76m jobs were lost. It now thinks that 3m were created!The job cuts announced today by John Lewis and Harrods show that department store are reeling from the pandemic, writes my colleague Sarah Butler here:Back in the markets, anxiety about the Covid-19 pandemic is pushing shares down.Sir Philip Green is also wielding the jobs axe, according to fashion trade magazine Drapers.It reports that Green’s Arcadia group is cutting 500 head office jobs, or one in five positions. And again, the Covid-19 lockdown is responsible, with Arcadia anticipating weak retail sales for some time.In the email to staff, seen by Drapers, chief executive Ian Grabiner said: “We are continuing to live through an unprecedented global crisis and, as you know, our stores and head office temporarily closed on 20 March. Although our digital platforms provided us with some much-needed sales whilst our stores were closed, it certainly didn’t make up for the loss of sales from our stores and franchise partners.“We and our partners are unlikely to see the same level of footfall on the high street anytime soon. We can’t ignore the impact this will have on our business and we need to adapt. We have already been reducing our store estate over the last few years but we also need to generate further cost savings across our company in order to ensure we have a solid foundation for the future. In order for us to achieve this, we need to restructure our head office to support a more focused and future proofed organisation.”It is understood that staff will receive more information about their inidual situations later today. Drapers understands that the job cuts impact various teams, including those in buying and design across Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.Ratings agency S\u0026ampP has warned that the UK could be heading into a ‘perfect storm’ of economic misery.In a new report, S\u0026ampP says that Britain is vulnerable to a second-wave of coronavirus infections, followed by an economic jolt if it can’t agree a free trade deal with the EU before 2021.“A second, bigger wave of (coronavirus) infections in autumn, then followed by a switch to WTO trade rules in January would be a perfect storm.”Even Harrods isn’t immune to the economic cost of Covid-19.Business Insider is reporting that the Knightsbridge-based luxury department store is cutting almost 700 jobs, as it tries to cut costs. Although Harrods reopened last month (with social distancing rules), the slump in international travel has badly hurt the store, which is usually very popular with well-heeled tourists.Harrods CEO Michael Ward told employees about the cuts in a memo early on Tuesday, June 30.“The necessary social distancing requirements to protect employees and customers is having a huge impact on our ability to trade, while the devastation in international travel has meant we have lost key customers coming to our store and frontline operations. The Covid-19 pandemic is also forcing job cuts at retail group John Lewis, according to reports this morning.The Evening Standard says Sharon White, its new chair, has warned staff that some stores will close permanently, resulting in job losses. The blow comes as John Lewis also announces another raft of store reopenings.In a bombshell letter to staff, Sharon White this week told 80,000 staff at the mutual, which also includes Waitrose, that its prized bonus will likely be ditched next year as the company wrestles to improve profitability.At the start of the Covid crisis, sources at the group warned it was unlikely all 50 of its department stores would reopen after the lockdown. White confirmed plans to close a several unnamed shops, with staff informed in mid-July. Around 20 stores have reopened since non-essential retailers were given the green light to reopen on June 15 with distancing measures in place. Plans to open a further 10 were announced today, including Oxford Street on July 16.John Lewis is also planning to vacate one of its two large London offices, in response to the jump in home working.

The Eurex exchange are trying to get systems working right now, after a two-hour outage.The problems disrupted derivatives trading and stock markets in several Central and Eastern European countries, and prompting Denmark to postpone a bond auction. Trading issues on the Eurex Exchange, one of the main platforms for futures products, hampered bond sales in Europe. Prices for German bund futures hadn’t updated since 7:47 a.m. in London, while Denmark postponed a bond auction due to the technical difficulties.Stock trading in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Ljubljana and Zagreb was also down, as these venues share Deutsche Boerse’s T7 trading infrastructure. As recently as mid-April, another outage of the T7 system hobbled trading across the same set of Central and Eastern European stock markets.Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank, also fears a flood of job losses at UK factories -- even if the economy returns to growth.Manufacturers are now bracing themselves for the second half of the year in the knowledge that a reckoning looms. The winding down of the furlough scheme by the autumn, and lower business levels in a number of subsectors, means more redundancies are likely.History shows that, sadly, more firms tend to face the risk of failure coming out of recession due to cashflow challenges than going into one. This is compounded by many manufacturers having to manage higher debt levels that they would normally operate with. Understanding and managing the risks of overtrading for businesses of all sizes will be critical.The sector will need to continue to show resilience, agility and careful planning, to battle through such challenges.” The pandemic is forcing Britain’s manufacturers to keep slashing jobs.Data firm IHS Market reports that employment at UK factories fell for the fifth consecutive month in June. Although the rate of decline eased further from April’s record it remained among the steepest registered in the 28-year survey history. There were reports of redundancies, cost control efforts, workforce restructuring and the non-replacement of leavers. Manufacturers also reported that new orders kept falling in June, although output did rise as more factories returned to work.This lifted the UK manufacturing PMI to 50.1, just above stagnation.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit , fears that job losses will accelerate as the UK government winds up its furloughing scheme:“The main focus is now shifting towards the labour market. Concerns are rising about the potential for marked job losses, especially once the phase out of government support schemes begins. The news on that footing is less positive, with June seeing a further reduction in staffing levels and, although easing sharply since April’s record, the rate of job loss remains among the steepest in the 29-year survey history.Economic conditions will need to improve markedly across the UK, or some support retained, if the labour market downturn is to avoid becoming more entrenched through the remainder of the year.” Here’s our news story on the downturn in UK property prices:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e8e53a7aace5a72d952fd6f6c147ee5272d3a33/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13dea78ee3a37c44b4435393c057a709","title":"government lockdowns leicester covid 19","story":"The fight against Covid-19 is still being hampered by a reluctance to decentralise resources and authority The decision to implement a lockdown in Leicester is a mixture of good news and bad. We’re finally seeing a localised approach to the control of coronavirus. But we’re also witnessing the consequences of the government’s mismanaged and disorganised system for detecting outbreaks and dealing with the pandemic.The national lockdown that was implemented back in March was both necessary and effective. Transmission declined, the epidemic curve was flattened, and hospitals were not overrun. But it was a blunt measure that caused a great deal of collateral damage. Loosening the national lockdown was inevitable. As countries such as South Korea and Germany have shown, a combination of measures – including social distancing, improved hygiene, and an active system for testing, tracing and isolating – can keep the number of coronavirus cases down to a manageable level.But for this to work, the government’s test, trace and isolate programme would need to be effective. This would mean having much more active case detection than is presently the case, through a greater uptake of testing by the public, and through targeted testing of potentially infected clusters of people identified by primary care providers and local public health teams. This would enable public health teams to detect small outbreaks early, quickly following these up with further investigation. Small outbreaks couldn’t necessarily be prevented, but ideally they could be contained before they grew into larger, uncontrolled outbreaks.Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, the government’s over-centralised, fragmented, confused and semi-privatised patchwork of testing and contact-tracing services has proved slow, inadequate and cumbersome. There are still too few tests being done, leading to insufficient case detection, and our contact-tracing rates are also low. Delays in producing test results are compounded by delays and blockages in the sharing of data across the various different organisations involved.Local public health teams have been inevitably hamstrung by this centralised system. Ideally, local public health directors and their teams would have timely and complete data about new cases, including the names, ages, genders and ethnicities of suspected cases, their home, work and school details, and relevant clinical data such as the date that their symptoms started. But nobody seems to have been given this information. It’s no wonder that 11 days into the reported Leicester outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had to concede that the government was “still getting to the bottom of” the reasons why the outbreak had occurred.The apparent reluctance to share data with local public health teams is worrying. But it’s also curious. What’s the point in collecting data if it isn’t then shared with the people who need it? Moreover, the government appears more concerned with data control than it is with infection control when it comes to local public health teams. And yet it appears to have no qualms about secretly sharing NHS data with private companies through its Covid-19 datastore project. The government only agreed to release some information about its deals with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Faculty and Palantir after a legal challenge.It’s equally concerning that the government has been continually unwilling to own up to its faults and mistakes. Hancock’s claims that a highly localised approach, with “targeted action” at factories, workplaces and schools had been undertaken in Leicester for 10 days prior to the announcement of the lockdown doesn’t tally with the many local politicians who have complained about being unaware of what was happening in Leicester until over a week after the outbreak was first noticed. And by simultaneously announcing a set of new measures for Leicester, including a walk-in test centre in the city, alongside new mobile testing units, Hancock was implicitly admitting that the testing system in Leicesterhad not been up to scratch.The falsehoods, spin and bluster that have characterised the government’s handling of the pandemic are perhaps as much of a threat to public health as coronavirus itself. Incompetence erodes professional and public trust, which are vital in any effective disease control strategy. If the government doesn’t learn from and fully address these fundamental problems in its response, we should not expect Leicester to be the last city to lock down again in the UK.For months, public health professionals have been lobbying the government to establish competent and sufficiently resourced local public health teams to help manage the Covid-19 crisis. Such teams could have been hosted by local government public health structures, and been given the mandate to lead on local test, trace and isolate systems, investigate new cases and monitor local behaviour. The teams would include primary care, social care and hospital representatives, and link to regional and national bodies. With their local knowledge, they would draw in the support of the community and voluntary sector, and harness expertise from nearby academic institutions to create the right mix of technical, strategic, organisational and scientific expertise and capacity.This could have been set up across the country within a matter of weeks. Information systems could similarly have been rapidly designed to feed these teams with accurate, reliable and complete real-time data. A network of contact tracers and community health workers could then have been organised and supervised to take the actions that would have prevented the people of Leicester from suffering the effects of a new local lockdown.That said, the task facing local authorities should not be underestimated. Local government has been undermined and badly damaged by budget cuts over the last 10 years. Expecting local authorities in places such as Leicester to play this critical role in managing the Covid-19 epidemic, including being effectively responsible for enforcing a localised lockdown, would need central government to not just decentralise resources and authority, but to also better embrace the idea of localism and trust.• David McCoy is a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9f4526a1ecc0302c4ac47fcf18c2b643b600d3/373_266_2934_1759/master/2934.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=532a2d681e75e2eb17ceb602c24d874c","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7682a32703dc843b988dd961471afd767485506f/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b5ea9f2c3696071896661f5d04d246","title":"air pollution likely to make coronavirus worse say uk experts","story":"Experts say further investigation of link is urgently required and may be relevant to managing pandemic Air pollution is likely to be increasing the number and severity of Covid-19 infections, according to the UK government’s expert advisers.In a report published on Wednesday, the experts said further investigation of the link between dirty air and the coronavirus pandemic was “urgently required” and may be relevant to how the pandemic is managed.The reports add to pressure on ministers to address the issue of air pollution and coronavirus, following calls from MPs for action and warnings from lawyers that the government has a legal obligation to urgently review its air quality strategy.There is growing evidence from around the world linking exposure to dirty air to increased coronavirus infections and deaths, with some suggesting it plays a significant role. But ruling out other possible factors is complex and time-consuming, meaning a definitive conclusion is yet to be reached.Exposure to air pollution is firmly linked to increases in respiratory and heart disease and these factors can increase the risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms, said Prof Alastair Lewis of the University of York, the chair of the UK government’s independent science advisory group on air pollution. “Given this, it would not be surprising if there was a link between exposure to air pollution – past or present – and the Covid-19 infection.”The section of the report on this issue was written by another government advisory group, the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, chaired by Prof Frank Kelly, of Imperial College London, and composed of 15 academic experts.“Although there is, as yet, no clear empirical evidence that exposure to air pollutants increases the likelihood or severity of Covid-19 infection, knowledge of the impacts of air pollution on health suggests that this is likely,” the group concluded.“Potential interactions between air pollution and Covid-19 may be relevant to the future management of the pandemic in the UK and elsewhere,” said the committee. Medical resources might be raised in polluted areas, for example.Long-term air pollution may worsen the impact of Covid-19 on patients, while short-term pollution may irritate the lungs and increase the risk of infection. Traces of the virus have also been found in samples of air pollution, raising questions about airborne spread outdoors. “Further investigation into all of the possible mechanisms is urgently required,” said the committee.In June, lawyers acting for Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project told ministers that the potential risk to life posed by air pollution during the pandemic means ministers must act even if the evidence is not yet conclusive. Dirty air is already estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.Ninety parliamentarians have also urged the government to back action on air pollution to help avoid a second wave of coronavirus, while an air pollution inquiry by a select committee of MPs is examining delays in the rollout of clean air zones in cities as a result of the pandemic.The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups, who are disproportionately exposed, was recently called “astonishing” and “wholly irresponsible” by critics of a Public Health England review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6258498af89848ba331e517aee74b7f90ce0163c/0_247_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7f245230258476059a27cb58774d16","title":"europe losing forest to harvesting at alarming rate data suggests","story":"Rise in harvesting could affect ability to combat climate crisis due to carbon absorption capacity reducingEurope has lost a vastly increased area of forest to harvesting in recent years, data suggests, reducing the continent’s carbon absorption capacity and possibly indicating wider problems with the EU’s attempts to combat the climate crisis.Other factors are therefore likely to be in play, and these could include increased demand for wood as a fuel, and bigger markets for timber and other wood products. The satellite data could therefore be an early indicator of unsustainable demands being placed on the EU’s forests.Ceccherini told the  that the observed increase in harvesting and the loss of biomass was unlikely to result in a decline in the area of the EU that is forested overall, as most of the harvested forests would be regenerated. But it would disrupt the carbon absorption capacity of the EU’s forests in the short term, he said.However, the researchers said it was important to find out why the harvesting has increased so suddenly, in case it indicates wider underlying problems with the way in which Europe’s forests are being managed. This study cannot definitively establish the causes of the increases in harvesting, so more research is needed.Increase in demand for timber and wood products, such as pulp and paper, and more burning of biomass for fuel may be behind the rapid rise in harvesting observed in the Nordic countries. If so, according to the researchers, it is important to know so that any adverse impacts can be quickly contained.Prof Thomas Crowther, founder of Crowther Lab, who was not involved in the research, said: “It is concerning to see that the increasing demand for forest products may be reducing the carbon stored within living biomass in European forests. It is possibly more concerning that forest removal may also threaten the storage of carbon below ground. These high-latitude forests support some of the largest soil carbon stock on earth. If forest clearing threatens the integrity of high-latitude soil carbon stocks, then the climate impacts may be stronger than previously expected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25004f4e240ddf6f062920f27c5b018584ce21a2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801cd452f0d65bd2f8ab77975b66692f","title":"water firms raw sewage england rivers","story":"Untreated effluent flowed into waterways for more than 1.5m hours, data showsWater companies in England discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions last year, according to data obtained by the .The analysis reveals untreated human waste was released into streams and rivers for more than 1.5m hours in 2019.The figures, obtained via environmental information requests, trace releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies and provide a comprehensive picture of the scale of pollution from what critics say is the routine dumping of untreated sewage.Popular English rivers including the Thames, the Windrush, which runs through the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire, the River Chess, a chalk stream in Buckinghamshire, the Avon in Bristol, the Severn, and the River Wharfe in Ilkley are among the many affected.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works. Only when it has been treated is wastewater released to the environment, either out to sea through long outfalls or coastal discharges, or into rivers.The vast majority of England’s sewer network is a combined system, which dates back to Victorian engineering, and is designed to collect the contents of people’s toilets and surface rainwater then transfer them together to treatment plants.After extreme rainfall, the treatment works cannot cope with the volume of water and untreated sewage. Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.The data emerges as increasing numbers of people are using England’s rivers to swim, kayak and paddleboard.Countries are legally obliged to treat sewage before it is released into waterways. Discharges of untreated human waste are permitted only in “exceptional circumstances” for example after extreme rainfall, the European court of justice has ruled.But the scale of the sewage releases in 2019 reveals what one industry insider said was the frequent and routine nature of discharging untreated effluent from storm overflows.The source, who has worked in the industry for many years, said the discharges released “a horrible septic mix of nasties into the rivers”.He said the industry had for years ignored warnings about the growing scale of spills from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) – storm pipes that allow rainwater, untreated sewage and runoff to discharge into waterways.Recent scientific research has also raised concerns that Covid-19 can be carried into rivers via sewage discharges. data reveals 6,508 inland CSOs released untreated sewage into rivers 204,134 times in 2019. The spills discharged for 1.53m hours across the nine English water companies.Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Sewage discharges should take place only in the most extreme of circumstances. Regulation needs to be tightened to stop water companies using discharges as a day-to-day measure.“Customers will rightly be shocked at the frequency of sewage discharges and the damage it does to some of our country’s most precious and valuable river habitats.”The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste, which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper, from CSOs after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes.More than 60 discharges a year from a storm overflow should trigger an investigation by the agency but the data reveals some storm overflows have released discharges hundreds of times. The Environment Agency relies on water companies to self-monitor their CSOs.Ashley Smith of the campaign group Windrush against Sewage Pollution said the system was little more than a “licence to pollute”. Smith, who monitors sewage spills on the River Windrush in Oxfordshire, said discharges happened after just a rain shower.He said: “The industry has been given a way to prop up failed infrastructure and it has exploited this enthusiastically. The inability of the Environment Agency to prosecute or even drive improvement has led us to where we are today – in a complete shambles with pollution rife and unchecked.”Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust described the data as “very alarming”. The environmental charity worked with the ’s data to create an interactive map where you can search for river discharges by area.She said: “When you look at the detail, you see that some of these locations are releasing untreated sewage hundreds of times a year, so they are not just operating during extreme rainstorms.”A recent study revealed the quantity of E coli coming out of CSOs was between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than that coming from treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants.Walker said: “People think our rivers should be fit to swim in but they don’t realise it is legal to discharge untreated raw sewage into our rivers.”Water companies say the spills are so diluted by rainwater and wastewater that they do not affect the quality of the water.Wessex Water said: “As CSOs should only operate during periods of intense rainfall, any foul water released from them will be very dilute … Rarely is a pollution incident attributed to a CSO operating correctly.”Water companies were told by the government to install monitoring on the majority of their combined sewer overflows by March 2020. But by June, the  data reveals 3,400 out of about 10,000 inland outflows owned by the nine water companies still had no monitoring installed.Wessex Water has fitted monitoring devices to 495 of its 1,018 CSOs that can discharge into rivers and inland waters. Last year untreated sewage was released 13,876 times – more than twice as often as in 2018 – with a total duration over the year of 107,404 hours.South West Water has monitors on 410 of its 548 inland CSOs. In 2019, sewage was discharged from them 7,850 times over 36,149 hours.Yorkshire Water discharged untreated sewage from the 730 inland CSOs, which are monitored 22,906 times over 616,643 hours. Most of its 2,240 outflows into rivers are not fitted with monitors. data shows Southern Water released raw sewage into rivers last year 19,977 hours in 3,219 incidents.In March, the company separately pleaded guilty to 51 pollution charges over five years involving breaches of Environment Agency permits at treatment plants, which included 8,400 incidents of sewage escaping.Severn Trent has fitted monitoring devices to 1,239 of its 2,897 inland CSOs. The monitored storm overflows discharged untreated sewage for 272,518 hours in 2019.Dr Andrew Singer, a senior scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the pollution impact of CSO discharge was a risk to ecological and human health.“English rivers, even the Thames and the Severn, are relatively small, so the contribution of CSOs to many of our rivers can be extremely significant,” he said. “Rivers are much more likely to be impacted now by CSOs because of the increase in population density and the fact that the sewage system has not expanded to meet it.”Singer called for more transparency from water companies.A spokesperson for Wessex Water said: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system, but many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage … Since 2000 we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 CSOs, and there are plans to improve more over the next five years.”The Environment Agency could not say whether any of the 1.5m hours of spills had led to an investigation.A spokesperson said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign the system is faulty or being misused.“However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.”The spokesperson said there was more to do to improve water quality, despite substantial improvements over the past two decades. “We have already secured a more robust and consistent approach for water and sewerage companies to monitor CSO spills.”A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK, said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network.”• Visit an interactive map, created by the Rivers Trust with the ’s data, where you can search discharges in your area.• Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621830b87003585e894d48efdb78fdc0fe4c7d3/0_0_5129_3078/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ab929304f49e4999be05007f7cd2ed","title":"are private schools serious about tackling racism i give them a d ","story":"These institutions are reacting to questions about their makeup with committees, discussions and action plans.

JK Rowling sparked widespread fury when people realised they couldn’t cast a silencio spell over her and stop her committing that terrible crime of talking about how female biology has affected her life. And – oh yeah! – we are still living through a global plague.So a lot has been going on. This may be a radical admission from a journalist, but I pretty much stopped stopped following the news while I was off, for my own sanity. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in again. While I was blissfully trying to ignore everything and stop having more sodding opinions, I received an email from my old private school in New York, which reassured the alumnae that, in the wake of the epidemic of killings of black people in the US, there would be “discussions” between the teachers and pupils about “violence against people of colour”. Also, the school library is curating an “anti-racism reading list”. Alas, the discussions and reading list were not enough and some former students told the New York Times that they had suffered from racial abuse while at the school. Cue further panicky-slash-handwringing emails from the school, culminating in a “plan of action”. This included more “ersity training”, an “inclusive curriculum” and, last of all, a promise to “review student composition”.British private schools have sent out similar letters and made comparable statements. They are, as the currently popular phrase has it, “doing the work”. But are they? Westminster School has said, in response to recent complaints from former students, that it is establishing a “challenging racism committee”, and that it will work to “ensure a erse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”.I called Westminster, curious as to how it would achieve this erse and reflective community, given that its fees are in excess of £41k a year for boarders, and more than £28k for day students. It could not share that information, but it reminded me it had formed the challenging racism committee “which will look at the ersity of both the staff and pupils”. When I asked whether this would just be about racial ersity or also other forms too, I was told to ask again later in the year.Gender and ethnicity are important, but social class remains the biggest factor in determining the quality and length of a person’s life in this country, so it should play a bigger part than it does in the vogue for identity politics, not least because race and class intersect so much. If private schools were really serious about ersity, they would expand scholarships for working-class kids of all backgrounds. At the very least, they would let state schools use their facilities I once visited a state school in the morning that didn’t even have a library, and then a private one in the afternoon that had a screening room. Instead, they issue press releases about “discussions” and reading lists. It boggles the brain that these schools have charitable status in the UK.I get a lot of guff in my inbox, from fashion brands avowing how anti-racist they are despite never featuring black models in the shows, to Instagram influencers fighting oppression one sexy selfie at a time. But the schools issue is more important, given what an enormously unfair advantage private schools give to a child’s long-term prospects and it is gross – if entirely predictable – how little the schools are willing to try to change to stop entrenching inequality. As efforts go, I give this a D-.

The former 007 discusses fatherhood, family and the lonely childhood that shaped himI am 10 minutes into my Zoom interview with Pierce Brosnan when his son Dylan arrives off-screen with his father’s coffee. “Did you put sugar in this?” he says to the 23-year-old. “Some more milk, please, I don’t take mine black.” Dylan is sent back to correct it.Naturally, the pandemic has disrupted Brosnan’s schedule, too he was shooting Cinderella in London until Covid-19 halted production. He returned to the northern shore of Hawaii, where he has remained since with his wife, the journalist and author Keely Shaye Smith, and their two sons, Dylan and Paris, 19. (Brosnan also has three children from his first marriage.)“We are a close family and this time of covid has nourished and nurtured a bond between us all that probably would not have existed without the lockdown,” he says.Brosnan is sitting at his kitchen table, in front of a bright Indigenous Australian painting, which he bought in Sydney during a “tour of duty” as James Bond. He is here to talk about his supporting role in the Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. The film, which was originally scheduled to coincide with this year’s contest, follows two would-be pop stars (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) in their quest to represent Iceland in a fictionalised version of the competition.There was hopeful expectation in some quarters that Brosnan might lend his singing voice, given his infamous performances in the Mamma Mia! films (his singing in the first film was so comical that it landed him the Razzie for worst supporting actor at the 2009 awards). Was he shocked not to be given the chance to sing on screen again? “I was surprised, I was disappointed, I was crestfallen,” he responds, good-naturedly.Brosnan plays Ferrell’s disparaging father (“Which I thought was a bit of a long shot”), who resents his son’s wild ambitions and wants him to aspire to a more conventional future. It is not a parenting style familiar to Brosnan. “My boys are academic and have a creative instinct and intuition towards the arts. So I don’t try to direct them.”His younger sons’ careers in film-making, acting (Dylan) and modelling (Paris) have seen them amass their own fame they have social media followings in the tens of thousands. They stole the show at this year’s Golden Globes in their roles as ambassadors, shepherding celebrities on and off stage in black tie. Does their social media fame worry him?“Yes, it does concern my wife, Keely, and I,” he says. “The footprint that they’re leaving will stay with them for many years to come. It’s treacherous waters. I went on Instagram to follow Paris, to make sure that he was acquitting himself well and not entering into any kind of liaisons with folk of ill repute. It’s a strange animal and you have to be careful with it. It can be narcissistic and you have to balance it out with human lightness.”Born in 1953, Brosnan was raised in Navan, 30 miles north-west of Dublin. An only child, he has described his childhood as a solitary, Roman Catholic upbringing. “My father took off for the hills and, for my mother, it was a very difficult time in the 50s to be a single parent. So, in many respects, I created my own self,” he says.After his father left, his mother moved to London when Brosnan was four. She wanted a better life for them. He waited for her in Ireland and lived in a succession of houses – with his maternal grandparents’, with his aunt and uncle, at a boarding house.“I’m very grateful that I didn’t have the shackles of parenting, so to speak, and really cleaved my own path in life. When, as a young teenager, I told my mother that I wanted to be an actor, she was extremely supportive of that. She wholeheartedly said: ‘Follow your dreams.’”Brosnan moved to Putney in west London when he was 12. At school, he was nicknamed Irish. “Being an Irish immigrant in London in ’64, they don’t let you forget that.” He later worked briefly as a commercial artist, but, having been raised on “cowboys and Indians, Old Mother Riley, Norman Wisdom”, he still dreamed of acting.Brosnan stumbled upon the Ovalhouse theatre in south London and found himself “in the company of poets and musicians and outcasts and mangled souls”. His breakthrough came when he landed a small part in a Tennessee Williams play, The Red Devil Battery Sign, as the understudy.“It didn’t work out for this other fellow,” says Brosnan. “I got the call: ‘Tennessee wants to see you now.’ I tore out of the flat and hopped on a bus. The bus was going too slow, so I got off and ran. My heart was pounding – Tennessee Williams wants to see me. I got to Tennessee’s apartment, and we read through two very emotional scenes and just let it fly. And I got the job.”They opened at the Roundhouse theatre in north London in 1977, with Brosnan’s performance receiving critical acclaim. Williams sent him a telegram stating only: “Thank God for you, my dear boy.”“It was an affirmation that I was on the right path, that I had the talent – a tiny bit of gold in my back pocket,” says Brosnan. “That made me hungry to be an actor. Once I found the world of acting, I clung to it with all my heart. It was liberating.”It was a hugely successful start to a stage career, but Brosnan’s ambitions lay elsewhere. “I always dreamed of the movies,” he says. “The stage, as exhilarating as it was, always terrified me. I wanted to be up on the silver screen.”In 1982, he landed the role of the charming TV detective Remington Steele. He moved to California with his first wife, the Australian actor Cassandra Harris, and their son, Sean, and her two children, Charlotte and Christopher, whom Brosnan later adopted. In 1987, Harris fell ill while filming in India and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died four years later. Charlotte would die of the same disease in 2013.Brosnan turned to the therapeutic qualities of painting while Harris was ill and he has continued ever since. “I started painting in 1987 when my late wife had cancer. I had been painting out of pain, and now the pain sometimes comes through in colour,” he said at the charity auction of his painting of Bob Dylan in 2018. It sold for €1.2m (£1.1m).He found the fortitude to keep acting, too. In 1993, he made it on to the silver screen in Mrs Doubtfire. “At day’s end, you want to look around and hopefully you have a handful of films that you can be proud of participating in. That is definitely one of those movies for me.”He speaks just as fondly of the film’s late star, Robin Williams. “I went into the makeup trailer and there was Robin, sitting in the makeup chair. He had a Hawaiian shirt on and cargo pants, and his hairy arms and hairy legs hanging out. He had the head of Mrs Doubtfire and greeted me: ‘Oh, Pierce! Oh, you look so handsome, oh, give us a kiss.’” (Brosnan’s Mrs Doubtfire impression is impeccable.)At this point, Brosnan had already been offered the role of Bond, but had been obliged to refuse it due to his Remington Steele contract. When he made his Bond debut, in 1995’s Goldeneye, he made it count.His iteration of Bond – sensitive, suave, serious – proved to be a huge success, critically and commercially. Hindsight has bolstered Daniel Craig’s gritty, brutish incarnation of 007 as the best since Connery’s, but Brosnan played the role with a twinkle in the eye and the humour that such a cartoonish character deserves.After his final outing as Bond, Die Another Day in 2002, the producers felt the franchise needed a reboot to stay relevant in a post-911, post-Bourne world. Although Brosnan was keen to do a fifth film, the producers had settled on recasting the role and told him so over the phone in 2004 he would later say he felt he had been “kicked to the kerb”. “There’s no regret,” he says now. “I do not let regret come into my world … It just leads to more misery and more regrets.”“Bond is the gift that keeps giving and has allowed me to have a wonderful career. Once you’re branded as a Bond, it’s with you for ever, so you better make peace with it and you’d better understand that when you walk through those doors and pick up the mantle of playing James Bond.”Since relinquishing the role, Brosnan has generally been reticent about later instalments (“Not my monkey, not my circus,” he said in an interview with Esquire last year). He has, however, said enthusiastically that it is time for a woman to take over the role (“Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there!”). Why does he think there is so much resistance to recasting the role of Bond (and other iconic British figures, such as the Doctor in Doctor Who) as a woman or a person of colour?He pauses and slowly taps his kitchen table. “I’m gonna leave that right there,” he says, with a knowing smile and a single, slow shake of the head.Brosnan has had a successful career since leaving the franchise – his performances in The Matador, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and Mamma Mia! stand out – and he was not hampered by the weight of the role he left behind.In 2010, Brosnan starred as a fictional British former prime minister accused of war crimes (yes, he based his performance on Tony Blair, he says) in Roman Polanski’s thriller The Ghost Writer. What does he make of the criticism of those who work with Polanski, given his rape conviction?Brosnan is silent for a full 10 seconds. “Well,” he says, steadily, “I took to the role and to the part in The Ghost Writer because of the work that Roman has done as an artist, as a director. I didn’t let the rest of his life influence my choice. I had to be honest with myself and know that justice had been done, half undone, and went forth as an actor.”Would he make the same decision again today?“I don’t know if, in this climate, I would have made the same decision, the same choice. These are dangerous times and it’s a very toxic world. I don’t know.”When he talks of the “climate”, it is clear he is referring to the world after #MeToo. “It was shocking,” he says of the scale of abuse powerful figures such as Harvey Weinstein got away with for so long. He punctuates every few words with a short pause. “It was absolutely appalling and really has changed the landscape and the workplace for women in Hollywood. It was a mighty fall from grace and one that was really ugly and sad for all parties concerned … that this man should have acquitted himself in such a fashion in the company of young women who were trying to make a career for themselves – it was upsetting to see that behaviour unfold on a daily, weekly basis.”Brosnan has been prolific in recent years. He has four films in production and a fifth awaiting release.“I have no desire to retire,” he says. “I am a man of 67 years now and the parts that will come to me will be the parts of the elder, the parts of the comedic turn. At this point in life, I don’t know what else to do but act and paint.”In the immediate future, there is a pandemic to navigate and a US presidential election on the horizon (Brosnan is a dual citizen of Ireland and the US). More than once in our conversation, Brosnan laments “the disease of racism” and urges people to vote. “I would like to think that the vaccine will come soon for the disease of corona. And I would like to think, also, a vaccine will come for the disease of racism and that we can really come together as communities to respect each other’s religions and beliefs and not to be so judgmental.”He continues: “With change comes struggle. But I have hope in our young people, I have hope in my sons’ generation that they will see the awful, shameful neglect that we’ve paid to each other’s religions, race, the nature of our lives, the environment that we live in. I have the strongest belief that the youth of today will make a big change, will have the courage to get out and vote for the rights of people – not racism and not ignorance and malignant narcissism.”If this sounds like wishful thinking, it is in keeping with Brosnan’s nature. “My eldest son said: ‘Dad is just a dreamer.’ But my dreaming has gotten me this far in life. So I shall continue dreaming and continue being the man I am and doing the best I can, with the tiny bit of gold talent that I’ve got.”Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is out now on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8254cc51be58bc0749aba8741dc4e63e40ec09/752_1513_6136_3680/master/6136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4be97cecaf4a169679865e5347e4798","title":"how to cook crab linguine recipe felicity cloake","story":"Revive memories of Italian seaside cafes with this step-by-step guide to making classic crab linguineFew things scream summer holiday to me more than a big bowl of briny, seafood-studded pasta, even if it’s going to be eaten in front of the TV rather than some pretty Italian harbour. Happily, seafood is one of the things we do rather well in this country, and this dish is the perfect end for a fat, brown, British crab. Sunshine optional.\u0026nbsp2 brown crabs, or 200g brown crabmeat and 200g white crabmeat 400g linguine2 garlic cloves1 red chilli1 tbsp olive oil1 tsp fennel seeds, crushed1 lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly choppedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishStart with the crab. You may have bought it ready picked, but if not, you’ll need to get at the meat first. There are many online videos and tutorials showing this process in detail, but start by snapping off the claws close to the body, then remove the bottom of the shell by inserting the tip of a knife into the mouth (just below the eyes) and twisting gently.Prise off the back of the shell and locate and remove the hard spiny bits around the eyes and mouth, and the yellowish stomach sac attached to them, plus any bits of papery membrane and the dead man’s fingers, the greyish fronds around the edge of the shell. (Despite the name, they’re not poisonous, but they’re not very tasty, either.)Scoop the brown meat into one bowl and the white into another – a\u0026nbspsharp tap with a hammer, rolling pin or even a wooden spoon will help you to get into the stuff in the claws. Don’t miss the white meat in the leg sockets, either the handle of a teaspoon is a useful tool here. Keep any large pieces of claw meat separate.\u0026nbspBring a large pan of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta to your taste – this should take around eight to 10 minutes, unless you like it very al dente or very soft. Linguine is my preference here, but spaghetti, or any other long pasta, would also be fine (in fact, let’s be honest, almost any shape would be delicious).\u0026nbspWhile the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, and deseed and finely chop the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds for a couple of minutes until soft, but not coloured remember that garlic, in particular, burns easily.Take the frying pan off the heat, grate in the zest of half the lemon, then squeeze in the juice of the whole thing (do this through your other hand, to catch any errant pips alternatively, squeeze it into a cup and pour it into the pan through a sieve). Now stir in all the brown crab meat until well combined.\u0026nbspScoop a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water out of the pan and set aside, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan, season and toss it around to coat the strands with the sauce add a little of the reserved cooking water, if you think it needs loosening.\u0026nbspRoughly chop the parsley, set a little aside to garnish and add the rest to the pan along with the 200g white crab meat (if you don’t have any large claw pieces, keep a little bit back, to finish). Toss again, ide between bowls and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with the remaining parsley and the claw (or reserved white) meat, and serve at once.If you’d like to add vegetables, the River Cafe puts shaved fresh fennel into its crab pasta, while River Cottage goes for fresh tomatoes (I reckon a handful of the cherry variety, added to the pan with the garlic and chilli, so they just burst in the heat, would be best). Tinned crab doesn’t seem to work well here, sadly – or at least not the brands I’ve tried.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window. This is, of course, the ultimate test of any cherry recipe: does it represent any sort of improvement on just eating cherries? If it’s close, a stoner may tip the balance.You can buy gadgets that stone six cherries at once, or machines that will stone a whole hopper full but, for a seasonal task like this, a little effort – a little ritual, even – is probably a good thing. It ought to take you a bit of time. There are other satisfactory methods, like this one using a bottle and a chopstick, but you may have to find the right bottleneck for your particular size of cherry. You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea894d0e90ebe352423e8717744ce7b754a13533/0_132_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c91d9dcc396e83ddcc09032c28640e","title":"arsenals vivianne miedema named fwa womens footballer of the year","story":"Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema has been voted women’s footballer of the year by the Football Writers’ Association after a Women’s Super League season in which she scored 16 goals in 14 appearances.The Netherlands forward got a double hat-trick in the 11-1 win over Bristol City in December and also provided four assists, and is the leading Champions League scorer with 10 goals.She led the Netherlands’ charge to the 2019 Women’s World Cup final, which falls in this voting period, and finished the tournament with three goals, as her country’s record goalscorer and with a runners-up medal after a 2-0 defeat by the USA.Miedema took the FWA award by one vote from Chelsea’s Beth England.

Such penalties are applied in a following season only if a club is already relegated. In Wigan’s case, with Paul Cook’s side 14th and eight points above the relegation zone, the penalty is likely to be applied this season and could push the club into League One.The club stated on 4 June that under the EFL’s owners’ and directors’ test, the league had approved the sale to NLF by the owner since November 2018, International Entertainment Corporation (IEC), a Hong Kong-based, Cayman Islands-registered company which owns a hotel and casino in the Philippines.The EFL’s test and takeover process involves determining that a new owner has the money to buy a club and support it financially for at least the remainder of the season and the whole of the following season. However less than a month later and a week since Au Yeung was announced as the majority owner, the club has appointed the administrators Gerald Krasner, Paul Stanley and Dean Watson of insolvency practitioners Begbies Traynor.In a statement, Krasner said: “Our immediate objectives are to ensure the club completes all its fixtures this season and to urgently find interested parties to save Wigan Athletic FC and the jobs of the people who work for the club. Obviously the suspension of the Championship season due to Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the recent fortunes of the club.”Watson told the PA news agency that people interested in buying the club had been in touch immediately after the announcement of the administration.IEC bought Wigan from the sports and retail magnate Dave Whelan for £15.9m, but despite winning promotion from League One last season, the company said it was dissatisfied with the loss-making finances of the Championship and the UK’s uncertain economic prospects after Brexit. IEC sold to Au Yeung’s consortium for £17.5m, plus repayment of £24.36m the company had invested in the club.Since buying the club the company said it sustained increases in players wages to £17.5m, from £10m in 2017-18, and sustained a £9m loss for the 13 months to 30 June last year. Whelan, the former Blackburn player who made his corporate fortune with the retail empire JJB Sports, bought Wigan, his local club, in 1995, building a stadium and funding a rise from League Two to eight years in the Premier League and winning the FA Cup in 2013, before relegation that same season and the decision to sell five years later. The chairman in 2018, his grandson David Sharpe, said at the time of selling to IEC that it was “a suitable owner with the funds and ambition to carry on the family legacy”.Whelan responded to the administration by saying he was “in total shock” and did not understand why the new owner had acted in this way. “I am going to have to see if I can help in any way, shape or form,” he told TalkSport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9c44de1e637c82db9a950f0a0ae57ac9939e6f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=413057466c4c410ac6e6cbfece64791b","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78be8775c2cde632fedec3818bb10c6b6a94bfc5/0_196_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0abc245992b0d2ce16c8f76bffd6ce5a","title":"ministers urged to limit facebook and google power over uk ad market","story":"CMA proposals include requiring Google to share data and making personalised ads optional in UKFacebook could be forced to allow users to switch off personalised advertising, and Google required to hand valuable data about search engine usage to competitors, under new UK proposals to introduce competition into the digital advertising market.In response, the CMA has recommended that the government creates a “Digital Markets Unit” with the power to force competition where none currently exists, by, for instance:The CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: “Through our examination of this market, we have discovered how major online platforms like Google and Facebook operate and how they use digital advertising to fuel their business models.“What we have found is concerning – if the market power of these firms goes unchecked, people and businesses will lose out,” he said. “People will carry on handing over more of their personal data than necessary, a lack of competition could mean higher prices for goods and services bought online and we could all miss out on the benefits of the next innovative digital platform.”The CMA’s concerns are due not just to the scale of Facebook and Google’s dominance of the online advertising market, but also the belief that the scale of the two companies allows them to effectively lock out competitors.Facebook, for instance, owns three social networks with more than a billion users each – Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - making it a “must-have” social network for people to remain in touch with each other. Google’s search engine, meanwhile, has substantially more users than other search engines, which means it receives more data about how people react to search results, which lets it improve its search results, which means it has more users.“We have not seen a significant challenge to the position of Google and Facebook for many years,” the report says, arguing that any one of their competitive advantages “would be substantial, but we have found they are mutually reinforcing and in combination provide an unassailable incumbency advantage.”The CMA has issued its recommendations a fortnight after the departure of its chairman, Andrew Tyrie, who said the role prevented him leading a more aggressive campaign for change.Ironically, the CMA’s report lands as Facebook deals with an unprecedented boycott from advertisers. On Wednesday, Lego and apparel company Vans announced they would take part in a month-long protest, coordinated by a coalition of US companies who are pushing Facebook to take more action to prevent hate speech on the site.In a statement, Ronan Harris, the vice-president of Google UK \u0026amp Ireland, said the company would “continue to work constructively with regulatory authorities and government on these important areas so that everyone can make the most of the web”.A Facebook spokesperson said: “Providing a free service, funded by advertising that is relevant and useful, gives millions of people and businesses in the UK the opportunity to connect and share. We face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes.“Giving people meaningful controls over how their data is collected and used is important, which is why we have introduced industry leading tools for people to control how their data is used to inform the ads they see. We’re also exploring new ways through which people can move their data to other services through our Data Transfer Project. We look forward to engaging with UK government bodies on rules that protect consumers and help small businesses rebuild as the British economy recovers.”The report was welcomed by consumer rights group Which?, whose director of advocacy, Rocio Concha, said: “It is positive to see the competition regulator pushing to give control back to consumers and address competition concerns.“People should be able to use these services without sacrificing their data for personalised advertising and consumers have told us they want an opt-in, rather than an opt-out, choice if they are to be targeted in this way.”The CMA has formed a joint body with the Information Commissioner’s Office and communications watchdog Ofcom, called the Digital Markets Taskforce, to examine “the functions, processes and powers” needed to promote competition online, and provide more detailed advice to the government about how the regulatory regime should work. That taskforce will deliver its report by the end of 2020.Both the taskforce report and the CMA report ultimately leave the choice to the government as to whether, and how, to legislate to adopt the recommendations. “To achieve this substantial package of reform, the necessary next step is for the government to pass legislation,” the report concludes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38eea919b7037d6508da057bf2e0b9890cf39c54/211_271_961_576/master/961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfebc76dccc56e0119675b93b79e49fd","title":"manga saint hilare grimes overlooked mc","story":"He felt lost and outclassed in the chart-topping Roll Deep crew alongside Wiley. But now the Londoner is making grime’s most honest, soul-searching tracksManga Saint Hilare should be out touring his new album Make It Out Alive but, like the rest of us, he’s at home using his time to learn new things. “I’ve been learning how to make beats, improving my Photoshop skills and designing Instagram filters for promotion,” he says. “Things that can help my ting, really.”He even jokes about jumping on TikTok and starting a career there – funny because at 34, the London rapper is now a lot older than the platform’s fresh-faced dancers and meme-slingers. While drill and Afro-swing are the current dominant sounds of UK rap, Manga belongs to a previous generation: the grime MCs who built their credibility earning reloads in raves, the likes of Dizzee Rascal and Kano who paved the way for Stormzy.He joined Roll Deep in 2004, the grime crew who crossed into pop for two UK No 1 singles in 2010, but he always considered himself an outsider and kept a low profile compared with other members such as Wiley. “One time I released a solo single and made £3.58 on iTunes, and this was proper digital downloads,” he says, self-deprecatingly. But being outside of the spotlight can pay more than financial idends. Despite – indeed, perhaps because of – grime not being in fashion as it once was, Manga has made Make It Out Alive one of the most brilliant UK rap releases this year. He sketches out a hopeful future, but references the doubts and difficulties he’s had along the way – this graceful and contemplative outlook is the album’s highlight.He says his 2019 album with rapper Murkage Dave, We Need to Look After Us, was about slowing down and looking inward, and Make It Out Alive continues this self examination – themes of wellbeing and self-care thread them together. “It’s about remaining grounded in everything you do and not allowing this world to kill you. Everyone’s issues vary depending on circumstances, but it’s about always keeping in motion.” Hence the moped on the cover.While many other MCs are world-makers with their lyrics and themes, there’s a feeling that, when you listen to Manga spit, he’s in conversation with his listeners, inviting them into his world to share his experience. “It’s my clearest project in terms of the message I’m trying to convey, and I’m happy that people are collectively understanding,” he says. Even on the more explosive tracks such as Trample, the sharpness in his tone makes it feel like he’s speaking directly to you: “First things first, let me say from now we are not similar  I am not like dem,” he raps. And so it proves: whether fretting about the grim financial realities of an independent artist on Less Money More Problems or struggling with bouts of depression on Escape Plan, he touches on topics other MCs sometimes shy away from. His writing is purposeful, precise and often funny, and each word has its place as he challenges the idea of a single narrative within grime.As he says on Black Man Timing, “not giving a fuck is my skincare routine”, but this clarity of purpose came out of a long stretch in the wilderness. “I felt lost for a long time – there wasn’t any direction in my life,” he says. As one of the younger members of Roll Deep alongside some big personalities, he arguably joined ahead of his time – too early, in fact. “There are people like Wiley who just get it and have that energy. But I was lost in every area of life and I didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn’t earning anything really, I wasn’t making any impact, but at the same time I wasn’t doing enough. I wasn’t very good, and sometimes I wondered whether I should’ve got a job. It was a struggle back then. As I got older, I learned more about myself.”Each project since has encapsulated each stage in his life, gradually adding more detail to an overall portrait of a man. “I have the room to talk about my fears and insecurities about finding my place in the world,” he says. “There’s no extra songs recorded when I make a body of work – the first line you heard is the first thing I wrote, and it’s the same with the last. Everything in that project is me. That’s why I feel it’s sick when people tell me they like certain songs, it’s like there’s an understanding on a deeper level.”Manga’s name as a solo artist has only blown up in the last five years or so, following those years he spent figuring out what kind of MC he wanted to be. His golden age could unexpectedly come in his mid-30s. “I just wanted to tell my story and now people have gravitated towards me, from me being myself,” he says. “I’ve got nothing to pretend about any more. I’ve learned more about myself and the more I speak about the realities, the more people see me as Manga and not just a grime MC. I don’t have to play a character.” Grime’s wallflower will continue to blossom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites.

He said the council finally had a complete picture of where positive cases have been reported in Oldham and “it shows we are some considerable distance behind Leicester (with others above us).”We can’t relax because it’s right that we are high, relatively speaking, but Leicester seems to be something of an outlier.The Greater Manchester combined authority released its infection figures today, showing what while there had been 135 cases in Leicester per 100,000 people over the last seven days, with numbers increasing, in Greater Manchester there were 13.3 and falling. Of the ten local authorities in Greater Manchester, Rochdale has the highest rate, with 28.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared with 27.8 in Oldham.The government has not yet got an answer as to whether it met its target of returning the vast majority of coronavirus tests within 24 hours, as Boris Johnson promised would happen by the end of June. (See 10.13am.) In fact, we learned on the regular No 10 lobby media conference call, we won’t know for another week.The first statistics on the number of tests completed within 24 hours will come out on Thursday as part of the weekly test and trace statistics, and will then be updated every week. However, this first batch will cover the period of 18-24 June. We will thus have to wait another seven days for the 30 June figure.Asked whether even he knew if the target had been met, Johnson’s spokesman said: “I don’t, no.”A sceptic might say that No 10 will at least have some idea, and if it looked like the 24-hour target had been reached, news would get out sooner. But time will tell.He says that is why mass testing is so important.He says “saturation testing” in hospitals should be an absolute requirement.Back in the science committee Kate Bingham, chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, tells MPs that Oxford University’s coronavirus vaccine is ahead of any other in the world.At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman defended the way coronavirus testing information had been shared with local authorities. He said:Since April detailed local data has been shared by Public Health England with local areas. And since June 11 an operational data dashboard was made available by NHS Digital which includes counts of local tests, total positives and test and trace data - it’s to give local authorities a clear picture of the stats in their local area, it was provided to support directors of public health and councils.Last week we started securely sharing postcode-level testing data with all local authorities including Leicester and that data is available to them at any time.The UK has enough stocks of the drug remdesivir, the Department of Health has confirmed, after the US bought nearly all the manufacturing stock for the next three months.

Only images taken at one wavelength, 17.1 nanometres, were used in the video, with the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of the images allowing for the sun’s golden yellow, outermost atmospheric layer – the corona – to be visible.Nasa commissioned German musician Lars Leonhard to compose Solar Observe to accompany the video.In a statement released with the video, Nasa explained why there were a few blank frames in the video and the infrequent changes of focus away from the sun.“While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed toward the sun, there have been a few moments it missed,” it said. “The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun.”Nasa also explained that a “longer blackout” in the footage in 2016 was caused by a temporary AIA instrument issue that took a week to fix.“The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments,” Nasa said.The SDO mission is expected to continue observing the sun until 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a87b88ec22cca1263511ec105f1900d7cfbd22c0/0_54_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8f55b64935f3d146b1a143d3522e73a7","title":"hes a leader of men bayliss spotted stokess captaincy potential early","story":"Ben Stokes has been described as “a leader of men” by Trevor Bayliss, who long saw the all-rounder as captaincy material during his time as the England head coach due to a magnetic presence in the dressing room.Bayliss spent the best part of five years helping to guide Stokes’s ascent before returning to Australia last September and raised an eyebrow when reading that, with Joe Root down to miss next week’s first Test against West Indies for paternity leave, a new England captain was needed.There was little doubt Stokes, restored to the vice-captaincy before last summer’s Ashes heroics, would step up here, but it still took Bayliss back to one of the first times he tipped the younger, fierier version for the top job - and the reaction this prediction received.Speaking to the  for an upcoming interview about the first anniversary of England’s World Cup victory last summer, Bayliss said: “I think it was after we lost to Bangladesh in Chittagong in late 2016 and there was conjecture around whether Alastair Cook would continue.“The topic came up in my press conference and a lot of the talk was around Rooty taking over. He was the obvious replacement, as the vice-captain at the time. Then someone asked me, ‘Is there anyone else?’“I put Stokesy’s name out there and everyone laughed. I was like ‘no, mate, I’m serious.’ He’s like Eoin Morgan in that he’s a leader of men and when he talks, everyone listens. They’re just drawn to him.“The standing that other players hold him in, that’s half the battle. Whether you make the right or wrong decision, if your players believe you and have confidence in you – which I’m pretty sure they have – they’ll follow.”Bayliss described Stokes as the “ideal” vice-captain to Root as the pair plan towards the next Ashes series in 2021-22 but said he is the type of character who would “find a way of handling it” should the top job come around.As regards some of the additional off-field demands that may have weighed down others in the past, Bayliss said this confidence stems from two examples.Perhaps the greatest unknown is how Stokes will balance captaincy with his on-field duties as an all-rounder, in particular with the ball. In his press conference on Monday, the 29-year-old said he will ask himself what Root would want in the same situation but admitted only time will tell.“But I think he’ll do a good job. I would expect him to be a fairly proactive captain and very positive. And whatever happens, it will certainly be interesting to sit back and watch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4729e58f1feab0c061a46ebf534131332b245fe/0_171_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9e75ae84a87a4451cee1fef1825df5","title":"leicester race meeting next week in balance as city stays in lockdown horse racing","story":"Having staged one race meeting amid a local lockdown on Tuesday, the chance that Leicester will do so again will hang in the balance until Friday, after the British Horseracing Authority said it will “have further discussions with the relevant authorities” before deciding whether the card can take place.Tuesday’s meeting at Leicester, with a first race at 4.40pm, did not get the all-clear to proceed until late on Tuesday morning, when many runners were already on their way to the track. Several trainers withdrew their intended starters – a dozen non-runners were reported to be due to “travel problems” or “other” – while the meeting also took place without starting stalls after just four of the expected 11 stalls handlers reported for duty.Ragged starts and the slew of non-runners led to a sense that Tuesday’s meeting was limping towards the finishing line, and having had little time in which to decide whether to go ahead after Hancock’s announcement, the BHA will seek further advice from stakeholders as well as local health officials before making a call on next Tuesday’s card.“Yesterday’s race meeting was held with the approval of the local authority and Public Health England,” a BHA spokesperson said on Wednesday, “under the strict protocols agreed in advance with the resumption of sport behind closed doors. The lockdown effectively reinstated restrictions as they were on 14 June, in the view of local officials, when racing was permitted in accordance with UK government guidelines.”While the decision to go ahead may not have breached the letter of the reimposed restrictions, however, some trainers – and a majority of the stalls handlers – clearly felt that it did not accord with the spirit or intention of the move. Graeme McPherson, who scratched his intended runner Homing Star from the 8.15pm race, said that he had been “frankly astounded that the BHA considered it appropriate to race”, adding that he could not “believe that the public will perceive racing to be doing the right thing”.As a result, and in view of the distinct possibility that further local lockdowns will be imposed in other areas in the weeks ahead, the BHA will “speak to representative bodies within the industry” in the hope of establishing a procedure should further lockdowns arise at short notice.Areas of the country which have been reported as having rising rates of Covid-19 infection include York, which is due to stage its first meeting of the year next Thursday, as well as Doncaster and Redcar, which have both held meetings since the resumption of racing on 1 June. However, Sharon Stoltz, the City of York council’s director of public health, said on Wednesday that the city “currently has relatively low numbers of cases of Covid-19 and a local lockdown is certainly not necessary”, adding, “there is no evidence to suggest that cases are increasing in York”.Entries are being taken as normal for next Tuesday’s card at Leicester, and a decision will be taken “by lunchtime on Friday” on whether it can go ahead. “Given that the local lockdown measures may still be evolving, it’s important that dialogue continues ahead of any future events in Leicester,” the BHA spokesperson said. “Our industry colleagues will be briefed on this dialogue and will consider any potential impacts on racing. Our focus continues to be on making sure racing behind closed doors takes place as safely as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73134cfbb2e1828285b2a986745c190d6c02aef/134_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00aec61a3a4ef70804d07b62a6d3902","title":"germanys new sculpture garden the perfect post lockdown attraction","story":" A contemporary art collection in the grounds of a castle north-west of Berlin is a bold addition for a quiet part of BrandenburgDr Loretta Würtenberger – tall and clad in a flowing black summer dress – greets me with a casual coronavirus-style elbow-bump on the grounds of her new home, Schlossgut Schwante: an 18th-century baroque castle she bought with her husband Daniel Tümpel last year. Both well-established in the art market, the couple have transformed the castle grounds into a sculpture park featuring works by German and international artists, such as Tony Cragg, Maria Loboda, Dan Graham, Hans Arp, and Carsten Nicolai.It’s a bold, perhaps even radical, new attraction for this sleepy part of the Brandenburg region, around 25km north-west of Berlin, and an ideal post-lockdown cultural destination. Alongside the sculpture park, the couple have created a restaurant with a rustic, intimate interior, a large patio with an outdoor kitchen and a quaint wagon selling artisanal ice-cream. A farm shop sells handmade crockery, art books, cookbooks and local produce perfect for on-site picnics. An events programme includes open-air film screenings, outdoor yoga classes, concerts and lectures.“If someone had told me 18 months ago that I would be doing all this, and having this conversation with you right now, I would have said they were crazy,” says Loretta as she leads me through the restaurant and into the park. “We bought it from a friend, with no real intention of creating a sculpture park. But we wanted to maintain the house as the centre of a dynamic entity rather than a scenic backdrop. Since there’s no big agriculture here any more, and we are not farmers, art was the answer.”The baroque main building, which now serves as a private home for the couple and their four children, is said to have been designed by fabulously named Georg Wenceslas von Knobelsdorff, one of Frederick the Great’s favoured architects. It was constructed in the early 1740s for the von Redern family, generations of whom lived here until the 1880s. The vicissitudes of 20th-century Germany saw it used as a hospital and a DDR kindergarten.The garden is the estate’s pièce de résistance, though. Originally designed in the English style popular at the time, it now combines landscaped and wilded sections dotted with fruit trees (cherries, plums, apples), as well as pendulous willows, proud (and fragrant) linden trees – and more than 20 international artworks placed up trees, in ponds, and semi-hidden within thickets.It’s a fun way to enjoy art, and some pieces are additionally interactive, such as Dan Graham’s 2018 Play Pen for Play Pals, which combines stainless steel, glass and a two-way mirror to allow the viewer to merge, ghost-like, with the surroundings, and Carsten Nicolai’s cast-iron sound installation Echo, which mimics a meditation temple, encouraging visitors to thump their chests and listen for the reverberation from different places.A stainless steel corkscrew-style sculpture in a field turns out to be a 2012 work by Tony Cragg, whose own sculpture park near Wuppertal is perhaps the only similar project to this one in Germany. A small field of aluminium flowers that shimmy and chime with the wind and rain is by Berlin-based Japanese artist Toshihiko Mitsuya, who comes each week to clip the grass and plant new flowers. A much-darker note is struck by Polish artist Monika Sosnowska’s Stairs 2019, a crumpled black staircase that lies in the grass like a malevolent bug.But overall the park is a welcoming and graceful place, embellished with strategically placed Sissinghurst benches (with graceful arched backs), hammocks strung between trees, and a circular hedged area with a small pond and several day beds.“It’s about creating a space where art has no barrier,” says Loretta. “It’s not a white cube. It’s something where nature and art merges and families can come and enjoy.” Since opening, the site has drawn hundreds of visitors, including many families, a positive surprise for the owners, especially during these difficult times. On the way out, I spy another artwork rising from the lake – a neon sign by Martin Creed that reads Everything Is Going To Be Alright. Under normal circumstances it might seem a little trite, but as the world continues to grapple with a pandemic, it feels strangely comforting.• The Sculpture and Nature exhibition runs until 31 October.

In May, Washington began limiting visas for Chinese journalists to a renewable 90-day period after the expulsion of at least 13 American journalists from three US papers.The expulsion of the journalists from the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal came after a US decision in March to treat five Chinese state media outlets as foreign missions.Chinese authorities previously expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters from its Beijing bureau over what China said was a racist column published in a separate editorial section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beecf7e521c8d61fbbada37c27fb31ee966c5a07/0_152_4563_2738/master/4563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6de52c82d1a6e5d0b0f02e3dc4e2c495","title":"coronavirus victoria 73 new covid 19 cases reported as 36 melbourne suburbs return to lockdown","story":"Ten hotspot postcodes face restrictions from midnight, as surge in community transmission sees state ramp up containment measuresVictoria reported 73 new Covid-19 cases overnight, with 10 hotspot postcodes to enter lockdown from midnight as the state tries to bring the cases under control.While there were 14 new cases announced in New South Wales overnight, all of those were in returned international travellers now in quarantine hotels. Of Victoria’s cases, only three were from hotel quarantine, with community transmission becoming a growing concern in the state over the past fortnight. The source of 42 of Victoria’s newest cases remains under investigation.The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Wednesday that the work of public health officials door-knocking the most affected suburbs and offering people free testing was now a key part of the state’s strategy to bring the spread under control.“I can report to you that as of last night we had knocked on some 54,000 doors in those high-risk suburbs and postcodes offering advice, testing information and in some cases the self-administering test kits where people can take the test and it can be collected at a later point,” he said. “There will be further door-knocking, quite intensive door-knocking and there will be an update to this end each and every day.”Maidstone and Broadmeadows are the focus of this door-knocking on Wednesday, with and Albanvale and Brunswick West to be targeted on Thursday. Twelve new testing sites will be established across the 10 hotspot postcodes, which include 36 suburbs, facing lockdown.“In terms of those lockdown suburbs I again make the point I know and understand that this will be deeply inconvenient,” Andrews said. “It will be frustrating, it will be very challenging. We will be there to support each and every business that’s impacted, not just with within the zone but also the tourism businesses where there will be bookings that will have to be cancelled because of these lockdowns.”He said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, supported the measures, including the ersion of international flights to other states after breaches were identified in infection control in Victoria’s hotel quarantine program. Further announcements were expected on Wednesday afternoon about support for affected businesses, as well as how the lockdowns will be enforced.“Ultimately, if I didn’t shut down those postcodes I’d be shutting down all postcodes and I don’t think we want to get to that point,” Andrews said. “We all want to work hard, literally day and night to try and avoid that sort of an outcome.”It comes as the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced any Victorian from one of the hotspot suburbs entering NSW faces fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ jail. Residents from his state face the same penalties if they go to one of the 36 suburbs.“Victorians living in virus hotspots have to take the Victorian and NSW health orders seriously and should be very aware that NSW will impose additional penalties if they seek to leave their suburbs to enter NSW,” he said.NSW has further eased its social distancing restrictions from Wednesday, with limits on attendance for funerals, weddings, places of worship and community sport relaxed as long as there is no more than one person for every 4 sq m of space.Outdoor gatherings are still restricted to 20 people but community sport with a Covid-19 safety plan can have up to 500 participants. Funerals, weddings and church services may have the maximum number of people allowed on the premises, with one person for every 4 square metres. All businesses can now open and operate under the same principle.The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, reiterated on Wednesday that the states borders were reopening from 10 July except to Victorians.Of the new cases identified in Victoria overnight, five additional staff members have been linked to the outbreak at Al Taqwa College in Truganina, taking the total to eight staff at the school. The cases are linked to previous outbreaks in Sunshine West and Truganina.Two new cases are part of the Stamford Plaza Hotel outbreak where returned travellers are being kept in quarantine, taking the total to 31. One is a security guard in quarantine and the other is a household contact of a confirmed case. On Tuesday Andrews said a number of Victoria’s cases through late May and early June had been linked through genomic testing to an infection control breach in the hotel quarantine program, prompting him to call for a judicial inquiry.Victoria’s chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said: “This virus is not selective”.“It will impact anyone it encounters, and personal contact is the clear source of its transmission.” He said for people living in hotspots, “There is no excuse for not getting tested”. From midnight, for people living outside the restricted postcodes, there are only four reasons to go into those postcodes will be shopping for food and supplies, care and caregiving, exercise and study or work. People who live in these postcodes cannot have visitors to their home, or visit other homes, except for caregiving or compassionate reasons, or receiving services.Businesses and facilities in these postcodes that have reopened will again be restricted. Cafes and restaurants will only be able to open for take-away and delivery services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5ccccc1d87c0e13a6cfb1158a8d61a358bf261/0_48_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591bb57dc325cbd4b7c29a2e1c0a13a3","title":"data reveals coronavirus hotspots in bradford barnsley and rochdale","story":"Exclusive: figures reveal locations with highest levels of new infections after LeicesterBradford, Barnsley and Rochdale can be revealed as the places with the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester, as fears grow of further local outbreaks and the UK heads towards Saturday’s lifting of more lockdown restrictions.The official data, which has not been previously published on Public Health England’s online dashboard, comes amid complaints from local health officials and medics that a lack of detailed testing about local outbreaks is causing delays in attempts to curtail them.It also raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities, with seven out of 10 of the worst affected areas being in Yorkshire and Lancashire, including some of the most ethnically erse parts of the country.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country. Figures from Public Health England now show that rate was even higher in the east Midlands city – just over 140 – in the week ending the previous Sunday, 21 June.Bradford’s rate for that week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures, which gather together both tests primarily in NHS settings and of healthcare workers and tests carried out in people’s homes and in the community.The two strands are known as pillar-one and pillar-two testing.However, only the pillar-one testing is used in PHE’s online coronavirus dashboard, meaning that the majority of cases in the worst-hit areas are being left off this data. This data did not show that as far back as the week beginning 1 June, PHE knew Leicester was among the two worst affected areas in England.The Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”Local public health officials and medics have complained that the government has not supplied sufficiently detailed information on local infections, the lack of which they say hampers attempts to quash new outbreaks.Councils have been promised postcode-level data for weeks from Public Health England and the newly created Joint Biosecurity Centre. But some public health directors are concerned the centre has not been sharing data about potential clusters of infections with councils, which could enforce school or workplace closures that could suppress an outbreak at an early stage.“If the only data you’re getting is ‘in this population of 90,000 people there are 40 positives’ it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. If Leicester had got the data sooner they could have had a fighting chance of managing it,” said one public health director, who asked not to be named.The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible. This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world-leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.”The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has been “working closely with our local partners, providing them with the resources and tools so that they can take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection”.In total, there are 47 English local authorities where there are more than 10 cases per 100,000. In a further sign that the disease has shifted away from the capital, not one of these 47 areas was in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ed8a138798093680bba331991bd017dde0b5a4/0_12_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a28cd10aa5e5e2353a4c9f87bed5be2","title":"englands roads set for busiest weekend of the year as lockdown eased","story":"A third of motorists planning to go away for an overnight stay, finds RAC pollRoads in England could be at their busiest of the year this weekend as lockdown restrictions are further eased on Saturday.From 4 July, people in the country will be allowed to spend the night away from their household for the first time since lockdown came into force on 23 March, permitting overnight stays with relatives and friends as well as staycations, bookings for which have surged in the last week.Last week roads were gridlocked in Bournemouth and a major incident was declared when tens of thousands flocked to the beach. Police also closed the main road to Camber Sands beach in East Sussex after a mile-long queue for a car park formed. Some popular tourist hotspots including St Ives in Cornwall have already taken steps to ban cars and close roads to avoid overcrowding and encourage social distancing.On Saturday, gatherings of two different households will be allowed indoors and overnight stays permitted, providing physical distancing is maintained.The 2-metre distancing rule will also be reduced to 1-metre and businesses including pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, barbers, leisure facilities and theme parks can reopen and weddings of up to 30 guests can take place – as long as “Covid-secure” measures are in place.RAC Breakdown spokesperson Rod Dennis said: “These figures suggest that after 15 weeks of lockdown, a large proportion of drivers in England are desperate to reconnect with friends, family and indeed nature by staying overnight, be that in a house or on a camping or caravan site.“This could lead to some busy conditions on the roads, with the location of queues likely to be dependent on just how far people travel. Motorways and major A-roads could end up taking the brunt of the traffic if people have longer distances to drive to see family and friends or to take a weekend break.”Figures show a clear rise in road traffic in recent weeks and the number of motorists breaking down beginning to approach normal levels. However, the AA said this was partly down to cars having been on driveways for weeks, and that, while it was increasing breakdown resources in preparations for “Super Saturday”, it did not necessarily expect to see the level of road chaos feared.“Although a huge number of people went down to Bournemouth mainly from London, Kent and Essex for a day trip, it doesn’t necessarily follow that a third of the UK car-owning population is going to go on overnight stays and holidays on Saturday night,” an AA spokesman said.He said factors including the weather and the reopening of pubs and restaurants, as well as the local lockdown in Leicester, would all influence whether people “celebrated” the easing of restrictions more locally or by travelling further afield.“A lot of people will look at Leicester and wonder whether they still need to be careful, and they will have also been put off by the Bournemouth and Southend experience. That will persuade a lot of potential travellers to hang back and see how things go.“But at this stage, nobody can really calculate to what extent people will hold back. The question is, has Leicester been a wake-up call?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e574c49e8d69db0f7045d6a648b257148a89d8a/0_36_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da94facb0b2583ad69931d6aeb4f3773","title":"highlands community anxious scotland gears up for tourism coronavirus","story":"Influx of potentially infectious visitors worries local people relatively unscathed by coronavirusScotland’s national bard Robert Burns wrote that the Highland welcome was such that he’d ask no more on entering heaven.But with only 114 coronavirus deaths to date, residents of this vast area – which swiftly isolated in March – are equivocal about an influx of visitors as the Scottish tourism sector reopens on 15 July.The homemade “tourists go home” signs that appeared at the start of lockdown to deter isolation tourists may have been removed, but Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, this week acknowledged she could not rule out quarantining or screening travellers from England if infection rates rise south of the border.While tourism bosses warn of threatened cancellations, the  has spoken to residents, businesses and community leaders across the Highlands, whose anxiety and ambivalence is palpable.Joyce Campbell, a hill farmer in Armadale, on the far north coast, has been busy clipping sheep in between the rainstorms this week, but summarises the local mood succinctly: “Safe to say that there’s a lot of mixed emotions on the lifting of lockdown in parts of the Highlands. Many businesses are heavily reliant on tourism income, but really aware of the increased risk that more visitors from outside the area bring to our communities.”Reflecting on an already growing surge of visitors – including a camper van stationed in the car park of the local doctor’s surgery in the remote village of Ballachulish where he lives – Highland councillor Niall McLean is blunt: “This area got off lightly during lockdown, but that makes opening up even more worrying. It was the local communities that kept themselves safe and supported each other, and they don’t want to risk their health, and possibly lives, for economic gain.”With many toilets, car parks and other facilities still closed, tourists will have to step up their efforts to travel respectfully and clear up their own mess, he says. “Local people just want to see visitors who are trying their best.”For those living along the North Coast 500, which is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year, lockdown has provided time to reflect on the impact of the popular touring route, which has also become notorious for camper van jams and straining basic infrastructure.While one of the main appeals of the route was to provide local jobs for young people, many of those working along it were from other, poorer parts of Europe and were sent home by employers at the start of lockdown, to the disappointment of residents who hoped they would work for a season and then stay.An influx of potentially infectious tourists is of significant concern for local medics too. Iain Kennedy, a Highland GP and north of Scotland BMA representative, says practitioners are particularly worried about the situation were a visitor develops symptoms, and how to apply clinical advice from the test, trace, isolate scheme to a tourist who can’t access a swab because they are travelling around, or may not unable to remain in one place because their booking has expired.“Visitors will be very visible to communities, and it’s important that they are aware of that and scrupulous in the way they behave,” Kennedy added. “People in the Highlands are very concerned by what they have seen in Bournemouth and elsewhere, with people behaving as if the virus has gone.”Frazer Coupland, head of Lochaber Chamber of Commerce, has spent the past few days ringing his 220 members based across Fort William, Glencoe and Loch Ness, and is struck by how many of them – while desperate to restart for the obvious economic imperatives – are choosing to wait until August so they can observe the initial impact of opening up on the area.He also suggests that a hefty rise in bookings for outdoor activities providers may indicate a more responsible approach from visitors. “More people are booking organised trips, walking or kayaking, because at this time they don’t want to be that person who calls out mountain rescue.”For Tanja Lister, owner of the Kylesku hotel, which perches on a wild Sutherland peninsula, the sense of responsibility as she reopens to guests – for visitors, her team and the wider community – is “huge”, she says. “It’s a natural reaction for people to be fearful when we haven’t had any new cases locally for weeks, but the alternative is to make 20 people redundant and I’m not prepared to do that without giving it a go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16cbdc3ef1cab58e43f5ff1caf3badd3ad80d381/0_109_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba8cb664b43fa1337b4df0b076dfe9f4","title":"mexico coronavirus doctor lungs scepticism","story":"Dr Iván Cruz wanted to shock people out of pandemic scepticism with X-rays of his coronavirus-scarred lungsThe images of Iván Cruz’s lungs resemble a dust cloud in outer space: light patches enveloped by the gloom.Before he died in hospital, the young Mexican doctor had intended to publish them online to convince the unbelievers: coronavirus exists, and this is what it does to you.“It makes you feel impotent and angry not to be able to grab people and tell them: ‘Don’t you get it?’” said Agileo Cruz, the father of the 28-year-old Mexican doctor, who died from Covid-19-related complications last month.Mexico is now one of the countries worst-hit by Covid-19, with more than 220,000 reported infections and 27,000 dead, the seventh-highest death toll on Earth.In late April, with only 1,351 fatalities, the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, claimed the pandemic had been “tamed”. But on Saturday Mexico recorded 602 deaths, the highest number anywhere in the world that day.Despite the growing tragedy, some in Mexico continue to doubt the virus’s very existence, taking no precautions and insisting that the epidemic is little but a government invention.In the central state of Puebla a family of traders attacked civil protection officials who asked them to wear masks.In southern Chiapas, residents of one town torched a hospital and beat up doctors in an attempt to halt mosquito fumigation teams they accused of deliberately spreading Covid-19.In Ecatepec, a city near Mexico’s capital, relatives forced their way into a hospital claiming coronavirus did not exist and accusing doctors of killing their loved ones.Mexico’s coronavirus tsar, Hugo López-Gatell, has blamed such behaviour on disinformation. “It strikes me as extraordinary that accurate information is not reaching everyone or that, if this information is reaching them, there are still people who don’t consider Covid a serious epidemic,” the deputy health minister said during one of his nightly television appearances detailing the advance of the illness.But many also point the finger at those in power, including López Obrador, a leftwing populist, who has minimized the threat of Covid-19, has never been seen in a face mask – and on Sunday said he had never taken a coronavirus test, despite the fact that several senior government officials have tested positive.“Who is to blame … when there are world leaders who have played down the impact of this virus from the very beginning?” asked the journalist and commentator José Luis Arévalo.“It’s not just our president … but Donald Trump in the US too, Vladimir Putin in Russia and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil – precisely the countries where the highest number of infections and deaths are being recorded,” Arévalo told ForoTV.“The fact is, the messages of these leaders have been a key factor in leading people to dismiss this disease.”The historian Lorenzo Meyer told Aristegui Noticias he believed coronavirus scepticism in Mexico was partly the consequence of a centuries-old resistance to authorities that stemmed back to colonial times and had intensified in more recent years as a result of abuses committed by the police and armed forces.Cruz’s father said that in Chiapas state, where his son lived and died, many remained doubtful and were doing little to protect themselves. “People only believe in the virus when it affects their family – when they see pictures or names,” he said.His son, who worked in a private clinic in the city of Comitán, knew the dangers all too well but resisted abandoning his job out of devotion to his patients. “He had a gift,” his father remembered. “He loved his profession.”In May, as Covid-19 swept through Latin America, Cruz urged his son to stop working and take shelter in the state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, where the family is from. But the doctor held out until he could go on no more. “The virus has got me,” he admitted to his father one Sunday in late May.X-rays showed that by then Cruz’s lungs had been severely damaged. After testing positive he spent three days at home before being taken to hospital, where he died on 1 June.“I left him at the hospital and I never saw him again,” said his father ,who was later diagnosed with the illness himself and remains in isolation.In one of their last encounters, Cruz’s father remembered his son clutching his radiographs and telling him: “I’m going to post them on Facebook to try and convince those who don’t believe this virus exists.”“He wasn’t able to do this, so I published them for him,” said his father, his breathing ragged and his voice breaking with emotion.In a post on social media, the 53-year-old civil servant and the mother of his son, Maribel Antonio García, said they hoped the images would shock Mexicans into not underestimating the pandemic.“Today we’re asking you, if you’re one of those people who still don’t believe, to inform yourselves … and help to stop the spread of this virus. Covid is aggressive, invasive and it attacks you – physically and mentally,” they wrote.If the images of their son’s lungs told a clear story, the impact on their family was impossible to convey.“We cannot describe to you the pain in the face of our son, because the words don’t exist,” they said, before concluding with a homage to their lost boy.“Rest in peace,” they wrote. “Dr Iván Cruz. Son, brother, grandson, cousin, nephew, friend – but above all a great human being.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

Such seesawing lockdowns could be largely avoided, experts say, if Americans embraced near-universal mask wearing.“Masks are incredibly important,” said Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health. “The airborne transmission of the virus is increasingly of concern and masks are an effective way to prevent that. The more we learn about this virus, the more I’m encouraging people to wear masks.”Pollitt said she had had a positive response from schools in Connecticut to her urgings to wear masks but added “definitely a cultural shift” was needed for Americans to fully embrace them.A third of Americans say they only sometimes or never wear a mask when in stores or other businesses, with strong partisan and racial ides: white people and Republicans are far less likely to wear masks than Democrats and black, Latino and Asian people.This is in stark difference to countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, which managed to avoid economically harmful lockdowns due, in part, to a willingness to wear masks.Hong Kong, with 7.5 million people, is a densely populated place that experienced huge numbers of travelers from mainland China, where Covid-19 originated, before border restrictions were put in place on 30 January. Only six coronavirus deaths have been recorded there.“The only thing you can do is universal masking, that’s what stopped it,” he told the Wall Street Journal.In the US, the CDC initially advised healthy people against wearing a mask, a stance driven by concerns over shortages of the N95 respirators.“At that time, there was a paucity of equipment that our healthcare providers needed, who put themselves daily in harm’s way of taking care of people who are ill,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, told Congress last week.As more was learned about the virus, however, it became clear that not only is it at least twice as infectious as the common flu but it can also be spread by people who are asymptomatic. The CDC now advises people to wear a mask in public, with at least 16 states and the District of Columbia mandating their use.Mass adoption of mask wearing has been undermined, however, by Donald Trump’s insistence on not wearing one in public, even removing a mask during a factory tour so the media wouldn’t picture him in it. On Tuesday, the Fox \u0026amp Friends host Steve Doocey sought to convince the Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, and House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, that Trump should cover up, and thereby show supporters “Masks are Great Again”. Neither seemed convinced.Mike Pence has also declined to wear a mask, even during hospital visits, as well as during a press conference last week where the vice-president hailed the “truly remarkable progress” of the US as it approached 130,000 deaths from Covid-19.The parlous situation in the US could have been headed off had there been an early, strong push towards mask wearing, experts say.“Trump could’ve worn a mask for four weeks, asked people on the other side of the aisle to do the same and you’d get a dramatic reduction in the infection rate and start to operate very close to normal again,” said Andy Slavitt, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid during Barack Obama’s administration. “He can’t do the little bit of sacrifice to see it through.”Instead, mask wearing has become, in some quarters, another cultural battleground in the US. In Palm Beach county in Florida, which is now fining people $250 for not wearing a mask, a public feedback forum last week featured residents falsely claiming that masks kill people, that they impede “God’s wonderful breathing system” and that they are a politically motivated tool designed to kill off freedoms."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292954.1593545107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"next year s leaving cert students need latitude after school closures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘It could mean giving students more options in the exam and not making every aspect of the exam compulsory.’ Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Education authorities are being urged to give next year’s Leaving Cert students a greater choice of questions in the exams to help make up for lost teaching time.Teachers’ unions have warned some schools will struggle to complete the curriculum by the end of next year due to school closures and say students should be given greater flexibility in light of this.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the State’s advisory body on the curriculum, is examining Leaving Cert subjects to identify whether changes may be needed in light of disruption caused by Covid-19.Séamus Laharte, president of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland, said a “common sense” solution involved providing more flexibility for students at exam time.“Sixth year is going to be a crammed year with mocks, orals, aurals and second components in 25 subjects. If a school is behind on the curriculum, it will put students under added pressure,” Mr Laharte said.“Teachers have worked hard to keep education going, there have been inevitable constraints and completing the full curriculum may be too big an ask this year.“The common-sense approach is to give students’ more latitude in the exams on the understanding that everyone will have, for example, 80 per cent of the curriculum covered. That could mean giving students more options in the exam and not making every aspect of the exam compulsory.”Robust examsDeirdre McDonald, Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland (ASTI) president, said next year’s Leaving Cert exams should be tailored by taking into account students’ learning experiences, while ensuring the exams are as robust as ever.“This work needs to be completed well in advance of the commencement of the next school year. It must also be flexible and take into account the conditions, as yet unknown, under which the return to school happens,” she said.The Irish Second Level Students’ Union supported calls for exams to be adapted to ensure students do not have the added pressures of having to catch up on months of missed coursework.Union president Reuban Murray said mental health and career guidance would also be a key challenge for schools and called for funding for guidance counsellor posts to be fully restored.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293603.1593614238!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i wouldn t fly if i didn t think it was safe says passenger boarding flight at dublin airport","story":"People are flying again from Irish airports, but in small numbers. There are 200 flights in and out of Dublin Airport today. This time last year that figure was approximately 800. Video: Bryan O\u0027BrienDublin Airport’s Terminal One began to show the first signs of a return to normal on Wednesday, with queues, passengers struggling to work the Ryanair self-check in kiosks, and hair pulling over missed flights.When the country went into lockdown in March the airport was like a ghost town, with only a tiny number of repatriation flights arriving to bring Irish citizens home from abroad.At 9am on Wednesday there was a small but steady trickle through the departure gates, with flights heading off to Malaga, La Rochelle, Alicante, Amsterdam, and Toulouse.Luke Parnell from Ballyfermot, Dublin, was part of a group of young lads heading to Amsterdam for three days. The 26-year-old said he was sick of being “locked up the last four months” and as other restrictions eased he decided to “just get on it” and book a holiday.Mr Parnell and two others missed their flight on Wednesday morning and had to book a second one in the airport.None of the three were wearing face masks, and Mr Parnell said he had two masks but had lost them. “I’ll be renting out my pushbike and that’ll be it. I’m mad into my sightseeing and my cycling, you know what I mean,” he said.Alan Hill, his partner and their two young children Johnny and Hannah were catching a flight to Toulouse, France.From Lisburn, Northern Ireland, the family will be in France for 12 days, and were “pretty excited to get on a holiday,” he said.“I wouldn’t fly if I didn’t think it was safe, the airlines and the airport will do their best to keep it as safe as they can,” he said.Working in retail during the pandemic Mr Hill said he was “ready for a break.” The two young children had been at home for the past four months, “so they’re ready for a change of scenery,” he said.There are 960 hand sanitiser dispensers in the airport, 620 flexiglass screens at touch points, and 10,000 pieces of signage and regular announcements advising people to adhere to social distancing guidelines.Paul O’Kane, head of communications for the DAA, said 4,000 passengers came through Dublin Airport on Monday, between departures and arrivals. This would compare to 116,000 passengers on the same day last year.“There has been an increase in flights today, you’ve seen Ryanair add a significant number of new services today . . . but the numbers are still going to be very very low,” he said.“Aviation always recovers, it recovered after 911, after Sars, after the oil crisis in the 70s, after the last recession,” he said.“If someone decides that they do want to travel we’re going to make their journey as smooth as we can and protect them at every step of the way,” he said.Dr Tony Holohan, the State’s chief medical officer, has warned of the risk of foreign travel importing new Covid-19 cases into Ireland. He has advised people who have booked overseas trips to not travel at present, due to the risk to themselves, their families and wider society.The Department of Foreign Affairs travel advice remains that people should avoid non-essential travel overseas.Many of those making their way through departures were on flights from Britain connecting through Dublin, and immigrants travelling home for the first time in months.Paola Invernizzi (28) was flying to Milan to visit her family who she has not seen in 11 months.“Of course it is a difficult situation, where I fly it is a little bit dangerous because everything started there,” she said.Her family live in Ivrea, a small town outside of Milan, which has no known Covid-19 cases, and she will return to Ireland in six weeks, she said.One deflated group of four young people travelling home to America missed their connecting flight by five minutes. Sitting in a corner of the airport among a pile of suitcases making frantic phone calls to rearrange their journey home, they painted a familiar scene of frustration as old as air travel itself.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293650.1593616527!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il td jim o callaghan turns down job as junior minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim O Callaghan  said he  believed his energy and abilities will be better used as a backbench Fianna Fáil TD rather than as a junior member of government. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Mr O’Callaghan told The  he was offered a junior position in the Department of Justice, with responsibility for law reform. “I was asked this afternoon by an Taoiseach, Micheál Martin TD, to accept an appointment as minister of state in the government. Having thought carefully about this offer I have decided not to accept,” he said. “The reason I am not accepting is because I believe my energy and abilities will be better used as a backbench Fianna Fáil TD rather than as a junior member of government.“At a time when many of our party’s senior members will be preoccupied with their ministerial duties, I want to devote more time to strengthening our great party by making it a more attractive option for young voters. I also believe Fianna Fáil needs strong voices outside government who can ensure that our party’s identity can be protected during the term of this coalition government.“I wish Micheál and his government every success in the years ahead.”The Government is set to appoint 17 junior ministers later on Wednesday.Many TDs are this afternoon waiting to find out if they have they made the cut.The Cabinet is due to meet later to approve the appointments. A number of front-runners for the posts in Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party say they have not yet been contacted.The party leaders did not co-ordinate their appointments for the senior ministries resulting in controversy over the absence of a minister in the West.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will have eight junior ministers each, while the Greens will have four. Each party has already announced its “super junior” – a junior minister who gets to sit at the Cabinet, though does not lead a government department and is not a full Cabinet member. They are Dara Calleary (the chief whip), the Green Party’s Pippa Hackett and Fine Gael’s Hildegarde Naughton. So seven remaining vacancies each for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and three for the Greens.There was intense speculation inside Fine Gael this afternoon that their top picks for the seven jobs include: Josepha Madigan, Martin Heydon, Damien English, Peter Burke, Brendan Griffin and Patrick O’Donovan. However, on Wednesday afternoon Mr Griffin said he wanted to wish his successor in the Department of Tourism and Sport “the very best in difficult times ahead,” suggesting he may not make the cut in this Government’s selection of junior appointments.The outgoing Minister for Education Joe McHugh is understood to have turned down a junior ministerial post.In Fianna Fáil, Meath TD Thomas Byrne is in line for Helen McEntee’s old job as junior minister for Europe, sources say. Anne Rabbitte was widely tipped for Cabinet but was left disappointed so she may expect a nod.Others include Waterford’s Mary Butler, Jack Chambers, Robert Troy and Charlie McConalogue. Michael Moynihan, Marc McSharry and James Lawless are also in the running but given the limited space some may be left disappointed.The Greens have three jobs and eight contenders. Brian Leddin, Malcolm Noonan and Marc Ó Cathasaigh are all in a strong position although questions remain over whether the party’s finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan will be offered a role."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293006.1593552694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord empty theatre eeriness as cabinet takes their seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar: Admits it is “very unusual” not to have a senior minister from the west. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIn his first Dáil appearance as Heather Humphreys’s replacement, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar confirmed what many were thinking about the botched delivery of Cabinet jobs west of the Shannon – it was a case of cock-up rather than conspiracy.With Taoiseach Micheál Martin back at base busy working himself into his new brief, his predecessor remained in the spotlight on Tuesday, opening for the Government at the start of a day-long Dáil debate on spending. It wasn’t long before Leo let the cat out of the bag about Saturday night’s Cromwellian damnation of the entire west of Ireland by their new political overlords.It seems the parties in the tripartite government simply couldn’t get their act together, which bodes well for the future.Sinn Féin’s Claire Kerrane told the freshly minted Minister for Enterprise and Trade that the non-appointment of a senior representative from the region for the first time in the history of the State was a “huge mistake” and the electorate would not forget it. The TD for Roscommon-Galway doesn’t doubt they will try to “overcompensate” by appointing a clatter of westerners as Ministers of State, but “the damage is done”.The Tánaiste tried to explain what happened, while making sure to point out that such an omission never happened when he was in charge of appointing his own cabinet. “But I think when you have three parties doing it, and perhaps not co-ordinating it, you turn up with unusual results.”Such as fury from Falcarragh to Foynes and a miffed political martyr in Mayo.If a camel is a horse designed by committee, then the cabinet Micheál, Leo and Eamon built is the Merrion Street equivalent and it’s given a lot of people the hump.But they are anxious to make amends. Varadkar admitted “it is very unusual” not to have a senior minister in Connacht and promised they would do better in the next round of appointments.Ruffled feathersIt would be interesting to know when the penny dropped and the Big Three realised they made a complete dog’s dinner of their historic cabinet, the one which officially ended Civil War politics by pitting one half of the country against the other.As part of the Government’s rearguard action to smooth ruffled feathers in the west, the Tánaiste offered comforting words. After all “We DO have Hildegarde Naughten and Dara Calleary there” he cooed, referring to the two “super junior” ministers from Galway and Mayo.Contrary to popular belief, they are full members of cabinet. Oh yes. They are full members of cabinet even if they are not members of cabinet in the constitutional sense.It doesn’t matter that they have no vote either because the Cabinet hasn’t voted on anything for the guts of 40 years.“So their weight and voice will be equal to those of any other member of the Cabinet and I want people to know that.”And in the meantime, before it’s properly decent to have a reshuffle, here’s a rake of Ministers of State to be getting on with . . .If the Dáil had been sitting in Leinster House instead of the Convention Centre in Dublin’s docklands, there might have been angry scenes and heated exchanges about the 33rd government’s inaugural clanger, but the temporary venue is a political passion killer.Even if all 160 TDs were present – most of them high-tailed it back to the cosier confines of Leinster House when not required for speaking purposes – they would have been rattling around in a 2,000-seater auditorium. There is an empty-theatre eeriness about the proceedings.The Ceann Comhairle does his best to spot speakers from behind his drab desk in the middle of the stage. He couldn’t see Leo Varadkar when it was time to begin, scanning the empty rows stretching before him.“Is the Tánaiste here?”Ushers’ torchesA door opened halfway down and Leo beetled in with his new haircut. He was escorted to his place by two ushers, one of whom held a seating map. It might be a good idea to give the ushers torches, then they could shine them on the seats to help TDs find their socially distanced designated berths, then sell them popcorn.There were a few frontbench colleagues scattered around in Leo’s general vicinity. Heather Humphreys (social protection, community and rural developments and the islands) was in the same row as Norma Foley (education), although they were well apart.When Norma arrived, Heather had to move out for her to shuffle past. All that was missing was a chorus of “sorry, sorry, sorry, beg your pardon, sorry, sorry, oops, sorry . . .” as she felt her way along the row.It’s only a matter of time before TDs start opening bags of crisps and rustling sweet wrappers during Leaders’ Questions. The pop-up seats are fancier than the ones in the Dáil. They are described frighteningly as “premium Figueras ‘eight-hour’ chairs”.There won’t be any need for that.Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins rose to speak on the revised budget questions but the Ceann Comhairle stopped him as soon as he started.“Sorry, am I sharing?” Collins asked, unaware that a party colleague was speaking in the same slot.“Deputy Troy is gesticulating furiously from the gallery” explained the chair, motioning towards the balcony where stood the TD for Longford Westmeath, like he was auditioning for Romeo and Juliet.Dress circleCollins couldn’t see him, as he was below in the stalls.“Where is he?” snapped Niall impatiently, looking around. But he couldn’t glimpse his colleague waving an order paper to gain attention and tipping dangerously towards the edge of the dress circle.“Don’t fall over there Deputy Troy. Please,” cried Seán Ó Fearghaíl with exquisite hamminess.Now Robert appeared to be trying out for Riverdance.“We spot you. Don’t worry,” boomed the Ceann Comhairle, just as we feared the deputy might plunge into the parterre with no musicians in the orchestra pit to do him justice.“So I have to share, I presume, yeah?” said Limerick County’s Collins to the vast swathe of empty seats around him while Troy, out of eyeshot, subsided into his premium Figueras, exhausted.Niall sounded disappointed, to add to his disappointment over not getting a senior job on Saturday. Probably a rap on the knuckles for his involvement in Fianna Fáil’s Votegate, War of the Buttons embarrassment. Still, at least he’s not in the Seanad, like his partner in crime, Timmy Dooley.“It’s quite hard to make yourself seen when you’re so far away” murmured Robert from the balcony when he finally got to speak. Richard Boyd Barrett, on the other hand. You can tell that the People Before Profit comes from a family of theatrical greats. He has no problem projecting in the Convention Centre auditorium.The same might have been said of Mary Lou McDonald, who is similarly vocally accomplished, but she was in Belfast at the funeral of ex-IRA chief Bobby Storey, marching along in the thick of a Covid-19 regulation-defying cortege.She’s had the virus, unlike her Sinn Féin colleagues who travelled from Dublin with her.It’s a pity they couldn’t find any masks all the same."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre.

The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second wavePolice tweet picture of man arrested for carrying a Hong Kong independence flagHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292699.1593546508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are france and germany advising against travel to ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Aer Lingus planes lined up at Dublin Airport. Photograph: Alan Betson Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark are among the European Union member states that advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.It’s rare for such countries to advise against travel to a fellow EU member state, since an agreement in Brussels that most countries in the bloc would open their borders to one another on June 15th.Why is Ireland left out? It’s due to its unusual position in the EU rather than our rate of coronavirus infections.Ireland is not in the Schengen area of free travel, unlike most EU member states. Instead, we have a Common Travel Area with Britain that is decades older.Now that the United Kingdom is no longer an EU member state and is choosing not to collaborate even on many things it is still invited to take part in, this puts Ireland in an awkward position.Because of the open border with the North, it has little choice but to follow the lead of the UK.When the Schengen states agreed to close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland and the UK went their own way. They kept their borders open, and ultimately introduced a requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine at home for two weeks after arriving.It’s this quarantine requirement that many EU states cite as the reason for advising their citizens against travel to Ireland. Nevertheless, their borders are open to travellers coming in the other direction, arriving from Ireland.“This is an advice from our side against travelling which is due to the fact that Ireland, and also Britain, have quarantine requirements that are in place for German citizens when they enter the country,” a German government spokesman said.“It doesn’t affect at all the status of Irish citizens or people travelling from Ireland.”This has led to the unusual situation that it may be easier to travel between countries like Germany and some of the non-EU states on the list – such as Rwanda, Tunisia and Uruguay – than with Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Plan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293023.1593558854!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fda issues guidance for coronavirus vaccine approval","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says a vaccine is still some time away. Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday released guidance for approving a coronavirus vaccine, saying the vaccine has to prevent or decrease disease severity in at least 50 per cent of people who are inoculated.More than 100 vaccines are being tested worldwide against the virus, which has claimed more 126,100 lives in the United States.In May, the Trump administration announced a program called “Operation Warp Speed” to speed up the development of Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines, as the country has none approved for treating the virus.Several companies such as Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are in the race to develop a vaccine.“While the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in our decisions,” the FDA said.Experts have said it could take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to be developed.Vaccine developers have also been asked for data to support use during pregnancy and to show safety and effectiveness in children, the health regulator said.“The guidelines are pretty standard, they look pretty much like influenza vaccine guidelines,” said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo vaccine research group. “I don’t think that’s a high bar. I think that’s a low to maybe an appropriate bar for a first-generation Covid-19 vaccine.”Flu vaccines are 30 -70 per cent effective in any given year, according to Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. The guidelines could be seen as a relatively high bar given the urgency to accelerate availability of a vaccine, Yee added.Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States government’s top infectious diseases expert, cautioned that there is no guarantee of a safe and effective vaccine. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"around third no coronavirus symptoms may have developed immunity","story":"Until now, efforts to measure levels of protection against coronavirus have focused on antibodies, which have proved an unreliable measure. Sampling in the UK suggests that around seven per cent of people in England have developed antibodies, rising to 17 per cent in London. The new research suggests that levels of T-cell immunity may be significantly higher.Antibody testing has been dogged by problems, as tests have proved unreliable and it is not clear how much immunity antibodies confer. The results have yet to be peer-reviewed. At the end of May, tests found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholm\u0027s inhabitants had developed Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April. This was far short of the 25 percent Sweden\u0027s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, had estimated, but Prof Ljunggren said that, with more recent Stockholm studies showing that about 17 percent of people had tested positive for antibodies, the predictions did not look so far out. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed areas could face local coronavirus lockdowns within","story":"The new PHE figures show Barnsley has the third highest rate per 100,000 population with 54.7 cases, followed by Rochdale (53.6) and Bedford (42). Former Government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said these places were clearly of concern.  Search for your area in the table below to see the difference between previously published case counts and revisions including Pillar 2 dataAs it is, we\u0027re having to spread our resources over a wide area rather than targeting them effectively.

This has prevented local authorities from developing, in real time, a picture of what is happening in their communities.According to data available to Leicester officials, the city recorded 80 new positive tests between 13 and 26 June. However, separate government-held data showed that there were 944 infections over the same period.He added he has been trying “for weeks” to access data on the level of testing in the city and was only provided with this last Thursday.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It should have been with us from early on. I think once this is all over there’ll be serious questions to ask.”Dr Susan Barton, the councillor for Braunstone Park and Rowley Fields, said it had “taken quite a while to get to where we are”.“We have been kept in the dark as I can’t really tell you anything as I haven’t seen any data myself at the moment,” she told The Independent, adding that “our priority is making sure the city is kept safe and any infection is kept under control”.The British Medical Association (BMA) has since urged the government to share “timely, comprehensive and reliable” information to all those involved in the management of new cases at a local level.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.(left to right) Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u0027Neill attending the funeral of senior Irish Republican and former leading IRA figure Bobby Storey in west BelfastFormer Team GB Rhythmic Gymnastic dancer Hannah Martin during a training session at Ouse Valley Viaduct in SussexPeople visit Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, that recently reopened following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictionA protest for Justice for Shukri Abdi on Trafalgar Square in London, following a raft of Black Lives Matter protests  across the UKPolice at the scene of an incident at the Park Inn Hotel in central Glasgow.

They needed clarity from the start, and I am astonished that it is being drip-fed as the day progresses.”Speculation has also arisen over how Leicester came to be one of England’s worst-affected cities. The Independent understands that, in the government briefings with local officials and public health figures that preceded Monday’s announcement, there was a recognition that cases in Leicester were spiking but those present struggled to clearly explain why.It was suggested that the city’s food processing plants, which are being allowed to stay open under the current restrictions, were responsible for an initial resurgence that spread throughout the wider population. The end of Ramadan, and an apparent coming together of Leicester’s Muslim communities, was also raised as a possible explanation.Top public health officials additionally theorised that the R rate in Leicester never really fell after the UK-wide lockdown was first implemented on 23 March, meaning it continued to “bubble” away until the more recent spike.Amid ongoing investigations and analysis into the city’s outbreak, focus has turned to how Leicester’s restrictions will be implemented and what support will be provided.How villages in Leicester’s shadow have been left in ‘confusion’Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the local population was “crying out” for answers while health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, said people and local businesses were “really worried” and “anxious” over what is to come.On Tuesday, the Leicestershire Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said it was “essential we get clarity from the government as soon as possible on what the public can and can’t do”. Claudia Webb, MP for Leicester East, meanwhile called for “unity” among the city’s communities and warned against playing the “blame game”.“Because of the way this whole communication has been managed, we’re now going into blame and people have already started that,” she said. “This is going to cause isions and not unity. I wholeheartedly reject those seeing to blame Leicester residents for this outbreak. It’s unacceptable.“What I’m concerned about is how you keep communities united. That is one of my key missions as a member of parliament, is keeping the unity among extremely erse communities so that we haven’t got Hindus blaming Muslims, Sikhs blaming Hindus and then there’s the white working class. All of these groups need to stay united as a city. Unity is what is needed now. We must come together.”Boris Johnson, facing criticism from Mr Starmer that the government had been “slow to act”, said in the House of Commons that the “government first took notice and acted” on the spike in infections in Leicester on 8 June.“We sent mobile testing units shortly thereafter,” he said. ”For reasons that I think the house will probably understand, there were particular problems in Leicester in implementing the advice and in getting people to understand what was necessary to do.”department for health and social care\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

Ministers have faced criticism for the handling of the surge in cases in Leicester, which was put into the UK’s first local lockdown on Tuesday. Australian authorities, meanwhile, will lock down about 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for one month from today after two weeks of double-digit rises in new Covid-19 cases.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUK coronavirus death toll rises by 176 to 43,906More UK cities and towns being monitored for fresh virus spikesPM \u0027blind to risks\u0027 of lifting lockdown, says StarmerGovernment urged to extend furlough scheme \u0027to save millions of jobs\u0027Leading doctors say local authorities must be given better Covid-19 dataAustralia locks down 300,000 in Melbourne to contain outbreakUK \u0027has adequate stocks\u0027 of Covid-19 drugProfessor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, told the Science and Technology Committee there are enough doses of remdesivir for use in the UK.He said: Right now, there are stocks in the UK - and I judge us to have adequate stocks - of pre-licenced, as in unlicensed, clinical trial stocks of remdesivir which are available to be used through the emergency access protocol.Bradford says it is not following Leicester, despite coronavirus case numbersBradford has said it is working hard to prevent another lockdown and Barnsley has stressed new restrictions are not needed, as figures revealed they have the highest Covid-19 rates in England after Leicester.The latest data shows Bradford has 69.4 cases per 100,000 population, the second highest in England behind Leicester with 140.2.Bradford council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said: We know that figures from Public Health England show Bradford with a high number of infections along with a number of other northern authorities, although we are some way behind Leicester.The number of people testing positive for the virus is still too high and we continue to work hard with all our partners to prevent infection spreading as no one wants a second lockdown.As we take more and more steps towards returning to a more normal life, it\u0027s easy to believe that Covid-19 is less of a threat to our health and the health of our family and friends.This is simply not the case.We urge all residents to continue to follow the guidelines around staying at home as much as possible, social distancing, washing hands frequently and ensuring that they self-isolate and get tested if they, or anyone in their household, develop any symptoms.Oxford University has seen \u0027right sort of immune response\u0027 in potential\u0026nbspvaccine trialA leading scientist behind the University of Oxford\u0027s potential Covid-19 vaccine said\u0026nbspthe team has seen the right sort of immune response in trials, which have entered the Phase III clinical stage.Speaking at a parliamentary hearing, Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the university, said the trial has enrolled 8,000 volunteers for Phase III of its trial into the vaccine, AZD1222, which was licensed to AstraZeneca.She said she couldn\u0027t give a timeline for when the vaccine might be ready as it depends on the results of the trial.\u0026nbspGreater Manchester councils publish figures showing rate of infectionCouncils in Greater Manchester have published new figures about the rate of Covid-19.They said the rate of infection for Greater Manchester as a whole - which includes 10 councils - was 13.3 per 100,000 people as of June 30, compared to locked-down Leicester, which they said was 135.\u0026nbspIn a statement, they said: Some of our ten districts have higher infection numbers and rates than others, and compared to the North West and national they are still higher than they should be.\u0026nbspSir Richard Leese, chair of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, said: The figures published today show the situation in each of our districts and while the number of positive cases of Covid-19 is slightly higher in some councils compared to others, we are closely monitoring and managing the situation. We don\u0027t want anyone to be alarmed.\u0026nbspRather, the purpose of making this information public is to be open, honest and transparent with the public about what\u0027s happening in their area so they can make an informed choice in their day-to-day lives.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve also been doing more testing compared to other parts of England and this will be reflected in our figures.Barnsley Council reassures residents town \u0027not at risk of going into further lockdown\u0027Barnsley Council has sought to reassure residents the town is not at risk of going into a further lockdown like Leicester has.The local authority acknowledged the town has seen higher rates of coronavirus than the national average, but put this down to\u0026nbspsome natural variation in the disease our proactive and targeted testing our higher density of care homes and our local population which is older than the national average and has higher rates of underlying diseases and other Covid-19 risk factors such as smoking.It added in a statement: According to our most up-to-date data, we have seen a reduction in the number of daily new cases and in the average number of new cases for four consecutive days.We are continuing to monitor this and other data very closely, and to proactively manage the disease locally and in line with national guidance.This is why we do not believe at this stage any further measures will need to be implemented such as the ones seen in Leicester.Read the statement in full:\u0026nbsphttps:www.barnsley.gov.ukstatements01072020-numbers-of-coronavirus-covid-19-cases-in-barnsleyNo new laws planned to stop people entering and leaving LeicesterNew laws are not planned at this stage to stop people entering or leaving Leicester, Downing Street has said.Asked about the police\u0027s powers in the city, the prime minister\u0027s official spokesman said: We are recommending against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester, and we expect the vast majority of people to abide by the rules, but we are not putting that into law at this stage.Kazakhstan plans two-week lockdown from 5 July after spike in casesThe Kazakh government has proposed imposing\u0026nbspthe Central Asian nation\u0027s second lockdown from July 5 for at least two weeks\u0026nbspafter a sharp rise in new cases.President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said\u0026nbspon Twitter a special commission would review the plan on July 2 and then lay out its details.Mr Tokayev ordered his cabinet this week to urgently tighten the restrictions after the number of Covid-19 cases surged more than sevenfold following the lifting of the first lockdown in mid-May.PM \u0027blind to the risks\u0027 of easing lockdown, says StarmerKeir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of being blind to the risks of easing the coronavirus lockdown this weekend.Speaking during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, he noted the latest round of restrictions were being lifted without an app, without clear data for local authorities or the world-beating system we were promised.He added: I support the easing of restrictions but unlike the prime minister, I\u0027m not blind to the risks and I don\u0027t think anybody else should be.Starmer said: Of the 22,000 new cases of Covid infections per week in mid June, just 5,000 were reached and asked to provide details. So now three quarters of people with Covid-19 are not being reached. How does the prime minister explain that?Johnson replied: As he knows very well the test, track and trace operation is actually reaching huge numbers of people and causing them to self-isolate in ways I don\u0027t think he conceivably could have expected a month ago when this system was set up.The PM\u0026nbspadded that the test and trace system has now reached 113,000 contacts, 113,000 contacts who have undertaken to self-isolate to stop the disease spreading.Starmer says government must extend furlough scheme for workers at risk of losing jobsKeir Starmer\u0026nbsphas urged the government to extend the coronavirus\u0026nbspfurlough scheme\u0026nbspfor workers most at risk of redundancy.The Labour leader warned next week\u0027s financial statement\u0026nbspcould be the last chance to save millions of jobs.Rob Merrick has the story:No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it appears to have either been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere, or never failed to form one.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, researchers can see the core that would normally be found inside such an exoplanet. That allows them to look inside the interior of the world and learn about its composition.The newly discovered planet orbits a star similar to our Sun, and is found about 730 light years away. It is known as TOI 849 b, and conditions there are intense: it is so close to its star that a year takes 18 hours, and the surface temperature is around 1,500 degrees Celsius.That places the planet right in the Neptunian Desert, the region near stars where planets the size of Neptune are rarely found.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeThe planet is strangely close to its star, considering its mass, said David Armstrong from the University of Warwick, the lead author of the study, in a statement. In other words, we don\u0027t see planets with this mass at these short orbital periods.Researchers were able to conclude that it was just a planetary core by conducting detailed measurements, which found that the planet is about 40 times heavier than the Earth, but only 3.4 times as large. That density must mean that it is made up mostly of iron, rock and water, with only small amounts of hydrogen and helium.The fact that we don\u0027t see those gases lets us know TOI 849 b is an exposed planetary core, said Dr Armstrong.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It was then further analysed by the HARPS instrument run by the European Southern Observatory, which uses the Doppler effect to measure exoplanets by looking for the wobble in their light that happens as they move nearer and further from us.One way or another, TOI 849 b either used to be a gas giant or is a \u0027failed\u0027 gas giant, said Dr Armstrong.It\u0027s a first, telling us that planets like this exist and can be found.We have the opportunity to look at the core of a planet in a way that we can\u0027t do in our own solar system.There are still big open questions about the nature of Jupiter\u0027s core, for example, so strange and unusual exoplanets like this give us a window into planet formation that we have no other way to explore.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry. I can’t be more honoured.”The piece was originally commissioned by London Advertising, whose founder Michael Moszynski said: “We’re looking forward to seeing the final figures raised.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We have been on it.”The emergency crackdown in Leicester follows the revelation that one in 10 new infections nationwide are happening in the cityNon-essential shops will shut and remain closed for the foreseeable future, most schools will be closed from Thursday and plans to relax shielding measures for the most vulnerable have been shelved.With the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants no longer permitted to reopen this weekend, there are fears of people flocking to nearby Derby and Nottingham, for example.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut EU employers are anticipating the end of those right, which will make it harder for Britons to do some jobs that involve cross-border travel.“We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU,” Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee.UK policies risk ‘retaliatory deportations’ for Brits living in EUWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We’re not even at the end of transition yet and there are already real live instances of people’s lives and livelihoods being affected – and that will only increase. So many jobs rely on free movement because of the single market.”Ms Meadows added: “We have a very large number of people whose livelihood is based on working in different countries – people with small businesses, people who are employed, and an awful lot of them face losing our livelihoods. It’s not just about losing your rights on paper, it’s something that affects real lives.”While the Brexit withdrawal agreement protects some of the rights of British citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK, there are holes in it, notably with regard to jobs not based in a single member state. The integrated nature of EU economies means that occasional travel to other countries is common, particularly in professional-level occupations.There are also gaps in the extent to which Britons’ qualifications will be mutually recognised in the EU after Brexit.Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: “There’s a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain – there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won’t be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this – to go and study and work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no rights in the withdrawal agreement on cross-border working,” she said.Britain and the EU are currently negotiating a future relationship, which both sides have always said will cover immigration issues.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Oiled by the Kremlin’s election machine, the result of Vladimir Putin’s vote on constitutional reform — one that would allow him to rule until 2036 — was never in doubt.But the decision by Russia\u0027s election commission to publish ‘preliminary’ live results five hours before polling closed was a novelty that shocked the most cynical of observers.The projection of 73 per cent in favour of amendments was broadly in line with exit polls published by state pollsters FOM and VTsIOM. They projected 70 per cent and 76 per cent respectively, also before the end of polling.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpposition opposition groups painted an altogether different picture. Their own exit polls projected a tie in Moscow (49.91 per cent for, 49.87 against) and a defeat for the president in his home city of St Petersburg (42,02 percent for, 57.7 per cent against).The constitutional plebiscite was an unusual electoral exercise for Russia, with polling stretched over seven days and in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said the unprecedented measure was necessary to ensure safe voting.Why is Putin changing the constitution?For critics, it was a trick to boost turnout from a population tired of their longtime leader.The vote is taking place in a tricky period for Mr Putin, who has lost much of his glow after a torrid few months of uninspired Covid-19 crisis management. According to Levada Centre, Russia’s most independent pollster, Mr Putin is still trusted by 59 per cent of Russians, but that figure is down 30 per cent from a post-Crimea high of three years ago.In open polling, i.e. when Russians are asked to name the politicians they most trust themselves, support drops to 29 per cent. The figure is lowest among young voters, with less than one in ten expressing affiliation.This week’s ballot asked for a “yes” or “no” answer to 206 amendments in entirety, with the proposal to reset term limits buried deep amongst them. It was “technically impossible” to ask voters to go through the changes one by one, authorities claimed.Invariably, official campaign literature focused on the other 205 amendments, targeting populist pressure points from marriage as a heterosexual union to indexation guarantees for pensions and other social benefits. In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Putin made no mention of the all-important clause.The vote has been marred with allegations of vote rigging, though given the prevalence of home and electronic voting, this is difficult to verify.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Deputy elections chief Nikolai Bulayev talking about a “breakthrough” in the low number of complaints received.Opposition groups begged to differ, with election monitors Golos reporting on over 1500 separate infringements during the seven day vote. Ella Pamfilova, Mr Bulyaev’s boss, dismissed the claims, and Golos as a “toxic and degraded” organisation. Earlier this week, Mr Putin said that election manipulation methods such as forced voting, “rounding errors” in counting and inflating turnout were “inadmissible.” But there was evidence of all methods being rolled out — and more.On Thursday, the first day of voting, Pavel Lobkov, a journalist for the independent Dozhd television channel, reported he had managed to vote twice. He was later questioned by police for his efforts, with prosecutors now threatening criminal charges for “election fraud.”‘Like two guys in a steam bath’: Source describes Trump-Putin callsSupport for Putin wanes in his former Russian strongholdPutin says coronavirus is retreating and condemns anyone who disagreesPutin looms over Russia’s latest vote – but it’s not all about himA week earlier, a colleague from the same channel was taken in for questioning after he uncovered a corrupt scheme to register elderly voters for electronic voting. Some of the most egregious manipulations during the week were recorded in the northern capital of St Petersburg.There, election officials were recorded by local journalists stuffing papers into the ballot box. At another polling station, an election observer claimed officials refused to give him access to voting numbers.When journalist David Frenkel followed up on these claims a day later, he was seriously assaulted by a police officer and another unidentified man. He ended up in hospital with a broken shoulder bone. Ilya Azar, the journalist who has become an unexpected alternative protest figurehead, announced a protest for 6pm local time (4pm BST) in Pushkin square.He was responding to a “coup d’etat,” he said in a Facebook post. But in an admission of the complexities of protesting in Russia, he said he would not be openly encouraging others to join him.“Let every man decide for himself,” he said. “20,000 rouble (£130) fines and 30 day jail terms are very likely.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”“We know what happened next,# he says.“Thats why there needs to be a laser-like focus on protecting jobs.”Mr Johnson says Sir Keir should pay tribute to the Government for protecting million jobs with the furlough scheme and says he wont put a figure on the jobs that could be lost.“Thats why were proceeding with the New Deal, the fair deal for British people,” he argues.“We are going to build, build, build and provide jobs, jobs, jobs.”Boris Johnson is facing off against Sir Keir Starmer for PMQs this afternoon.Sir Keir says the local authorities in Leicester, where the lockdown has been extended, had just half of the information they needed – and didnt even know the real figure of people affected until last week.“The local authority thought there were  positive tests in the last fortnight, when the real figure was ,” he says, adding that theres been a “lost week when the virus was spreading”.Mr Johnson hits back – he says the Government shares its data with all local authorities across the country.However, in defending the whack-a-mole strategy, he does acknowledge there were issues in Leicester.“There were particular problems in implementing the advice and getting people to understand what was necessary to do,” Mr Johnson says.Following on from that last blog post, we thought wed revisit a story from April about the UKs drive to get enough PPE.At that time, Brussels insisted the British Government was given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme to bulk buy medical equipment.Officials said officials from the UK apparently missed a series of key meetings on it.And they said the plan to pool procurement of key kit including ventilators and PPE had been a “recurring topic” at virtual meetings British officials attended.Heres that story.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK missed out on the chance to take part in European Union procurement schemes for PPE because the information was sent to an outdated email address.He suggested Brussels officials were to blame for not updating their contact details.In a letter to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, he said: “The relevant EU committee, the Joint Procurement Agreement Steering Committee , was relaunched by the European Commission in September , after three years of not meeting.“The UK provided up-to-date contact details for the UK representatives to the JPASC in September .“Despite this, however, we understand from the commission that the UK contact details on their circulation list… were still those of the previous UK representatives – ie those who had last attended JPSAC in .”Image: GettyBrexit talks resumed this week # and the German chancellor is hopeful for a dealthe UK takes a more realistic approach.Angela Merkel said she believes she can #moderate# between the two sides to get a deal # but only#the UK needs to take a more realistic approach#. A source close to the Chancellor said: #It takes two to tango. #Its not just our willingness.#Brexit talks resumed this week against a backdrop of huge economic uncertainty. And now a union leader says he fears the pandemic will turn railway stations into “ghost towns” after sandwich chain Upper Crust announced huge redundancies.Mick Lynch, assistant general secretary at rail union RMT, said: “Support services across the rail industry are facing a real crisis in the months ahead, which will hammer both the workforce and those who rely on their facilitiesthe Government doesnt intervene as the lockdown eases.“Our railway stations are in danger of ending up as ghost towns as we emerge from the pandemic.“Every member of the rail workforce from caterers to cleaners and those who operate trains and track is important to our future success.”Its understood Germany believes Brexit talks could go on beyond the summer # despite Boris Johnsons deadline.The PM has given Brussels three months to seal the deal when it comes to the UKs exit.But its been reported that officials in Berlin are preparing for a deal to be wrapped by as late as November.This week, Mr Johnsons official spokesman said: #Talks can’t go on into the autumn.#Asked how long negotiations could continue, the spokesman said the PM was clear about #not wanting to be continuing having talks in October#. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she wants Boris Johnson to be more flexible when it comes to Brexit.Merkel will play an influential role in the remaining talks after she today assumed the role as head of the EU’s rotating presidency. And her ambassador in Brussels says trade talks are one of her top priorities for the next six months.The Express reports that Michael Cluass said: “Either the EU will succeed in negotiating a treaty that will shape relations with the UK in a good way, or we will have a rough landing on January , , which would be very similar to hard Brexit.#Home Secretary Priti Patel spoke out after MPs backed immigration legislation which seeks to end EU freedom of movement rules in the UK.She said: “Last year the British people sent a clear message that they wanted to end free movement and our landmark Bill delivers exactly that.”Image: AFPMPs have backed flagship immigration legislation which seeks to end EU freedom of movement rules in the UK.The Bill is part of the move towards the Government’s points-based immigration system, to be introduced from .It was passed at the third reading by  votes to , majority .The Bill will now be considered by peers in the House of Lords.Image: PAFrom this morning, businesses are able to start bringing staff back part-time.Firms will be able to decide which employees they bring back and what hours they do, while paying the wages for the time they work.From August, employers will have to start contributing to their staff wages again.According to the latest figures from the Treasury, more than . million jobs have been protected under the scheme at a cost of £. billion to the taxpayer.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “The furlough scheme, which will have been open for eight months by October, has been a leline for millions of people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the hardest job Ive ever had to do, says the NHS hero.Dad was taking the mickey out of me as normal during the journey.I said to him, Oh Dad, I could drive you, and he went, No best you don’t! You stay in the back with me.Sadly, I had to take him straight into the Covid bay. I was all professional but when I handed him over, thats when I lost it.I had to leave him and he died on his own. A -year-old war hero shouldn’t have died alone.She adds: All these people acting like nothing’s happening makes me so angry. They just don’t think it’s real, and that’s so upsetting.Everything has been taken away from us.Stanley, who lived in the upmarket East Sussex town of Crowborough with we Pamela, , is among more than , Covid deaths in Britain.Only five months before he died, hed been awarded France’s highest order of merit - the Légion d’honneur - for his achievements during the war. After joining the British Navy aged , Stanley had served on the frontline of World War Two, even taking part in the D-Day landings in June .The award was such a lovely thing for him to get, says mum-of-three Sara.He wasn’t one of these men who talked about the war. He always said, I don’t want to talk about the sad times - he lost a lot of friends. But he did say on VE Day, he travelled up to Scotland to pick up a boat that had been surrendered by the Germans. He said it was very weird walking on to the boat, while all the Germans were walking off it.He was so proud to serve.In recent years, Stanley hadnt let his age hold him back - regularly visiting his local golf club, where he was known as Stan the man.He was a real character - very well-liked, very jolly, says Sara, who also lives in Crowborough with her husband Chris, .He was driving up until last year - which did scare me a little bit!She adds that, though her dad suffered from Parkinsons disease, he lived independently with Pamela, his beloved partner of  years.They were very self-sufficient, she says.However, carers had recently started visiting her parents home after Stanley had a short spell in hospital with high potassium levels. They helped him with everyday tasks, like getting dressed - though the strong-willed veteran would often insist on doing them himself.Because of her frontline role with the ambulance service, Sara says she ensured she kept away from her parents during the Covid lockdown.She only visited their home to leave food shopping on their doorstep, after they struggled to get slots with online supermarkets.Her brother - who works for the police - was careful, too. And its for this reason Sara believes her dads carers - who allegedly wore no PPE- transmitted Covid to him.Id been sheltering him and nobody had gone to see him, she says.The carers are the only ones who could have brought it in to him. That was even more heartbreaking because I’d done all my bits to protect him.She adds: I later said to my mum, They were all wearing PPE, weren’t they  She went, ‘No, only one girl wore it, the other ones didn’t.  Sara, who spoke to her dad via phone every day, was half-way through a quiet ambulance sht when she got the job to take him to hospital.Though she was aware that she was picking up her own father - because his GP made the call-out - it was still a heartbreaking moment for her.During the journey, proud dad Stanley watched his daughter hard at work as he battled what doctors initially thought was just a chest infection.Despite his temperature and rattly chest, he managed to joke around with Sara in the back of the ambulance - though their interaction was hindered by her sweltering PPE.We’re very thorough in the ambulance, we sterilise everything, Sara says.Were hot on this whole situation. Every job we do, we have to put PPE on, no matter what - evenit’s a stubbed toe or tummy ache.“Dad was a bit hard of hearing so I was having to shout at him because he couldnt hear. He couldnt lip-read because of my mask.Arriving at hospital, Sara felt a lump form in her throat as her dad was taken away to be examined and tested for coronavirus.Yet she didnt think for a moment he would have the deadly virus. We said, No Covid concerns, because we’d sheltered him, she says.Then when we got the phone call the next day to say he’d tested positive, it was just like a bolt. It was horrible because I knew then that he wouldn’t survive it. And he didn’t - three days later he was dead.”Stanley - who was close to Saras kids Georgia, Samuel and Charlie - died on April , the same date as his daughters wedding anniversary. “We managed to get in to see him on the Saturday [April ] and by then he knew we were there but he sort of didn’t, Sara adds.We had an hour and a half with him and that was it.He squeezed my hand but he wasn’t the dad we all knew.The heartbroken family then faced another blow with Stanleys funeral - as Covid restrictions meant only a handful of them could attend.“At the crematorium, all the seats are two metres apart so you can’t even sit next to your family, or hold your mum’s hand, says Sara.I was crying and my husband said, All I wanted to do was give you a cuddle but I couldn’t. It was just horrendous.She adds: I knew Dad was going to pass away - he was  - but he shouldn’t have died from Covid.Due to her dads Covid-positive test, Sara had to self-isolate for two weeks, meaning she couldnt stay with her elderly, grieving mum.She has since ed to work, which she says has helped her through her grief and allowed her to care for other sick pensioners.Ive had a couple of wobbles, admits Sara, who used to volunteer as a Community First Responderbefore starting her dream job last June. There have been gents where I’ve sort of thought, you look like my dad, you act like my dad. But I love my job so much.Yet while the ambulance hero is risking her own le to save others during the pandemic, thousands of Brits have flouted social distancing guidelines for a bit of sun.A major incident was declared in Bournemouth, Dorset, last week after defiant sunseekers crowded on to the beach, leaving emergency crews completely overstretched.And Sara now warns a second wave of coronavirus is a ticking time bomb waiting to happen - as she condemns the nightmare beach scenes.Dad would call them selfish idiots, she says.When I said to him, Dad, I can’t come and see you, he said, No, I understand, you’re trying to keep me safe.He gave up a lot in his le, so why can’t people give up going to the beach  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed.

We’ve been hearing more parties recently in gardens.”In contrast to the city centre, local supermarkets were busy yesterday as hundreds of people rushed to load up with essentials.As staff struggled to keep shelves stocked, shopper Jaqruei Laiseta, , said: “Last time, I couldn’t get anything — no pasta, no milk, no flour.

It wasn’t that long ago we were heading to Costa clutching our reusable coffee cups with pride and packing our groceries into our “bags for le”.We were horried when David Attenborough showed us footage of a turtle tangled up in plastic that had found its way into the ocean.We dutully sorted our trash into recycling bins and shunned plastic straws.Now it is like a boil has burst. People have been repressed for so long during lockdown that, now they are free to go out again, they have forgotten how to behave.They see others leave their rubbish and think it is OK to do it too. It is classic copycat behaviour. If a place looks like a dump, people start treating it like that.When daytrippers are drinking or getting high on “laughing gas”, they are likely to lose their inhibitions. They become irresponsible and unashamed of urinating in the street.If you can’t find a bin or they are all overflowing, take your rubbish home with you. It’s not dficult.In fact, take two carrier bags out with you — one for your litter and oneyou really can’t find a toilet.Butit comes to that, please hide yourself away. It is so undignied to think of people defecating in public places such as the grounds of the Queen’s Balmoral estate, as The Sun reported on Monday. For goodness’ sake! A lot of public loos aren’t open — and that is something councils need to really look at. No one wants to see our countryside turned into a toilet.It is great we can now meet up with others for a few drinks in the outdoors and take the family to the beach. But we really must look at ourselves.The police have better things to do than tell grown men and women to bin their McDonald’s boxes. Now is the time to take some personal responsibility.It is interesting that people in Wales and Scotland are still restricted to travelling just five miles from their homes. If people in England can’t respect our outdoors, perhaps we should apply that across the whole UK.Then the only people allowed on our glorious beaches would be locals who care for the area. Another idea might be to place refuse trucks nearby, with bins for general waste and recycling containers. That way there would be no excuse not to dispose of your rubbish properly.In Spain’s Benidorm, sun worshippers have to use an online booking system to secure their spot on the sand. That keeps the numbers at an acceptable level.We have the Keep It, Bin It campaign — a joint message from the Government and Keep Britain Tidy. But at the moment it seems to be falling on deaf ears. We need to be tough.Clearly, putting up signs saying “Beauty dies where litter lies” is not doing the job. We need bigger fines to act as a real deterrent.Alternatively, we could follow the example of Calornia, in the US, where they impose community service on louts who leave their rubbish behind.When I was in Los Angeles I saw people in unorm cleaning the beaches.In that city, a third littering offence results in  hours of collecting rubbish.Such community service could be a humbling experience that would help people realise how unpleasant it is to tidy up someone ’s mess.Sadly, it seems we need to be reminded about wildle and seale getting choked by plastic.Perhaps we need to see some stark images on Instagram, TikTok and all the other social media young people use. Not that young people are solely at fault. Unfortunately, many of those to blame are old enough to know better.It seems our morals have gone out of the window along with social distancing. The messaging from the Government has been all over the place.Better enforcement of social distancing — as we saw in the early days of lockdown — would mean fewer people congregating in public areas and less litter.People in England have been told it is OK to go to the beach, meet other people and enjoy themselves . . . and they have gone mad. In Wales and Scotland, the messaging has been very clear.One piece of good news is that the weather is going to be rubbish this weekend, when the pubs and restaurants reopen.Perhaps that will limit the numbers heading to our beaches and parks, giving us all some extra time to think about how we behave.We have come through lockdown but we need to emerge in positive fashion, thinking about each other — and our country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants from looking for possible successors instead of doing their jobs.Among those turning out to the polls was a bear cub in Siberia who decided against backing Putin’s plan to become leader for le.Three month old Glasha looked unimpressed at an outdoor polling station set up for Russia’s constitutional plebiscite.The cub almost tipped over some anti-coronavirus sanitiser before  grabbing a pile of voting papers and chucking them on the ground.The handler admitted the bear had been invited to  the polling station, at a secondary school, in a stunt to encourage voters to come to the poll. We received a call last night and were asked to come, said zoo keeper Alexander Chenotaryev.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If I was to be more blunt, I would say that we’ll all be six foot under before it’s even half built at this glacial rate of progress. Boris was at pains to tell us he’s no communist. I think we knew that. What we discovered is that he’s no Franklin D Roosevelt either. President Roosevelt is famous for unlocking mega-bucks to lt America out of the Great Depression in the s. Our Prime Minister’s wallet, by contrast, is a bit thinner. While Roosevelt built the Hoover Dam, Johnson promised some bridge repairs in Sandwell. To be fair, there was some good news for Greater Manchester in the speech. We were give £m to clean up brownfield sites and build more homes on them. This will allow us to make some further inroads into tackling the housing crisis, although much more is needed. I was also pleased to hear the £ billion commitment to upgrade school buildings - though it didn’t escape my notice that it came almost  years to the day since Michael Gove scrapped Labour’s £ billion Building Schools for the Future programme. What the North of England needs more than anything is investment in our Victorian rail infrastructure which is responsible for the timetable chaos of recent years.  So we welcome the Prime Minister’s recognition of the “rail bottleneck” in Manchester City centre in his speech. But we’re not sure about his solution. We already have a plan in place to build two new s at Manchester Piccadilly to solve it. Instead of giving that the green light, the PM chose to allocate £m to develop an alternative plan. How does that fit with his much-vaunted Project Speed  Overall, and not for the first time with this Government, the hype before the speech overshadowed the real thing. There are only a certain number of times that you can promise to dual the A before people begin to switch off. As I said on Monday, “levelling up” needs to be about skin and bone as well as concrete and steel. People are crying out for help now and it would helpthe PM acknowledged this before promising any more shiny projects in the dim and distant future. One of the statistics which haunts me from this crisis was the Unison survey of care workers in the North West. It found % said they feared they wouldn’t be paidthey needed to self-isolate. Just think about that. We have a care service in England which has such poor employment conditions that it forces people to stay in work evenare ill. If the PM had started his speech by promising that, from now on, the heroes who work in our care homes looking after our relatives will get paid at least the same as a nurse, then I think the whole country would have risen to applaud him.

Working from home became the norm, socialising was forced online and missing loved ones became an everyday occurance. As the virusapos hold begins to ease, some places are beginning to see the strict restrictions lted, but weaposre still a long way from le as we knew it. Non-essential businesses - including pubs - will reopen their doors in England this weekend, and people will finally be able to reunite with family for longer periods of time. But whataposs next  Back in May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed his -page road map plan for getting the UK out of lockdown, both socially and economically. The next big change is due to happen this weekend, with a large number of restrictions being relaxed in England. Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can reopen their doors on Saturday  July and two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closer - but only  they sit side-by-side or wear a mask. However aposlocal lockdownsapos will be introduced for areas experiencing a surge in cases. Leicester was the first city to be forced back indoors in a bid to control the virus, going back to step one of lockdown. There are another  other cities or towns which are deemed at risk and could follow in Leicesteraposs footsteps. And then what  While many things are starting to get back to normal, many businesses and industries are still waiting for the green light to reopen. Nightclubs, bowling alleys, indoor playareas, swimming pools, tattoo studios, water parks and conference centres are just some of the places weaposre still waiting for an update for.  The beauty industry is still at a standstill, with everything except hairdressers - including beauty salons and nail bars - remaining closed. However there may be a light at the end of the tunnel for the fitness industry, including gyms. Despite Government sources says gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces, they could be open in a fortnight. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. The government wants all children to go back to school in September, and parents will face finesthey donapost sent their kids in. A plan is due to be outlined this week on how exactly that will happen. Unions have warned it is impossible to reopen schools while maintaining social distancing - there simply isnapost enough space. Currently, children have to be kept in separate bubbles of  pupils or fewer. So ministers are considering massively expanding these bubbles to cover  pupils - which is basically the whole class - or even an entire year group.

Downing Street refused to guarantee Public Health England would continue in its current form after Tory MPs called for it to be scrapped.It comes after Boris Johnson yesterday said some parts of the state had been sluggish in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. He did not say which bits he meant.Public Health England has been responsible for much of the controversial testing programme in England, which saw widespread community testing axed in March. It was then slowly brought back as capacity increased. Briefing against PHE intensied overnight as a former minister told the Dailyit appeared destined for the chop. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, added to the newspaper: I would abolish PHE tomorrow. What this has shown is thatministers are to take responsibility for things they must also have control, and they donapost have control over PHE. The newspaper reported that the Treasury was reviewing whether plans to establish a new PHE headquarters in Harlow, Essex, should go ahead. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman today insisted PHE was playing a key role but did not rule out whether it could undergo major reforms or be scrapped. He said: “PHE are playing a key role in our response working on important issues such as detection, surveillance, contact-tracing and testing. “They have been working hard to help protect the country and to provide insight in our efforts to beat the virus. “Separately, you’re aware that the roadmap we published in May says we must learn the right lessons from this crisis and act to ensure the government’s structures are fit to cope.

Mark Sheldon, , found pal Gareth Oldroyd, , dead on the sofa at his house after the pair had spent the evening together taking drugs, a court heard this week Sheldon and his housemate, Martin Webley, refused to contact emergency services about the tragedy for fear of getting into trouble with the police, it was heard. They covered Mr Oldroydaposs body with a blanket and continued to live in a bedroom at the house in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after moving the TV out of the living room. The court heard Sheldon failed to raise the alarm despite the dead manaposs panicked loved ones filing a missing person report to the police. Authorities were eventually contacted by one of Sheldonaposs other friends, who became suspicious and challenged the defendant over his behaviour. Sheldon confessed to the man that Mr Oldroyd was dead in the living room and his body was eventually recovered more than a week after he stopped breathing. Appearing in the dock at Leeds Crown Court this week, the defendant was jailed for nine months after pleading guilty to an offence of preventing a lawful and decent burial. Prosecutor James Lake said officers went to the house on December , , where they noticed a strong smell and found Mr Oldroydaposs body in an advanced state of decomposition. Mr Lake said it appeared as though Sheldon and Mr Webley had continued to live at the property as there were left over meals and drinks in the kitchen. Mr Webley would have been facing the same charge but has since died from a drug overdose, the court heard.

He and his family were unable to see Gareth after his death or visit him at a chapel of rest. Martinaposs statement stated: We do not feel we have been able to grieve his passing away.

The good news is the government has given permission for hotels with en suite showering facilities, or one designated shower facility per guest room, to reopen. But it has issued strict guidelines for owners to follow in order to keep staff and visitors safe and stop the spread of Covid-. The seven key new rules are designed to help employers, employees and the self-employed in England only understand how to work as safely as possible and protect their customers while keeping to the recommended social distancing guidance applicable at the time. Below are the seven vital changes you will notice next time you stay at a hotel in England...plus we speak to a hotel in Glasgow to see how they have been adapting during the crisis. . Screens in reception  Hotels have been told to take measures to make reception areas safer, with increased cleaning, keeping the activity time as short as possible and where possible the addition of screens between guests and staff. . Lt limits Bosses have been told to consider minimising lt usage from reception, and urged to provide clear signage for new lt rules. . New room service delivery plans Where offering room service, the guidelines state measures such as dropping butler’s trays outside door should be introduced. Hotels are also encouraged to add tips to the bill. . Cleaning checklist for housekeeping  Housekeeping staff must follow government handwashing guidelines, and now make a checklist of all hand contact services to be cleaned when each guests vacates. .

Social distancing at bars Owners must ensure that any bar or dining area is only opened in a way compliant with UK government guidance on the hospitality sector. Hotel supports hospital heroes with meals  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Laura McKenzie had a flood of cancelled bookings at her Glasgow hotel, Cathedral House. The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming! What have we got today ’” The hotel has now delivered more than , dishes such as jambalaya, bangers and mash and Thai curry. “It was a simple menu, all cooked fresh with lots of veggies and the sort of dishes you’d cook for yourself when you get home from work,” says Laura. Doctors staying at the hotel were delighted because Laura would text them to seethey wanted a dinner putting aside – and they could pop down to the kitchen to collect it. Laura’s home-from-home hospitality was a real comfort to her guests."},{"url":null,"title":"how 100 days coronavirus lockdown","story":"NewsHow  days of coronavirus lockdown have changed Britain - maybe forever“Normal” le now means accepting that a trip to the shops means standing, face hidden under a mask, in a socially-distanced queue, or working from home, while home-schooling the kids, or keeping in touch with colleagues and loved-ones on Zoom callsShareCommentsByEmily RetterSenior Feature WriterPoppy Danby:,  JUN Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video woman-wears-full-ppe-go-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news how--days-coronavirus-lockdown-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Things we took for granted – the night out at the pub, trip to the cinema, mini-break in a European capital – belong in the past. Even our vocabulary has changed, words like shielding, self-isolation, the R number and lockdown itself now common.The Oxford English Dictionary added  coronavirus words, including “elbow bump”, in April.Here are some other ways the lockdown has changed Britain in the past  days.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereFinance With shops closed and long queues at supermarkets, more Brits than ever started doing their shopping online, or buying their groceries local. One in five British households bought groceries online in the past month, pumping up sales for home delivery by %, while small independent stores rang up % more sales in the three months to  June, according to analysts Kantar. Nearly half of debit card transactions are now made online, while older generations in particular have seen their internet spending rise, to % of transactions from just % a year ago. And with cash seen as a potential vector for spreading the virus, and the contactless limit raised to £, the decline of cash has accelerated too. Withdrawals from ATM fell as much as % year on year during the lockdown, according to data from cash machine network, Link. But while nearly two million UK households are set to emerge from restrictions better off after saving money, those with incomes less than £, are more likely to have borrowed money and face a dficult future. Economy  And figures have now shown the UK economy shrank .% between January and March, the joint largest fall since . The International Monetary Fundwarns the world is set to take a £. trillion Covid- hit, and Britain’s economy will plunge by .% in . Some experts say we should expect levels of unemployment of three million or more, while the Centre for Retail Research predicts as many as , shops could close this year. Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston are just some of those hit hard already. Workers furloughed fear redundancy once employers need to start paying some of their wages in August. Meanwhile, the way we work may have changed forever. Many have seen the benefits to work-le balance of working from home and video calls, with , working parents surveyed by Bright Horizons showing only around one in eight want toto pre-pandemic ‘normal’. One in  business premises in London have already permanently closed. Communication  We’ve all had to find new ways to communicate. Unknown to most before lockdown, millions are now familiar with video conferencing app Zoom, which by the end of April had over million daily meeting participants. And older people have also become tech-savvy, with % of elderly residents in of parts of the UK regularly using Zoom, WhatsApp and FaceTime to connect with loved ones.Lockdown has also given us the chance to meet our neighbours – whether it’s saying “hello” over the garden fence, going into the street to clap for carers, or getting together in community Whatsapp groups and Facebook pages.However, social media has had its downsides, with a study finding that those who believed in conspiracy theories were more likely to get Covid- information from Facebook or YouTube. Of those, % believed coronavirus was created in a lab and % claimed it didn’t exist at all. Sport  When the Premier League restarted on June  there were cheers from football fans across the country. And no more so than when Liverpool won their first Premier League title in  years. But things were far from normal as matches took place behind closed doors and fans could pay to have a cardboard cut-out of themselves in the stadium seats of their favourite team. And imagine telling a football fan back in January that they’d be able to use the red button to turn fake crowd noises on and off during a match Meanwhile, while some big events such Royal Ascot and the darts PDC tour were given the green light to go ahead, others, such as Wimbledon and the Olympics were forced to reschedule.Relationships  More than % of people say that lockdown has had a positive effect on their lives. And, of these respondents, more than half said they were able to spend more quality time with the loved ones they lived with. Meanwhile, absence has made the heart grow fonder and helped us appreciate family members more than ever. And % of new couples say the pandemic has made their relationship stronger. But there’s been some hurdles to overcome. Parents have been homeschooling their kids for  days. Yet only % of working class parents feel confident in doing so. And sadly, there’s been a % increase in orce inquiries. The Environment  This was our lockdown silver lining. Studies found daily global carbon dioxide emissions fell by % compared with  levels thanks to the shut down of industry and traffic at the start. As le stilled, wildle began reclaiming the empty spaces. Goats took to the streets of Llandudno, buzzards ed to Hampstead Heath and after the National Trust closed their properties, rangers reported rare animal sightings. While CO levels still rose, reaching . parts per million in May - .ppm higher than the peak of .ppm in  - scientists say that without Covid-, the rise might have reached .ppm. NHS and key workers  The nation’s clap – or pan rattle – for carers, thanking our NHS, social care and key workers, became strict Thursday night routine. Rainbows in our windows thanked them. As many of us worked from home, we appreciated others were taking a risk to support us and save lives. After the Prime Minister himself thanked the NHS for saving his own, our health service can surely never be undervalued again. But too many workers paid with their lives. Most – some analysis suggests % - from BAME groups. Schools universities  Parents tried their best to homeschool, but four in ten pupils across England have not been in regular contact with their teachers since schools shut. Another report estimates around one in five UK pupils have done no schoolwork or managed less than an hour a day. While seven out of  state school pupils have had just one online lesson or less per day, almost a third of private schools have been providing four or more, exposing a widening gap between the rich and poor. Meanwhile, older students, forced to take virtual exams and accept predicted marks, fear downgrades. Many are planning to defer university, too, as online learning and student ‘bubbles’ are considered. Cambridge University has already announced all learning will be online until summer . Politics  The daily press briefing has meant we have seen more of the government than ever. Record numbers of million of us were glued initially – although that later shrunk to million.Meanwhile, confidence in Boris Johnson and the Tories has shrunk, too.At the start of lockdown, three in four Brits agreed with government handling of the pandemic. A recent YouGov poll shows the British government has the lowest domestic approval rating in the world  for its handling of Covid-.The PM’s approval ratings sit at just %, not helped by the revelation his top aide Dominic Cummings flouted lockdown rules. An Opinium poll showed % of voters think Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would be better at leading the country, compared to % for Boris.Hobbies at home As we’re unable to go out, we’ve had to find new ways to amuse ourselves. Flour production had to increase  fold to keep up with the surge in home baking. And, by April, there were over .million photos tagged “sourdough” on Instagram.Lockdown has also given us the time to start those tedious household jobs and the three-hour long queue outside Ikea and BQ showed just how much DIY we had to do. We’ve also been making the most of home comforts, with slipper sales doubling in some stores, such as John Lewis and a % increase in TV viewing. Meanwhile, for those who wanted a bit of fun there have been countless Zoom quizzes, and the sale of alcohol at supermarkets soared. For animal lovers, working from home has also provided the perfect opportunity to get a pet – with online searches for getting a puppy surging %. Exercise  Gyms closing saw theof the home workout. Many elite gyms, such as Barry’s Bootcamp and Rebel started streaming their classes on social media for free.Before lockdown, few people had heard of Joe Wicks, who has given millions of children the taste of a daily exercise routine, while celebrities such as Tyson Fury, Naomi Campbell and Gregg Wallace, also started sharing their workout regimes with fans.Perhaps the most unlikely motivator was Boris Johnson, who announced lockdown urging people to exercise once a day. A Bupa study found that % of Brits have upped their usual exercise and bike sales have increased by %. On the down side, .million eager exercisers have injured themselves during lockdown, with men twice as likely as women to get hurt. Royals  Despite not being able to attend public engagements, the Royals have made sure to maintain their duties by switching to video calls during lockdown.

The popular tourist attraction will open its doors on July  for the first time in more than three months as lockdown measures ease in England. Pictures taken from inside the park show guests will have a completely dferent experience. Like zoos, anyone wanting to visit Alton Towers will have to pre-book for entry, with the park opening at limited capacity. Queues will be spaced out to ensure people are social distancing, and face masks will be compulsory for anyone over the age of six on certain rides, including Nemesis, Galactica, Oblivion, The Smiler, Wicker Man, Rita, THTEEN and Runaway Mine Train. At the park entrance, temperature checks will be carried out with a non-touch thermometer. Anyone with a temperature over . degrees will be denied entry.The majority of rides and outdoor attractions will reopen, but some indoor facilities will stay shut, BirminghamLive reports.Staff will also wear PPE and rides will be thoroughly cleaned regularly.  Last month, incredible drone footage showed an eerily empty Alton Towers as operators worked on the rides at dizzying heights.

The Alton Towers website reads: In line with the latest Government guidance, we are delighted to confirm that Alton Towers Resort will reopen on the  July . We can’t wait to welcome you back.This follows the successful opening of the Alton Towers Gardens earlier this month, and is in line with the UK Government guidance on the reopening of open-air attractions.  From  July, the rest of the theme park will reopen, including the majority of our rides and outdoor attractions, although some indoor facilities must remain closed for now.  We will reopen with signicantly reduced numbers and a range of hygiene and safety measures to protect you and our employees.All guests must bring a suitable mask with them when they visit our attraction. Only securely fitted face masks should be worn on rides for safety reasons and we would recommend removing face masks on water rides in case they get wet.

Unlike many royals before her, she opted for looks which really showed off her beautul growing bump, and she was glowing at every engagement she attended while waiting for little Archie to arrive. However a new book has claimed that not everybody was so impressed by her maternity wardrobe, and says some of her looks earned her a stern telling off. In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett write: There were considerable rumblings over Meghan’s appearance. In the early days of the pregnancy, insiders said that Meghan had earned a stern telling-off. However Meghanaposs fashionable look didnapost come cheap, and the Duchessapos maternity wardrobe - featuring  outfits - reportedly cost £,.While there were a couple of high street items showcased, for the most part, Meghanaposs maternity wear was high-end - and had the price tag to match. According to lovethesales Meghanaposs top brands during her pregnancy have been Aquazzura, Givenchy, Stuart Weitzman and Outland Denim.  This figure is said to be seven times the amount the Duchess of Cambridge spent on her pregnancy wardrobe. However itaposs believed the tax paying public do NOT foot her and Kateaposs clothes bill. As well as having wealth in her own right, Meghanaposs wardrobe will also be paid for out of a privy income provided by Prince Charlesapos Duchy of Cornwall.  In the book, which is released later this month, Howard and Tillett also claim that Meghanaposs pregnancy announcement raised a few eyebrows, and reportedly left Harry embarrassed.The couple told the world they were expecting their first child on the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, but shared the happy news with close family at the Harryaposs cousinaposs wedding a few days before.

In a family update posted on YouTube the pregnant teenager is surprised by her family with an influx of gts for her baby. Millie announced her pregnancy just weeks before ‘supermum’ Sue, , welcomed baby Heidie. And the teen is actually holding her sister when the presents come into the family living room. She soon bursts into tears and is comforted by mum Sue. Her first gt is some cushions spelling out her daughteraposs name. The next is a handbag before her mum helps her out with scissors so she can open a pram that will be used by baby Ophelia. There is some assembly required but lucky Millie will have  pairs of hands to help out and she even jokes I bet we know how to put a pram up! Even two-year-old Archie is on hand to help out. In the adorable video Millieaposs many younger siblings can be seen playing with the boxes and helping her to unpack her gts. As they unwrap parts of the pram Sue asks: Do you like it  Millie replies: Yeah I love it.It doesnapost take the family too long to put the pram together.Millie announced her pregnancy in March and admitted she didnapost think falling pregnant aposwould be so easyapos - despite her mumaposs huge brood.She also revealed that while she and Opheliaaposs dad are no longer together, he is going to be a part of her le. The teenager, whose six-month relationship with the babyaposs father has ended, told The Sun: “We didn’t use protection.

Millie, who still lives in crowded family home in Morecambe, Lancashire, added in March: “It’s weird that my baby will have an aunt who is only five months older.

She used her clothes to send statements to royal watchers, and in the lead up to her royal wedding to Charles she used her jewellery to show just how in love she was. Search through the archive today and - before the photos of her single days, her charity work and happily playing with sons William and Harry - youaposll find a young, soon-to-be princess with a strange accessory. There are photographs of Lady Diana Spencer from the days leading up to her wedding to Prince Charles in which she is wearing two watches on one wrist Of course, one of them was hers - a pretty, delicate metallic watch with a thin strap. The other, more masculine, watch with a chunky brown leather strap belonged to Prince Charles. At the time she was snapped wearing the watches, the couple were engaged and got married later that month. And thereaposs a sweet reason for the doubling up of accessories.  The image was taken while the young Diana was watching Prince Charles play polo at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor, during July . She put on Charlesapos watch as a tribute to him and to wish him good luck, according to Marie Claire. However insiders have claimed that things werenapost as perfect behind the scene as everyone believed, and Dianaaposs fears about Charlesaposs ex Camilla started before they said their vows. Insiders say she frequently asked Charles about the nature of their close bond in their lead up to their Royal Wedding in . But her heart was shattered just a few days before she said her vows when she walked into his private secretary Michael Colborneaposs office. She saw a package sitting on the desk with Camillaaposs name written on it, and demanded to see what was inside of it. She found a gold bracelet engraved with the letters G and F, which stood for Gladys and Fred - the nicknames Charles and Camilla used for each other. Speaking in Channel  documentary, Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding, biographer Christopher Wilson said: I think she was very suspicious of anything Camilla. She asked to see what was inside and eventually she was allowed to have her way. She was absolutely in tears, in a terrible state about it. It was clear that this was Prince Charlesapos farewell present to Camilla.

This comes just weeks after Black Lives Matter protestors took down a statue of the th century slave trader in the city and dumped it in the harbour. The owners of the St Michaelaposs Hill pub are currently on the hunt for a new permanent name for the establishment, reports Bristol Live.Theyaposve invited the public to help choose the new name, but in the meantime have placed a banner over the door, proclaiming that it will temporarily be called Ye olde Pubby McDrunkface. Honestly, we donapost think we could come up with a better namewe tried. Paul Frost, the landlord of the pub, said: There hasnapost been a lot of chatter about our name since the statue came down, but I thought weaposd be inundated with suggestions. We thought weaposd give the pub a temporary name to kick off some discussion about it and get the ball rolling. The -year-old, who also runs The Langton in St Annes continued: The name we went for is a nod to Boaty McBoatface. I wanted to go simply with Pubby McPubface but my manager Josh suggested Ye olde Pubby McDrunkface, which is much better. The sign, which was designed by pub manager Josh Louis and printed by Vistaprint, was put up outside on June  and has garnered plenty of smiles from passers-by and people whoaposve spotted it on social media.  It says: The Clearly Temporarily Named Ye Olde Pubby McDrunkface. Suggestions welcome . Underneath the sign is a board that reads: We are listening. Black Lives Matter. Frost added that he will spend time listening to all name suggestions as he doesnapost want to rush this decision. Thereaposs been a good jovial response to the new name which is nice to see.

Craig Harker, who runs The George Pub and Grill in Stockton, is looking to fill five positions at three pubs after the government announced bars and restaurants would be able to reopen their doors on July .The roles for bar staff, a kitchen chef, a pot washer and an apprentice front of house were posted on social media and racked up hundreds of comments - but it was the wording of the advert which attracted attention, as reported by Teeside Live.Serving up a taste of whataposs to come, Craig begins the advert by stating: Yes youaposll be working for an a***hole but who isnapost these days lol but Iaposm a fair one and everyone who works for me enjoys being at work. He advises anyone hopeful of landing a role to show up smart and presentable, adding: Dont come to an interview with your chipped finger nails, scraggly hair and just been on a session red eye. Come looking to impress me. If you come and your clothes are creased to bits then I wont be having your lazy a*** anywhere behind my bar. Before you come downyou feel your breath is a little tangy then it probably is, get yourself a tic tac before your burn my eyes.  In the description for a bar person, it states anyone with banter like a aposwet flannelapos should look where because I donapost have the time or patience to teach someone how to be sociable just because youaposve played Call of duty for the last  years instead of having proper mates. For the same role in another pub, applicants are told professional experience is essential, not home bar experience or the fact you made everyone a jager bomb in the park using crisp packets. Although thataposs creative itaposs not what Iaposm after. The advert for a pot washer reads: Yep itaposs one of those grubby jobs but you get good pot washers and s**** ones. Iaposm after a good one. Pot wash athletes only.

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.

Unfortunately I think we should. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places, he said. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks. But how exactly will local lockdowns be decided and forced  And what will it look like to be in a city forced into local lockdown  How the local lockdown will work in Leicester Leicester is the first place where a local lockdown has been implemented - and here are the changes that have happened in the city. The lockdown there seems similar to the rules imposed UK-wide at the end of March. People in Leicester must once again “stay at home as much as you can” and cease non-essential travel.  Yesterday, non-essential shops in Leicester were told they must close all over again. Primary schools which opened to some pupils from June  must once again close, to all but the most vulnerable or children of key workers, from this Thursday. Pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and more in the city will not reopen as in the rest of England on July . And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July .  Why did the lockdown happen in Leicester  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city. He revealed % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester. Residents said people had been widely flouting social distancing and other measures when the government first began easing rules two weeks ago.  I thinkpeople listened and stayed at home, then we wouldnapost be here, said Bob Sharma, a bank manager. Pawn broker Arun Mortala said people had not been wearing masks or keeping distance when back on high streets. I was expecting that this was going to happen, he said.  Could apostargeted actionapos work on specic offices, factories or schools Matt Hancock said the city wide lockdown in Leicester had been imposed because targeted action had failed to work, according to the BBC. But when many coronavirus cases are found in one place, local directors of public health can close the premises. Who makes the decision on when a local lockdown is needed  The BBC says that the local director of public health and the Health and Safety Executive can temporarily shut down a single premises. But in the case of a town, city or region, it is a number of organisations which together decide. Local alerts can be flagged to Englandaposs chief medical officer who can advise a minister.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.  I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost.

If you donapost clean it as you go, the grime and dirt builds up pretty easily, which leads to a lot of hard work later on. Whilst there are a tonne of products and methods online that promise to give you a gleaming oven - like The Pink Stuff Cleaning Paste that Mrs Hinch raves about or baking soda and vinegar - this one is new to us. A savvy mum has revealed just how easy it is to clean your oven without having to spend - what feels like - hours scrubbing it - and all you need is tin foil and a dishwasher tablet. She shared the video to TikTok and avid cleaners praised her for her aposle-changingapos hack. The woman starts by removing the trays from the oven, and then covers them completely in kitchen foil. She then pops them into the bath, before filling it with hot water - just enough to submerge the trays.  Finally, she puts a dishwasher tablet into the bath with the pans and leaves them to soak for two hours. Then you wait. After two hours remove the foil and youaposll be blow away. The once greasy and grotty pans, look brand new.  It might seem like magic but the secret is that a chemical reaction occurs between the foil and the tablets which breaks down all of the dirt. Now youaposll never have to scrub your oven again - genius. And many others thought so too as they praised the woman for sharing the idea. One said: Thank you! This is going to be le changing in my house! Another person in the comments said: You forgot to add: place the aluminium foil shiny side down onto the metal, thatapos the surface that attracts the dirt.

Whilst you may think that scrubbing the spoon with some washing-up liquid and a sponge, or popping it into the dishwasher for a cycle will effectively remove any germs from the utensil, you would be wrong, as this woman found out.She took to Facebook to share a tip she learnt from celebrity Masterchef judge Matt Preston and the revolting results that came with it, reported News.au.She asked Facebook users whether they regularly soak their wooden spoons in boiling water - and it turns out that many people donapost. Although she puts hers in the dishwasher after every use, she found out that this doesnapost stop germs from being absorbed into the wooden spoon, nor does it remove it. She explained that all you have to do to see how dirty your spoon really is, is soak it in a bowl of boiling water for around  minutes. She shared a picture of the offending spoon with the caption: Revolting really - and it definitely was. The water in the bowl was murky, dirty and just downright gross. But what made it worse was the layer of oil that had risen to the surface. A number of amateur chefs were shocked at the results, and said this is why they prefer to use silicone spatulas. One said: No wooden spoons or boards in my kitchen at all for this reason. Another person suggested laying the wooden utensil out in the sun, as it apparently does wonders for bacteria - although weaposre not so surethis is true. But others werenapost so sure as they pointed out that no one had ever been sick from using their wooden spoons. One of which was a woman who claims to have used wooden spoons for decades, and couldnapost see the issue with it.The celebrity chef shared the tip to Delicious magazine a while back and itaposs still shocking people to this day.He explained that whilst the wooden spoon looks clean on the outside, itaposs most probably harbouring some gunk inside.

But combing too hard or even brushing with the wrong hairbrush can cause long-term damage.Hair brand Tangle Teezer has conducted a study to see just how many women are concerned about the damage their doing to their hair, reports the Daily Star.And, the results are in - out of the , women surveyed, four in  are worried that some of their actions are bad for their hair, and more than one in  even admitted to using the old tip to brush your hair  times before bed - yikes. A fth of women believed it was fine to brush their roughly in order to get through any knots or tangles, and a fth admit to sharing a hair brush, which, Tangle Teezer founder Shaun Pulfrey, known as Shaun P, says is a big no-no. One of the biggest mistakes people are making is brushing their hair from the scalp down, which can lead to split ends, more knots and ultimately, damaged hair. Instead you should start at the ends of your hair and work your way up. This ensures that all of the tangles are tackled carefully without ripping any hair out in the process.Shaun P said: It’s worrying to see just how many women are brushing their hair incorrectly and causing unnecessary damage to their hair.No matter what the hair texture, it’s important to use an intelligent hairbrush which is gentle. It’s also concerning that women are using one brush for all tasks, a good way to look at this is you wouldn’t use a foundation brush to apply blusher, so why use a detangling brush to blow dry hair  No matter how tempting it is to pull or cut knots, it’s always best to use a detangling hairbrush. What you shouldnapost be doing - but definitely areAvoiding brushing when itaposs wet over fears this will break the hair Brushing too hard Brushing from the scalp downwards Using an old and worn hairbrush Using a hairbrush that isn’t specically for detangling Sharing a hairbrush Ripping out big knots  tangles instead of gently combing through them Not using a hairbrush specically for your hair type Using a hairbrush that doesn’t have flexible teeth  bristles Using one hairbrush for everythingThe study also found that three quarters of women admitted to using the same hairbrush for all aspects of their hair care. Itaposs vital to use dferent tools for dferent tasks like combing wet hair, detangling and blow drying. And, while  per cent of women only own one or two hairbrushes, a sixth have more than seven make-up brushes. But, although  per cent of women have a specic routine for their locks, more than half admitted they do not knowthey are using the right brush for their hair type. In terms of what products women are using, less than a quarter of those polled regularly use hair masques,  per cent admit to not using any heat protection spray at all and more than a fth apply oils. The biggest concern for women in the UK were split ends,  per cent, frizz,  per cent and thinning hair at  per cent. Shaun P added: We have created dferent brushes and adapted the teeth to suit all hair types, to give the perfect brush for all hair textures – be it afro hair, thick and curly or fine, thinning, fragile and straight.

The line I had pasta tonight is not someone who is talking about what they had for dinner but is instead a cry for help. Other phrases used include I finished my shampoo and conditioner at the same time and are often used by TikTok users. One Reddit user believes the words have been taken from Hannah Dainsapos poem aposDonapost Kill Yourself Todayapos, which explains why a person struggling with depression should choose to stay alive. One line reads “finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time” and another says to “tell someone your best pasta recipe.” Although some TikTok users actually talk about pasta or shampoo, many others post about these items for completely dferent reasons. But the comments to these meaningful posts can be powerful.

She was a strong and very giving lady and everyone she taught loved her.#She was a great role model for everyone she taught and I never saw her bitter or angry.#Doreen was diagnosed with a terminal illness seven weeks ago and was told only four days later that there was no treatment available.Linda said: #I had to get special permission to come home to be with her and she was absolutely delighted when I made it. I was so worried I wouldn#t be able to get here. I#m so glad I got to be with her at the end.#She was delighted when on June  the girls from the Dundee Sparkletts twirling group managed to get along to see her through the window.#She had a dferent story for each of the girls, that#s just what she was like. She was so uncomplaining about everything.#I am a nurse back home in Australia and I can honestly say she was the easiest patient I have ever had.#Doreen grew up in Downfield, the daughter of Tom Donaldson, who ran a bakery in Haldane.She began competitive dancing at a very young age and started teaching when she was .Doreen#s first love had been Highland dancing, which took her all over the world including Russia, America, China, Turkey and Italy as well as to other European cities.Linda said: #She was heavily involved in cultural dance exchanges.

This should involve a referendum designed in Scotland where a last invitation is offered to the UK to participate to put the case to remain in the union.#A request to the EU to sanction this referendum should be made and every attempt to involve them in the designing of that referendum should be pursued.#mdash Pete WishartJune , Mr Wishart#s preference is to secure an #irrefutable mandate# by winning a majority at next year#s Holyrood election with a #clear and unambiguous commitment to hold a referendum#, and then #move quickly# with the participation of the UK.However, he believessuch a mandate is rejected, Scotland should seek approval from the EU to design a process for rejoining as a #substate# # despite there being no current provision for this within the body#s existing rules.The influential MP also wants Scotland to look at #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state# and informally acquire responsibilities currently exercised by the UK Government, which could include withdrawing from institutions at Westminster.#What we have to demonstrate is that we have tried absolutely everything possible to secure the UK as a participant in resolving the question of our democratic right to consider our nation’s future,# Mr Wishart said.#We have to conclusively convince the EU and the international community that no stone has been left unturned in trying to engage them as a partner in resolving this democratically and constitutionally.#Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union hit out at Mr Wishart for spending time on the #route map# and called for him to instead to focus efforts on tackling the coronavirus crisis.She said: #It tells you everything about the SNP that Pete Wishart#s priority is a route map to separation, rather than a route map to economic recovery for the people of Scotland.#Even before the coronavirus crisis, the SNP#s blueprint for leaving the UK acknowledged there would be economic hardship # now it would be manestly worse.#The majority of people want their elected representatives to focus on bringing people together as we face the harsh reality of a deep recession with many job losses.#It#s also vital to remember that at election time people vote for parties on a wide range of issues. Pete#s proposal is therefore a non-starter and he should instead focus his efforts on representing all his constituents at this dficult time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He is a victim of this global pandemic.“It is a tough one for me and the players but it is even tougher for Jimmy and Cammy, who has also left the club.“It is an absolute gutter for the two of them. But no one could have predicted how this virus would affect clubs like ours.”The Dark Blues are all but certain to promote first-team coach Dave Mackay to take over as number two but no decision has been made yet.McPake made the point that he has other things on his mind right now.“I think it is too early to say what will happen,” said McPake.“Thatis not what’s in my head just now.“What I am thinking about is losing members of staff due to cost-cutting measures.”McPake yesterday confirmed he will not be involved in pay cut talks between the club and its players.The Dark Blues’ squad members have been asked to agree to salary reductions of around % and while Meekings said no and headed off to pastures new, experienced midfielder Paul McGowan has gone the other way and agreed to stay.McPake stressed it will be up to iniduals to do what is best for themselves and their families, and the pay discussions will be done at managing director level by John Nelms.He said: “I can confirm that there have been talks about deductions but that’s for iniduals and that’s way above me.“That’s something that I am not really involved in and, evenI were, it wouldn’t be fair for me to speak about as we are talking about people’s livelihoods and salaries.“Cuts have been offered but what each inidual’s cut is, that’s private between them and whoever is dealing with it at the club.“It will just be inidualised. Theymay come back to the club with dferent ideas, I don’t know.“They might all come back and say yes or they might say no. It is a tough one for me to predict and, as for a deadline, I genuinely don’t know.”Askedthe coaching staff had also been asked to take a pay cut, the Dens boss replied: “That’s not something I will go into.”As for Meekings, there were definitely no hard feelings towards the defender from his now former gaffer.McPake added: “Meeks is gone and that’s a shame because he did great for me as captain of this club.“He was offered a deal and it was his choice to say whether it was acceptable or not.“He chose to reject it but I wish him well for the future.“It is sad to see him go but I fully understand decisions that people make, particularly under the circumstances we are in with the pandemic.“I have no bad words to say about him at all.”On a brighter note, McPake was understandably upbeat regarding McGowan’s decision to say yes to his new terms.He said: “I am delighted that he committed himself to the club.“Gowser is a leader without even realising he is a leader.“He might moan a lot on the pitch at times but that is because he has high standards and he is often the one to express an opinion when he thinks the players are not hitting those high standards.“At times like these, you need people with character at your club and Gowser certainly has that.“He never shirks responsibility and that is why he has such real affinity with the Dundee fans.“I think the talks with him were over and done within a day or so.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

His experience is vast and will have a whole host of good contacts, not just up here and down south, but in Holland and across Europe.His appointment would be an exciting one for United and, indeed, the entirety of Scottish footballhe were to rock up at Tannadice.McClaren could help the club kick on to the next level – and that gives me an indication of how the club are looking at things.There has been some questions raised about finances at United but owner Mark Ogren wouldn’t be allowing sporting director Tony Asghar to go chasing guys like Mackay and McClarenhe were unsure.Compensation will have to be paid for Mackay and McClaren is going to be used to big wages.If there were any issues with money, you’d think the Terrors would be taking options like Tommy Wright or Lee McCulloch who, no offence to them, will be on the cheaper end of the scale.I think you have to take the moves being made by United as a positive. Only time will tell whether they get the right man or not.Paul McGowan is exactly the type of player Dundee are going to need in their dressing-room next season.So it was good to see Gowser agree a new contract last week.That he took up the new deal on greatly-reduced terms shows his commitment to the club and aThat kind of attitude is invaluable among a squad of players, particularly in testing times like this.Club captain Josh Meekings leaves Dundee after contract talks breakdown\" title\"#Club captain Josh Meekings leaves Dundee after contract talks breakdown# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp josh-meekings-leaves-dundee embed # secretzhTQpl\" data-secret\"zhTQpl\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"With the Dark Blues asking players to take wage cuts of up to %, what McGowan has done is shown the lead.Hopefully, his influence can convince others to make some short-term sacrices,affordable, for the benefit of the club.With skipper Josh Meekings now having joined No  Jimmy Nicholl in leaving Dens, Dundee will need as many experienced campaigners to stick around as they can.I wouldn’t be surprised to see McGowan take on the club captaincy from Meekings next season.Whatever ision they end up in for next season, Hearts’ signing of Craig Gordon is a real signal of intent.In bringing the Scotland goalkeeper back to Gorgie, the Jambos are really flexing their muscles for either a tilt at the Championship title next term, which would be tough for Dundee, or another Premiership campaign.At , he’ll feel he’s got a few good years left in the tank and will be looking to play every single week.The way it worked out, it was a wee bit of an anti-climax Liverpool winning the league.It would’ve been better for them to have won it while playing and in front of their fans but, even still, what a season they had!Dundee boss James McPake says it’s irrelevanthe and old Dundee United rival Robbie Neilson face off for Championship title next season\" title\"#Dundee boss James McPake says it’s irrelevanthe and old Dundee United rival Robbie Neilson face off for Championship title next season# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-dundee-united-james-mcpake-robbie-neilson-hearts embed # secretbuqzzIdw\" data-secret\"buqzzIdw\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We’ve seen increases across Childline’s messaging boards, with young people connecting via our online community and helping each other to cope.Children supporting and shaping each other during this crisis is very powerful, and helps children feel like they are not completely alone or unique.The response from Childline’s volunteers has also been incredible and their dedication is overwhelming. We know that at a challenging time like this, in which the spread of coronavirus has caused schools, youth and public services to close, it’s more important than ever to consider the support that is in place for our young people.To help us continue to support children during this challenging period, and to adapt to the ever- changing situation, the NSPCC has launched its emergency appeal ‘We’re still here for children’. If you would like to donate, please visit www.justgiving fundraising nspccscotYoung people can get help from Childline at www.childline.org.uk or by calling   for free.

But when asked what new money will be given to the Scottish Government at the daily press briefing, the prime minister#s official spokesperson laughed.#That#s what this Government thinks about funding for the Scottish economy # jobs, families and livelihoods, they think it#s a joke.#Is the prime minister capable of answering a direct question and I don#t want the usual waffle, it#s a straightforward question # What are the new Barnett consequentials coming to Scotland as result of yesterday#s speech #Mr Johnson responded: #I think he probably does the spokesman in question a serious injustice because I don#t believe that he would have taken this issue anything other than seriously.#He should wait until next week to have the full Barnett consequentials for what we#re outlining.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"primary-school-galashiels-records-bruno-mars-cover","story":"A GALASHIELS primary school has recorded its own version of a Bruno Mars song to mark the

so-called air bridges to popular destinations.Since March , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised British nationals against all but essential international travel.Now, a number of short-haul flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.This is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being trialled at Manchester Airport, in which passengers can reserve a free -minute window to use a dedicated lane taking them directly to a checkpoint."},{"url":null,"title":"find-man-king-street","story":"HAILED by their neighbours as the

This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

We know that the children being worst hit by this time out of school are those from the least privileged backgrounds.The council is working to try to get children back to school but the current government proposals are not acceptable.They aim for the majority of primary schools to have  per cent of pupils attending at any one time and some primary schools to have only  per cent of pupils attending at a time.In our high schools it is a similar story of, at best, having only  per cent of pupils attending at any one time.Part of the issue is that Scottish Government guidance on two-metre social distancing massively limits the number of children who can be in class at any one time.Of course, as we have seen this week, confusion exists in the government as to how education will be delivered in the long term any- way.John Swinney explained that the proposed blended learning arrangements are likely to last for most of the next academic year, only for Nicola Sturgeon to suggest these proposals are merely a contingency plan.This uncertainty creates many dficulties as we plan.For example, how do we get children to school from home The council currently provides transport to get children to schools but, as stands, it will not be sufficient and will need to be radically increased in scope.Council officers suggest that this could mean the cost ballooning to ldquoin excess of pound. million and therefore well beyond existing resource levels, in part due to the two-metre social distancing requirement.But, even with a smaller distance, there will still be signicant dficulty in our schools.We should look at utilising other public buildings such as community centres and sports halls for education purposes.However, this then comes to the crux of the matter: there are signicant resourcing issues with reopening schools.The Scottish Government has asked councils and schools to operate and act in new and radical ways but has not come forward in a meaningful way to assist them.The Scottish Government must help us fund the cost of transporting children to school and help to fund the opening up of other public buildings.Providing an education to our children here in East Lothian needs to be among our very highest priorities.That is why my Conservatives colleagues on the councilrsquos education committee, which is meeting this week, will be pushing officers to try to get children back in school sooner and quicker."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-east-linton-enjoys-stay-home-gala","story":"The gala committee were forced to cancel the annual day, due to take place on Saturday, June , but decided instead to hold a socially distant event instead.With the theme of Masquerade, locals decorated their homes and planned to have picnics in their gardens and wear masks.Sadly the rain meant most picnics were unable to go ahead but the local fire crew arrived and drove through the village streets handing out treats provided by the committee.Children were encouraged to draw pictures of a fire engine and put them on display at their homes to attract the firefighters attention and families turned out to wave to the crew with some some lucky youngsters even given the chance to climb into the fire engine cab.Station Commander David Ward, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: ldquoWe were delighted that members of our crew at East Linton Fire Station could take part in their community gala.\"With so many gala days and local events cancelled, itrsquos great to see people come together in this way to try and create something positive for the local community, and children especially.

Some pupils may have learnt new skills and may be rethinking their path because of new experiences and we look forward to hearing about those experiences.ldquoMore importantly, we look forward to welcoming our children back to school and are excited to see them again in August.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos wellbeing, praised the efforts of parents, carers and teaching staff during lockdown.She said: ldquoStaff across our schools especially our headteachers have been working tirelessly and around the clock to pull together plans based on government advice.ldquoMany parents and carers will be pleased to hear that schools will be going back full-time in August.

Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken

moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

But that doesnrsquot mean there is public support for the type of hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and his Brexiters want. In fact, a recent Kantar poll found % of UK voters now back remaining in the EU. But the UK has left the EU, so \"remain\" is not possible ndash only a rather unlikely re-join option .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"description\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DtdhjwmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DtdhjwmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Kirsty Hughes: Scotland needs to start working now to cement its Euro credentialsBut, in Scotland, the re-join option is not so unlikely nor absent from debate. Independence in the European Union is the Scottish Governmentrsquos clear, long-standing position. Any independent European state can indeed apply to join the EU ndash and despite plenty of hoops to jump through, there is, for now, plenty of goodwill in EU capitals towards Scotland.Meanwhile, in London, Keir Starmer is playing a cautious game on the EU-UK talks ndash hanging back, unlike the other opposition parties, from calling for a two-year extension of transition. Doubtless, Starmer will be ready to critique any basic free trade deal that emerges. But he is playing a long game, and any clear position on Labourrsquos preferred EU-UK deal is not obviously in the offing.In contrast, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit policies are many and ied ndash from independence in the EU to keeping the whole UK in the EUrsquos customs union and single market, or keeping Scotland alone in the single market, or devolving migration policy to enable something akin to free movement of people.But, with deliberate continuity from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the UK Government has chosen not to engage in any serious way with the devolved administrations. May and Johnson never tried to mend the Brexit ide across the UKrsquos four nations ndash their focus was solely on their core voters and their own backbenchers.So the Brexit fragmentation of the UK has deepened over the last four years, not least since Brexit day on January . Scotland not only voted Remain, together with Northern Ireland, four years ago, but the European debate here remains substantively dferent too.And itrsquos a debate that is intimately intertwined with the independence debate. A recent poll put support for independence at % ndash others have shown a smaller majority or a : split. One factor behind the increase in support for independence is previously pro-UK, Remain voters switching to Yes. While the Conservatives drive Brexit forward and Labour has accepted it, in Scotland, the SNPrsquos option of re-joining the EU will stay a core part of political debate and dynamics.This fundamental dference in English and Scottish political debates is there too in the more specic aspects of the EU-UK talks. The UK Government continues to reject EU demands for a level-playing field to ensure neither side undercuts the other on environmental and labour standards or state aids. Johnsonrsquos agreement, in last autumnrsquos EU-UK political declaration, to negotiate a level-playing field has been discarded by this most ideological of governments.:Kirsty Hughes: Brexit, lies and the Johnson charadeBut the Scottish Government wants its own partial level-playing field in devolved areas, including replicating EU environmental standards as far as possible. How that will play out in the context of other UK trade deals or in UK-devolved politics is an open question.The EU-UK talks are also blocked over fisheries, over judicial and police co-operation, and on overall governance and dispute settlement. Any hints of progress on the technical side in the talks are soon halted by new political pronouncements from London. And consultation between UK and Scottish governments remains non-existent beyond some granular technical discussions between officials.Yet, despite the UK bluster, a deal is perhaps slightly more likely than a no deal outcome. If London can portray a major compromise on its side, with a small sht by Brussels, as EU capitulation, then late October might see a deal ndash allowing time for the European parliament to raty it.But a deal will be thin and damaging. It will re-establish customs and regulatory barriers to trade it will hit the services sector particularly hard. It will slow growth and reduce investment compared to staying closer to the EU. And a no deal outcome will create more chaos and a harder economic hit ndash albeit with the withdrawal agreement still in place, so EU citizensrsquo settled status and the special deal for Northern Ireland will remain.A UK publicity campaign is due in July ndash pushing iniduals and organisations to prepare for the end of transition. But such preparations cannot realistically be done amidst the economic damage and uncertainty from the Covid- crisis, and without knowingthere will be a deal or what it will look like.The double damage from the Covid crisis and a hard Brexit plus premature end of transition will not go unnoticed in Scotland. The SNP faces its own challenges in the months ahead, as the fall-out from the Salmond saga continues. And currently favourable polls for the Holyrood elections next May could sht in our deeply unpredictable Covid era.But the UK, albeit with a special deal for Northern Ireland, is set for a hard orce from the EU. In Scotland, the debate over having that orce imposed on it will continue. The EU debate may be muted in England in the coming years.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers. They do not have the confidence to hire staff, they do not have the confidence to buy stock and consumables to feed people.ldquoTo ramp up to open you have to spend money that there is no guarantee you will get back.He added: ldquoEvenit [tourism] is back up and running [businesses are worried] they wonrsquot have enough revenue to cover costs.The timetable brought in by CalMac on Sunday increases the number of daily sailings undertaken by the MV Caledonian Isles between Ardrossan and Brodick to five from two, and restores a service on Sundays, with four sailings on those days. However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Why the Border must regain its old role as the country   s first line of defence","story":"Yet she is clearly unsettled at the idea of some kind of checkpoint on the A, A, or whichever route she might take. Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

Are we not allowed to criticise anything the Israeli state might endorse  Are we not allowed, for example, to criticise Israeli settlement expansion into the West Bank as de facto occupation of territory that is not theirs  Are we not allowed to even suggest that Israeli policy towards Palestinians might have unpleasant similarities with South-African apartheid  Is this anti-Semitic The debate about what constitutes anti-Semitism has long been getting out of hand.Trevor Rigg, Edinburgh EH."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9954347.jpg?type=article-full","title":"movie-director-richard-curtis-co-founds-ethical-pensions-campaign-ahead-glasgow-climate-summit","story":"The film writer, producer and director who had a majorhand in hit movies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually is fronting a move to sht the money out of industries that are harming people and into sustainable businesses.It comes as a new poll shows that nearly three in four Scots either do not believe or do not know whether their pension is invested in line with their values.:Glasgow councillors delay decision on esting pension fund from fossil fuel firmsAnd while around  million working Britons are saving into a pension fund the campaign says the research shows that only pound out of every pound is invested in \"responsible and impactful\" enterprises.Make My Money Matter describes itself as ldquoa people-powered campaign that is looking to ramp up public demand for investments that do good and help with the transition towards a zero-carbon world.The campaign includes the Scotland-based Ethical Finance Hub, which is calling on public sector pension schemes in Scotland to commit to investing in line with the Scottish Governmentrsquos ambitions to create a greener, fairer and healthier country and show leadership as the country prepares to host COP.It comes amid growing unrest over public sector pension funds investing in fossil fuels.In March the Strathclyde Pension Fundconcluded that esting from oil and gas firms is not an ldquoeffective or satisfactory solution to climate change in a review of itrsquos fossil fuel investments.At that point, the fund which is managed by Glasgow City Council, had an estimated poundm invested in fossil fuel companies.That is despite the fact that Glasgow City Councilrsquos own Climate Emergency Group recommended getting out of all funding of fossil fuels in a report aiming to make the city carbon neutral by .:Groundbreaking Scots investment bond to help unlock poundbn to protect rare species and environmentClimate change activists made their concerns known by acting out deaths at Glasgow City Chambers in a protest over the investments made by the fund which provides pensions to  councils in the west of Scotland.Mr Curtis launched Make My Money Matter at an event alongside Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, and Helen Dean, chief executive of Nest, the UKrsquos largest pension provider.Ahead of COP in Glasgow in , the initiative is calling on the pensions industry to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by .The campaign claims that over the past few decades, while investing in many vital businesses, UK pension funds ldquohave also been fuelling some of the most unsustainable and exploitative industries on the planet, from tobacco to fossil fuels, arms manufacturing to gambling.But Make My Money Matter said it was not a estment campaign, and was not explicitly asking people to switch their pension.Instead, it wanted to ldquostart a conversation and create more transparency about where peoplersquos money was being invested, what their options were, and what action funds were taking to help tackle the climate crisis.Campaign co-founder Mr Curtis, who started up Comic Relief, which has raised more than poundbn for projects in Africa and the UK, said: ldquoOur pensions are powerful, and we must use that power to build a better world.ldquoThe pound trillion in our UK pension pot is more than enough to take on the climate emergency, bring hundreds of new drugs to market, or help solve the housing crisis.ldquoBut from tobacco to fossil fuels, gambling to deforestation, pension funds have invested trillions on our behalf without asking us the crucial question ndash do these investments create a world that we actually want to live in ldquoThat is why Make My Money Matter will help people understand their lsquofinancial footprintrsquo and empower us all to have pensions we can be proud of.ldquoIn doing so, we hope to mobilise real public engagement on the power of our money ahead of COP in Scotland.A new YouGov poll found that nearly a thirdof people with a pension say that they now care more about the impact of how their pension is invested on people and the planet compared with the start of the pandemic. Over halfof want to see their pensions invested in building a better future for people and the planet post-coronavirus.Previous research by the Ethical Finance Hub found that only % of Scots who have

The project has grown out of recent patterns whereby once remote destinations in the Arctic and northern European countries have become more accessible to tourists.The growth of the expedition cruise industry, cheaper accommodation and an increase in flights have all contributed to this trend. Visitors to these regions are often curious, drawn to less-visited parts of the world to experience and learn about somewhere that is off the beaten track.Now places like the isle of Arran and Assynt in Wester Ross could become international destinations alongside Iceland and Lapland with tourists keen to learn about science of a local area.Project manager Ari Laakso from the University of Lapland said ldquoTravellers want to understand and learn about what they see and experience. Often, tourists will visit a museum, a science centre or a culturally interesting venue to learn more about natural phenomena, but why not take this a step further  This new tourism concept would focus on utilising and communicating science in a fun and hands-on fashion, exploring a certain topic or place.ldquoScientists have always travelled to remote places for study and research.

Weak competition in search and social media leads to reduced innovation and choice, as well as to consumers giving up more data than they would like.\"Further,the poundbn spend in the UK last year on digital advertising is higher than it would be in a more competitive market, this will be felt in the prices for hotels, flights, consumer electronics, books, insurance and many other products that make heavy use of digital advertising. The CMA found that Googlersquos prices are around % to % higher than Bing when comparing like-for-like search terms on desktop and mobile.\"It said that Google and Facebookrsquos market positions also have a profound impact on newspapers and other publishers.The CMA found that newspapers are reliant on Google and Facebook for almost % of all visits to their sites.\"This dependency potentially squeezes their share of digital advertising revenues, undermining their ability to produce valuable content,\" it said.The CMA has proposed that within the new regime a Digital Markets Unit should have the ability to enforce a code of conduct to ensure that s with a position of market power, like Google and Facebook, do not engage in \"exploitative or exclusionary practices\" or in a manner likely to reduce trust and transparency, and to impose finesnecessary.It wants powers to restrict Googlersquos ability to secure its place as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers in order to introduce more choice for users.The unit should also have powers to insist Facebook give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising.It wants Google to be ordered open up its click and query data to rival search engines to allow them to improve their algorithms so they can properly compete.\"This would be designed in a way that does not involve the transfer of personal data to avoid privacy concerns,\" it said.And it said there should be teeth to insist Facebook increase its \"interoperability\" with competing social media s.The unit would also oversee a ldquofairness-by-design duty on the s to ensure that they are making it \"as easy as possible for users to make meaningful choices\".And it could order the separation of s where necessary to ensure healthy competition.Whilst the recommedations recommendation are UK-focused, many of the problems that the CMA identied were international in nature.So the CMA said it will therefore continue to take a leading role globally in relation to these issues as part of a wider digital strategy."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11540105.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pictures-remembering-princess-diana-scotland-59th-birthday","story":"The Princess of Wales won the hearts of ordinary Scots during her many visits north of the Border.Her charity work, sense of style and dedication to Prince William and Prince Harry made her truly the Peoplersquos Princess.The respect she garnered across the country was put on display following her tragic death in , with thousands of mourners packing out Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh and George Square in Glasgow to pay tribute.Here, we take look back at Princess Dirsquos most memorable moments in Scotland.The Princess of Walesat the Braemar Highland Games on September .Princess Diana visit to Malcolm Sargent house, Prestwick, September .Princess Dianaat Rottenrow Maternity in the early s.Prince Charles points out someting of intrest to Princess Diana at the Braemar Highland Games inSeptember .Princess Diana is presented with a bunch of white heather at the Braemar HighlandGames inSeptember .Prince Charles and Princess Diana on tram at the Glasgow Garden Festival in .Princess Diana meets the people of Possilpark during a walkabout after her visit to the Possil Drugs Project in .Princess Diana at the opening of the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Cathcart.The Queen, the Queen Mother, Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the Braemar Highland Games in .Princess Diana at the Maryhill community Centre in Glasgow in .Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the Glasgow Garden Festival opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmA voucher scheme, which has been seen Orkney Islands Councilgive £ per head per week to travel-restricted islanders, will be extended by another eight weeks.

We’ve been inspired by the care and support members of that community give each other – the comradeship they share is truly a bond of friendship beyond what is typical in civilian le.“During the coronavirus outbreak many veterans’ charities and community groups have created opportunities for veterans to enjoy comradeship using video-conferencing apps.#Our big concern is for those older veterans who are unable or prefer not to use the internet, and so miss out on these opportunities.“Through Comradeship Circles they can now enjoy banter and share memories of military le with each other by phone, in groups of up to six for about an hour, at the same time and on the same day each week.#One of our facilitators will be on hand just in case, but mostly will leave the veterans to speak to each other.”Age Scotland are hoping the Comradeship Circles project will create opportunities for veterans to ‘re-join the tribe’ by telephone.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items.

We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skye-golf-club-sconser.jpg","title":"green for go competitions off and running again at the isle of skye golf","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSomewhat belatedly the competitions have commenced and it was to the ladies section that the honour of opening the season belonged.On a recent blustery Sunday a quartet of quines graced the fairways at Sconser and Sandi Beatson emerged from the pack to steal the headlines on day one.Playing off her #mark# of  two steady halves of  and  saw her record an opening day handicap-reducing gross score of  and an immediate #cut# from  to  so very well played and what a great start to her golfing season.Proxime accessit was Donalda Johnston with a gross score of  in this the first of five rounds to be played for the Ladies Championship.Incidentally in this same competition last year Sandi also recorded a victorious, handicap-reducing score of three under the Competitions Scratch Score* for the day. This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

The Very Rev David Monteith, from Enniskillen, said he wanted to offer a message of support to those now facing added weeks of uncertainty.He also called on the government not to forget the most vulnerable, with many of those testing positive for the virus in Leicester coming from low income and BAMEbackgrounds. The first localised lockdown in the UK was announced after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around % of all positive cases in England were detected there over the last week.Non-essential shops have closed and schools will follow for at least two weeks for the city centre and some suburbs, with citizens advised not to make unnecessary journeys.Rev Monteith said he is now uncertain about when he canto Enniskillen to visit his parents, or when Leicester Cathedral can reopen.It#s quite sombre here, people are quite stunned, he told the Belfast .The city is quieter today but clearly not everyone has got the message so it#s not quite back to how it was in March or April.He noted how coronavirus death figures in Leicester during the worst parts of the pandemic were lower than expected, adding: Hospitals were pretty much managing to keep on top of things so this suddenly coming into the public arena has really surprised people.Places of worship in England were allowed to open for private prayer earlier this month, with full worship supposed to follow on July . In a very multicultural city like Leicester, that includes mosques, temples, churches and synagogues, he said. Private prayer has worked for some traditions, but in mosques you#re supposed to pray in public.This weekend many faith communities, including the Christian community, would have been able to have a much more normal sense of worship.The cathedral is now closed until further notice, and funerals will again have to be held outside with limited numbers.It sits at the burial site of Richard III, and just this week a large group of tourists had been welcomed inside. This was the first timethat any of us have been in a room with  or more people and there was a real delight and joy about it evenyou couldn#t shake hands or hug, Rev Monteith said.Initially lockdown was a big shock for us. We#ve been doing online weekly services and sometimes we get very signicant numbers of people, far more than would ever come to church. But there#s something about physical presence which is still important even though online offers new possibilities.Somehow we#re going to have to work with both of these realities moving forward.Offering hope to those dreading the latest restrictions, he said: I think I#ve noticed that this whole process has affected people very dferently. Some have found the space and the clear air to have been a delight, while other people have struggled incredibly.But the human spirit is incredibly resilient and hope has not died at all. If anything in Leicester we#ve learned over the years that hope is a gt that comes from community.That#s been my experience over the years,I find myself locked away in a dark place, often the way to get out of it is to break out and reach out.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to spend billions on infrastructure projects, Rev Monteith said those in need must be included.A lot of the people who are being tested positive in Leicester come from BAME backgrounds, and people living in poverty and working in very low paid jobs.We#ve seen a way in which we as a society have revalued care workers who are also not paid very much. I suppose moving forward, in thinking about the type of society we want to try and create, I think church and faith leaders are up for playing their part in creating a much more equitable society.On Tuesday Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester.The Health Secretary said that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus. He added that the decision to shut the city#s schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.

If they are all table service, that should alleviate any problems.It#s really important that government gives us a date. Regrettably, I do think this virus, and therefore social distancing, will be here for a very long time. We need government to help those businesses which just physically cannot reopen.Speaking on the Ulster Business Podcast, Janice Gault, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said while everyone is looking forward to coming back, there is a little bit of nervousness around it.We have discovered that people miss the type of product we provide, she said.But many spots, even those which are technically able to open their doors to serve food, will not open this weekend.The days of the shoulder-to-shoulder pub and back-to-back restaurant will not be with us for a while, Mr Neill says.There will be a responsibility on customers, businesses and staff to do everything to stop the spread of this virus.Mr Rana, whose company owns hotels such as The Crowne Plaza and Ibis in Belfast, said while the core of hotels won#t have changed, customers will start noticing dferences.Hotels are about hospitality ... the fundamentals won#t change. There will be more distance between yourself and fellow diners, but the real work is behind the scenes, he said. In our four star hotels, breakfast will be largely served. The buffet is a touch point we are trying to avoid.In the mid-market and budget hotels there will be a range of #to go# options, just presented in a dferent manner.Ms Gault says while businesses are now keen to bring staff back to work, getting through to March next year is going to be a challenge.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPPSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulationsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hospital and care home visits to resumeNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in yearParades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said it also came at the “worst possible time” given many victims were just about to go into isolation due to the coronavirus emergency.“The message of that was appalling,” she told MPs.Ms Peake noted that the first paragraph of the two-page Government statement focused on the need to protect veterans.“So we were waiting for Stormont House , we felt there was an agreement among the British and Irish governments and the Assembly, we were waiting for an action for that,” she said.“We had no warning and, all of a sudden, in the middle of Covid, a two-page statement came out that really was a demarcation away, with absolutely no warning, at a time when victims and survivors were most vulnerable.“The first paragraph was around the need to protect veterans and then moved on to victims and survivors.“As of last week, we have had one call with the Secretary of State , we’ve had nothing since. We have asked for meetings with the NIOofficials, we’ve had two, which we have asked for, and we were told there’s going to be extensive consultation, we haven’t seen that.“We were told that there would be papers, they haven’t come, and I understand maybe they won’t come.“So it’s really a very, very dficult position for victims and survivors to be in and I really can’t emphasise enough it really feeds mistrust, it feeds a sense that we don’t matter, and that this simply is about veterans and is not about addressing the needs of victims and survivors, and that is grossly unfair.“It’s very unfair to victims and survivors to do that.”Member of the South East Fermanagh Foundationvictims’ group also gave evidence to the committee on Wednesday.Seff has four outreach bases across Northern Ireland and also operates a service in London for the benefit of victims and survivors in Great Britain.Director of Services Kenny Donaldson said the Stormont House proposals were “unacceptable and unworkable”.Mr Donaldson insisted it should be the PSNI’s role to investigate legacy crimes, rather than bringing in officers from where in the UK.He also told MPs the Irish government needed to fully participate in the process and disclose relevant information.The campaigner said any new legacy mechanisms should be founded on the principle that there was never any justication for the use of criminal violence for political objectives.“Over the - period there should have an acknowledgement that criminal violence was wrong and wholly unjustied, that didn’t happen but a quarter of a century later it must now happen, otherwise whatever we seek to achieve on legacy will continue to be built on sand,” he said.“There is a need to re-calibrate society now”.He added: “The Republic of Ireland State sought to portray itself as an onlooker to the problems of Northern Ireland, this is not accurate and there must be a sea change within that attitude, we seek a dferent level of commitment on these issues from the new government recently elected.“There needs to be a much closer collaboration between the ious jurisdictional governments on these issues, no innocent victim or survivor should be left behind.“We believe that we have submitted alternative proposals around an investigative body being housed within the PSNI which are workable, fair, affordable and crucially can deliver outcomes for victims and survivors and we ask for this committee’s detailed consideration of those proposals and moreover, the UK Government’s”.PAMost ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPPSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulationsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hospital and care home visits to resumeNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in year#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were putting the bears out for three weeks before someone suggested raising funds, which of course we did.Marie Curie is a cause so many people identy with and they have an office close to our house. That#s how we chose them and we are over the moon with the amount we raised.I had initially hoped that we would collect somewhere in the region of £, or £,, so to raise over £, has been amazing.While being able to make such a generous donation to Marie Curie was an unexpected outcome, receiving a coveted Harrods bear in the post was another.My we has about  Harrods bears in her collection, Morris explained.I gave her a bear every Christmas before I retired and was travelling back and forward to London. Of course, these were part of our daily display.I never could have imagined anyone from Harrods would see our story in the Belfast , let alone send this year#s bear as a thank-you to us.It was such a generous gesture and a big surprise when the bear arrived in the post with a lovely note from Harrods.I wrote back updating them on the final tally collected for Marie Curie and to say a big thank-you.The bear, which is called Nicolas, is a very welcome addition to the collection. It will be a constant reminder of this very unusual time we have found ourselves in.

The move was backed by the DUP, Sinn Fein and the SDLP, while the UUP, Alliance, Greens and People Before Profit gave their support to an amendment from TUV leader Jim Allister.The North Antrim MLA proposed that an independent body be given the role of setting future allowances, subject to Assembly Commission guidance.However, Mr Allister#s proposal was rejected by a vote of  to , with one abstention.He said he feared that those behind the proposal had failed to learn from previous abuses of the expenses system.Those who tabled the motion must have short memories. I do not think that the public have, added the TUV leader. The public well remember that when the system that is proposed in the motion was in operation - namely, that MLAs controlled, through the commission, their own expenses - it was abused and the product was scandal.Alan McQuillan was part of the  in an independent review which previously determined the salaries, expenses and pensions paid to MLAs.He said: This decision takes them back  years. They will be the only legislative body in the UK or Ireland doing this.My fear is that, give it two or three years and we will find ourselves in the original situation, causing serious damage to the reputation of the Assembly.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who put forward the allowances proposal, said the current rules failed to recognise economic realities facing MLAs.The motion will enable the Assembly Commission to ensure that members can legitimately purchase basic items to help them to deliver services to our constituents, that an MLA#s contact details can be promoted on the constituency office, and, most notably, to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff who work in our offices are fair and reasonable, he added.Sinn Fein#s John O#Dowd argued that the TUV amendment would cause further delays to expenses reforms.Mr O#Dowd said: Go back to your staff in your constituency offices, or some of your staff may be sitting in offices in this building.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSpeeding is a major cause of accidents resulting in deaths.Adrian RutherfordTwitterEmailJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Almost , incidents were recorded on the region#s roads in  - equivalent to  every day on average.In one case a driver was caught at mph, nearly double the road#s mph limit.The worst hotspot was the Frosses Crankill Road in Co Antrim, where , offences were recorded.A senior PSNI officer said speeding was still the single biggest killer on our roads.Inspector Rosie Leech said: Far too many people continue to take unacceptable risks on our roads whether speeding, not paying attention, driving after drinking, taking drugs or not wearing seatbelts.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNew figures released by the Northern Ireland Road Safety Partnershipshow that:, speeding detections were made in . This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

His coffin was draped in the Tricolour.Thousands of mourners congregated on each side of the Andersonstown Road as the cortege left the family home at Owenragh Park at around .am for the short journey to the church.Men and women dressed in black trousers, white shirts and black ties formed a guard of honour, while black flags hung from the windows of houses along the street, and two kilted pipers played airs that included The Minstrel Boy, Sean South of Garryowen, A Nation Once Again and On Raglan Road.In accordance with coronavirus regulations, about  people were permitted to walk behind the hearse, including Mr Storey#s partner Teresa, children, grandchildren and other family members. Also among them were Sinn Fein presidents past and present Gerry Adams and Mary Lou McDonald, the party#s northern leader and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill and members of her late predecessor

Bobby Storey takes place in Andersonstown, west Belfast on June th  There was a low-profile but visible police presence, and scores of volunteer Sinn Fein stewards in place to manage the large crowd on a cold, grey morning, with rain falling only as the funeral procession made its way to Milltown Cemetery, where Mr Adams delivered a eulogy.I don#t know anyone who knew him who didn#t like him. Except for MI, MI, the old RUC, the British Army, and prison governors, said Mr Adams.How could you not like him  He was smart, well read, funny, caring, always ready to listen - always willing to help - always prepared to give freely of his time and his great positive energy.Earlier, a security check of the area surrounding the church had been conducted.The service was led by Fr Gary Donegan at the request of the Storey family.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFr Gary Donegan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFr Gary DoneganFr Donegan, director of the Passionist Peace and Reconciliation Office in north Belfast, knew Mr Storey for two decades from his time as rector of Holy Cross Church in Ardoyne.Mourners were told that Mr Storey was a -hour-a day-activist and leader who led from the front all his le.In his homily, Fr Donegan quoted from a tweet written by Sinn Fein veteran Gerry Kelly shortly after Mr Storey died, in which the MLA wrote: Bobby ran the marathon of le at a sprint, in conflict and in peace... his legacy will drive us all forward.Fr Donegan - who earlier this week hit out at keyboard warriors criticising him for taking on the former IRA leader#s funeral - said: Over these days, many comments and eulogies have and will be written about Bobby. This is dferent.He told the congregation that Mr Storey was raised during a time when communities were under threat and the Army were constantly patrolling the streets... ultimately the family were intimidated from their home and spent several days sheltering in Girdwood Army Barracks.Mr Storey would later rise in the republican ranks, becoming the IRA#s director of intelligence and the northern chairman of Sinn Fein. He spent many years in jail for ious offences, played a key role in the mass IRA breakout from the Maze Prison in  and was widely regarded as one of the most feared and formidable members of the republican organisation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe late Bobby StoreyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe late Bobby StoreyHe is also credited with having played a prominent role in the peace process.Fr Donegan said that, having worked as a confessor for the past  years, he thanks God for not being confined to the limitations of human compassion and mercy.Often the biggest task of a confessor is to convince people to follow God#s example and to forgive themselves, he told the congregation.Reflecting on Mr Storey#s le, Fr Donegan described him as a devoted partner to Teresa with a gt of humour extended to all he met.The priest recalled how Mr Storey#s -year relationship with Teresa began to develop from the time of Bobby#s first parole in  and how his partner spoke of Bobby the family man and the great love he had for sister Geraldine and brothers Seamus and Brian.She told us of the great mutual love shared between Bobby and her sons Emmett, Fergal and Sean, he continued.The priest added that Bobby Storey will be fondly remembered by those who knew him.Ironically, his funeral may be remembered more by those who did not.

Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship.

Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration. CASE STUDY QUEEN’S HOTEL Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak. googletag.cmd.push The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth. Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.  THERE FOR YOU: Queen’s Hotel lit up for NHS andpreparing food in the kitchen Megan put a post on the Portsmouth Coronavirus Support Group on Facebook asking members to support her idea and it has since taken off with donations pouring in from iniduals and businesses. googletag.cmd.push She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing. “I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel. “I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded. “The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.” Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes. The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.”  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two pound, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.” Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.” CASE STUDY HIGHLAND AUTO CAMPERS When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill. So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would. But then came the problem of where to put them. The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’” “I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.” Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost. While they’d normally charge pound a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just pound each a week. Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked. “But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.  TEAMING UP: Highland Auto Campers owner Mark Jarratt with girlfriend Alicia “Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus. “They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site. They wanted to rent three of our vans to do this. “We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help. “It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing. “Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up. “The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.” Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!” The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.” CASE STUDY SHNUGGLE Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business. Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, airflow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations. But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown. Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives. Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield. Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world. “A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’. “We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.  DREAM TEAM: The Shnuggle staff “We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised pound, in the end. “We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.” Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running. Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS. “It was worth shy of poundm and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.” So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an

McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is

Borough Council looks set to agree to waive the licence fee for on street cafes.By The NewsroomWednesday, st July , : pm\"\"Portadown Town Centre.The decision was agreed upon at a meeting of Council’s COVID- working group, held behind closed doors on Tuesday evening, the Local DemocracyReporting Service understands.The decision will ensure that cafes who register for and are granted an on-street licence between now and December  will have until October ,  to trade and seat their customers at tables on streets, without paying a fee to Council.The working group also agreed to suspend parking charges for Council owned, paid for, car parks within the Borough until st August and then again for the month of the December .While members of the group agreed that this is the positive way forward, it was also noted that parking attendantswill still be patrolling these areas and those who abandon cars across two or more parking bays can still expect to be punished.While up to  people can now gather at cemeteries across the Borough, it is understood a decision was reached last night for Council to write to the Executive to request clarication on the possibility of increasing that number further.While these decision were agreed upon last night, they will not be made official until they are ratied at a meeting of the full Council later this month, though that process is expected to be little more than a formality.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\"
