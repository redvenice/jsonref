The rest of the things were just be careful.\u0027But they were very emphatic about not giving any information to the press or talking to them, because it just encourages them more. So none the less, that\u0027s what I tried to do.\u0027Despite these conversations however, allegations later surfaced that he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday showed the 73-year-old former lighting director arriving at an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner.‘It was presented to me as a chance to change my image because for the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,’ he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.‘They would take pictures of me with my hand on a beer, taking the bins out, buying a toilet and making a big deal of it and it all made me look negative.‘I didn’t do it for money, I did it to change my image. For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake but it’s hard to take it back but again it was to improve my look, I had been seen negatively for an entire year.’   On Prince Charles…\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027: Thomas Markle\u0027s regret at not giving Meghan away as he says he was jealous but thankful \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles stepped in          Prince Charles took Meghan Markle to the altar in the absence of her father and symbolically had entered St George\u0027s Chapel alone Mr Markle thanked Prince Charles for stepping in on the big day and giving his daughter away, but added that he was \u0027jealous\u0027 as he watched from the US.Calling the prince \u0027handsome\u0027, he said he could not think of anyone better to walk his daughter down the aisle in his absence.Mr Markle told Good Morning Britain: \u0027It might have been a treat for him as well because he has never had a daughter.\u0027I was honoured. I can’t think of a better replacement then Mr Charles. He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me but thank God he was there.\u0027He said he still had not met Prince Charles or spoken to him on the phone but that he looked forward to \u0027thanking him\u0027 when he eventually met the royal face to face.Mr Markle\u0027s absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute that his name was still in the Order of Service on the day.He said: \u0027She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her. I was very proud and I couldn\u0027t see a better moment in my life.

Right now they\u0027ve earnt the right to go away on a honeymoon.\u0027Going forward I would certainly love to meet the Queen. I\u0027ve had respect for that woman since I was a child.\u0027I think she\u0027s one of the most incredible women in the world and I\u0027d love to meet her.He said that Harry and Meghan offered to come and visit him after the wedding, but he told them it was \u0027a bad idea as the press would eat them alive\u0027.Speaking about his health and travelling abroad in the future, he added: \u0027I\u0027m on the mend and I\u0027m feeling much better. Doctors are making me lose weight and take care of myself so I\u0027ll be ready to go.\u0027  On becoming a grandfather…\u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time\u0027: Thomas Markle talks grandchildren as he says a child \u0027will be in the making soon\u0027 for Harry and MeghanMr Markle said that he expects his daughter and Harry will want to try for children soon.He told the programme: ‘She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.’Mr Markle said: ‘As long as they\u0027re happy and they have a great life and have some beautiful children and do good things in the world, I can\u0027t ask for more.’  On pulling out of the royal wedding…Meghan\u0027s father reveals she cried when he told her he couldn\u0027t make royal wedding because of a heart attack as he says both she and Harry told him to \u0027take care\u0027          Mr Markle watched the moment the couple married from a sofa in a Californian B\u0026ampB, he revealed todayThomas Markle Snr choked back tears as he reflected on the royal wedding and revealed how he had planned to attend the big day until he was forced to pull out at the eleventh hour.He broke the news to Meghan about his absence in an emotional phone call just days before she was due to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel.He said: ‘They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day. We’ve always had a good relationship around our daughter and between the two of us.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

She didn’t appear to have any other medical or psychiatric illness … She just did not appear to be a psychiatrically troubled person at all. ‘She had children, she had a normal family – and so I remember, when the priest said to me: “Dr Gallagher, that’s what I thought, but we wanted to make sure that we checked her out medically,” I said, “Well, Father, you know I’m pretty sceptical.” And he said, “That’s the type of person we wanted.”‘So then he continued to send me things he and his colleague, who was an ex-Marine, who had also become a prominent exorcist … I actually became very good friends with them. They’re both deceased now, but I miss them terribly.’Before that first case – and his relationship with exorcists and the demonic world – he says he was unaware of the intricacies of possession and oppression.He grew up a devout Catholic, one of five children born to an Irish-American lawyer and his homemaker wife. Dr Gallagher attended weekly Mass with his family and studied at renowned Catholic high school Regis in New York City before being accepted to Princeton.‘I didn’t know what I wanted to be,’ he says. ‘I probably wanted to become a lawyer, a professor or something. I did like helping people, you know – so when I was at Princeton I had a number of roommates who were pre-med, and I just got interested, intrigued by the idea of becoming a doctor. And I’ve also read a lot in my life, so I got interested in psychoanalytic ideas, and it just kind of dawned on me that helping people, as well as becoming a professor, would be interesting if I did it as a professor of psychiatry. So that’s what I decided to do.’He laughs: ‘I’m the black sheep who became a psychiatrist in an Irish Catholic family.’Following Princeton, he played semi-professional basketball in France and taught English at a French high school. Then he trained as a resident in psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, and he is currently on the faculty at New York Medical College and Columbia University Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research.  It was as his career progressed, however, that his acquaintance with the world of evil spirits intensified. He says he’s seen about four cases a year, though he’s heard of hundreds more, especially at meetings of the Europe-based International Association of Exorcists.He mentions the case of another US housewife, though he does not specify her location. This woman – he gives her the pseudonym of Catherine - ‘as a teenager had dabbled in satanic rituals, and she had kind of promised herself, in some fairly foolish way, to evil spirits,’ he says. ‘She did a few grisly things, which I’m not going to go into, but she also, with a couple of friends, they did minor satanic rituals and she became possessed.            Ferrer Bassa (1290-1346) painted this work showing St Bernard of Clairvaux exorcising someone possessed the Catholic Church has a strict set of criteria for determining demonic possession - which can afflict any culture, age, race or religion, Dr Gallagher says          Dr Gallagher, pictured during his days at Princeton, where he was a Classics major before he pursued a career in psychiatry‘She was certainly violent when the evil spirit took over, and she had a variety of signs of possession. It took multiple, multiple people to hold her down during exorcism.’He adds: ‘She had a very odd symptom, which is similar to a case in the gospels, where she selectively couldn’t hear certain things … If you said to her: “Catherine, did you go to the store today?” Shey’d say “yes.” “What’d you buy?” “Meat and potatoes.” If you said, “Catherine, did you go to church today?” She would say, “What?” “Catherine, did you go to church or did you pray today?” “Did I what?”‘Her sense of hearing was blocked. So we had the bright idea – I was with a fellow psychiatrist, we were assessing her – and we had the bright idea, why don’t we write it on a piece of paper?‘So we wrote it on a piece of paper: What did you do this morning? And she said, “Well, I drove the car to the gas station, I had to fill up the gas tank.” “Catherine, did you pray today? Did you go to church?” and hold it up on a piece of paper.‘Do you know what she said to me? She said, “Dr Gallagher, why are you doing this?” I said, “What do you mean?” “Why are you showing me a blank piece of paper?”’‘Now the obvious motive there was to prevent her from being able to talk about anything spiritual, get the help that she needed, get the solace and spiritual support she needed.’The evil spirits take hold of people, he says, because they truly hate God and humans.‘We have the ability to love and turn to God they don’t. They made their choices, and they hate the image of God in human beings,’ he says. ‘They truly seem to hate human beings. I mean, not only do they want to destroy us spiritually, alienate us from God, but they seem to take almost a sadistic pleasure in destroying us as creatures who can still turn to God, to their enemy, creatures who can also still love, which they don’t seem capable of anymore. They’ve rejected the whole idea of goodness and love in a kind of perverted way.’Gay Christian rock star backed by Archbishop of Canterbury...Exorcism 101! Vatican holds training course for priests to...The Pope says the Devil is a \u0027loser\u0027... but can still seduce...Share this articleHe says the demons exhibit extraordinary powers such as personal knowledge and near clairvoyance. On one occasion, a demon told him how his mother had died – ovarian cancer. That evil spirit also knew ‘how 15 other people’s parents died, too. It wasn\u0027t just me.’On another occasion, a demon told him exactly what a priest was wearing though the clergyman was nowhere near Dr Gallagher and the possessed person speaking. In a different case, Gallagher was also personally addressed.‘I had a demon say to me: “How’s that book going? It won’t do any good” … that’s when I was first thinking of writing a book. So I’ve had demons come and they’ve said they hate me, but again, I think they hate all Christians … they certainly put more of their energy in saying how they hate the exorcist. That’s their real target, not me.He tells another story of a woman in her 30s, a member of a Satanist cult who was thinking about leaving – which is when the evil spirits took over her body.This woman ‘was in the back of a car once, and I was with the exorcist, and she went into a trance,’ he says. ‘She was unequivocally possessed … and I heard her in the back seat of the car.‘She came out with some vile stuff – “Leave her alone you f*****g priest”, that sort of thing, and this went on for about five minutes. Then she came out she had no remembrance of it at all.’                            I understand believing in evil spirits is not a very comforting belief ... when you\u0027ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that                         He continues: ‘I never went to her exorcisms, because I was busy … but the priest would invite me to come to the exorcism. It wasn’t around here. And I’m on the telephone line, this is a landline, with the priest at the time, and he says, “You know, Rich, can you make this exorcism session?” And then, during that phone conversation – and this woman was hundreds of miles away … that same voice came in on the phone and it said “Leave her alone, leave her alone, you f*****g priest. She’s ours, she’s not yours.” And I did hear that. That was creepy.’He says that, despite his work and beliefs regarding demons and possession, he has ‘never felt particularly harassed or discriminated against, because Americans tend to be kind of a tolerant, pluralistic people.‘In the larger society, it’s not a fringe belief,’ he says. ‘This is actually a mainstream belief. Opinion polls show that probably about 60 percent and upwards – probably about 70 percent of America – believe in the devil, and the majority of Americans … believe in evil spirits and demons have some ability to directly attack human beings.‘People will sometimes say to me, “How do you feel about talking about a fringe belief?” I say, “It’s not a fringe belief. I’m more mainstream than skeptics. The other thing about skeptics is, the extreme skeptics, they’ve never seen a case.‘They come up with all kinds of cockamamie theories … they say, “Well, you know, this person heard Latin babbled as a kid.” But it’s kind of absurd.

Having said that – and there’s plenty of alternate theories I don’t think that those theories usually hold water – and when you’ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that.’And, despite having witnessed evil and his interactions with demons, he says he’s not particularly worried that they’ll come after the psychiatrist himself he’s bolstered by his faith and the faith of others.‘I have a lot of people praying for me,’ he says.‘I’m not seeing the devil everywhere,’ he explains, adding: ‘I always tell people it’s an equal mistake to see the devil everywhere as to deny the devil exists.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/11/4D677C1D00000578-5857921-image-m-47_1529405960959.jpg","title":"England fans pack pubs Britain Group G fixture against Tunisia","story":"One over-excited England fan was filmed on the bonnet of a car as it tried to push its way through the crowds in Plymouth on Monday evening before the vehicle braked and threw him off    Another video shows the fan holding an arm aloft as he jumps on the bonnet of the car      A number of jubilant supporters were filmed trying to clamber onto the bonnet of a car as it tried to push its way through the crowds there on Monday evening          The fan clings on to the windscreen of the car as it speeds off from the crowd, before it breaks suddenly  With one fan - dressed in a red England shirt - clinging onto the bonnet, the car is seen speeding up then braking suddenly, throwing the man off and into the middle of the street\u0027I was just relieved to see the man get to back his feet so quickly.\u0027My heart really was in my mouth for a few seconds, as his head could so easily have smashed into the road.\u0027I really don\u0027t know what the driver was thinking.

She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/13/4D68031400000578-5859189-image-a-43_1529410507973.jpg","title":"North Korean leader Kim Jong make two day visit Beijing","story":"    Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan, right, greeted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with his wife Ri Sol-Ju, left,  at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday          Footage run by China\u0027s CCTV shows President Xi and Kim shaking hands during a welcome reception in Beijing           President Xi offered high praise to Kim on Tuesday, lauding the \u0027positive\u0027 outcome of his historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump and promising unwavering friendship  Kim Jong-un has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with China\u0027s President Xi Jinping where he is likely to reveal details of his goundbreaking meeting with Donald Trump (Kim\u0027s car pictured)          Security was tight on Tuesday morning as a motorcade including sedans, minibuses, motorcycles and a stretch limo with a golden emblem was seen leaving Beijing\u0027s airport          Kim\u0027s previous journey to Beijing was made using an armoured train that was also used by his father, but on Tuesday he arrived by plane and was taken to meet Xi in a motorcade          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make a two-day visit to Beijing starting Tuesday following his groundbreaking summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore last weekXi told Kim that he was very happy to see  the important consensus reached on denuclearisation and setting up a lasting peace mechanism, Chinese state TV said.\u0027No matter the changes in the international and regional situation, China\u0027s party and government\u0027s resolute position on being dedicated to consolidating and developing Sino-North Korea relations will not change,\u0027 the report cited Xi as saying.\u0027The Chinese people\u0027s friendship for the North Korean people will not change, and China\u0027s support for socialist North Korea will not change,\u0027 Xi added.Brothers in arms: Trump keeps his promise to Kim Jong Un and...Kim Jong-un gets thumbs-up from 1 in 5 Republicans – making...Share this articleKim told Xi he hoped to work with China and other parties to push the peace process forward, Chinese state television said.While not billed as a state visit, China gave Kim most of the trappings, including a welcome ceremony with honour guard in Beijing\u0027s Great Hall of the People.Xi greeted Kim warmly as the two men were accompanied by their wives.Xi said he was pleased to see North Korea\u0027s decision to promote economic reforms, adding that China\u0027s own reform and opening up process had meant the Chinese people\u0027s eyes had been open to the world. North Korean state media had not mentioned Kim\u0027s visit by early evening.In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days.

But some say the ship wasn\u0027t the Titanic - rather, its sister ship, Olympic - and it was all part of an insurance scamCaptain L M Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service, suggested in 2003 that what the Titanic hit was not an iceberg but low-lying pack ice.He based his theory on his own experience of ice navigation and conflicting witness statements given at the inquiry into the Titanic disaster that seemed to suggest crew members were tricked by optical illusions which pack ice has been known to cause.In 2004, Ohio State University engineer Robert Essenhigh suggested that a coal fire may have been to blame for the disaster.He claimed that a pile of stored coal had begun to smoulder and desperate engineers threw it into the furnaces, accelerating the ship to unsafe speeds in the iceberg-infested waters.One of the most controversial theories about the Titanic is that it never sank at all.Robin Gardiner suggests that before its maiden voyage, the ship had in fact been switched with its sister ship Olympic, in an elaborate insurance scam.A year before the launch of the Titanic, the Olympic had been involved in a collision with the HMS Hawke near Southampton.Gardiner suggests that the White Star Line was not insured for the cost of fixing the boat so, in order to save the company from a loss, it was disguised as the Titanic and deliberately sunk to make a claim on that boat\u0027s insurance.Thus, Gardiner believes the Titanic went on to spend 25 years in service as the Olympic.Even more fantastic is the urban legend that the Titanic was cursed by the mummy of the Priestess of Amen-Ra, who lived in 1050BC.The story goes that after the mummy had been passed around like a hot potato, giving bad luck to whoever had it in their possession, a journalist, William Thomas Stead, bought it and took it with him as he travelled to America on the Titanic.According to the legend, he arranged for the mummy to be hidden under the body of his car, for fear that the Titanic\u0027s crew would refuse to take it aboard.He reportedly revealed to other passengers the presence of the mummy the night before the tragedy.

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/13/4D68031400000578-5859189-image-a-43_1529410507973.jpg","title":"North Korean leader Kim Jong make two day visit Beijing","story":"    Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan, right, greeted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with his wife Ri Sol-Ju, left,  at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday          Footage run by China\u0027s CCTV shows President Xi and Kim shaking hands during a welcome reception in Beijing           President Xi offered high praise to Kim on Tuesday, lauding the \u0027positive\u0027 outcome of his historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump and promising unwavering friendship  Kim Jong-un has arrived in Beijing for a meeting with China\u0027s President Xi Jinping where he is likely to reveal details of his goundbreaking meeting with Donald Trump (Kim\u0027s car pictured)          Security was tight on Tuesday morning as a motorcade including sedans, minibuses, motorcycles and a stretch limo with a golden emblem was seen leaving Beijing\u0027s airport          Kim\u0027s previous journey to Beijing was made using an armoured train that was also used by his father, but on Tuesday he arrived by plane and was taken to meet Xi in a motorcade          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make a two-day visit to Beijing starting Tuesday following his groundbreaking summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore last weekXi told Kim that he was very happy to see  the important consensus reached on denuclearisation and setting up a lasting peace mechanism, Chinese state TV said.\u0027No matter the changes in the international and regional situation, China\u0027s party and government\u0027s resolute position on being dedicated to consolidating and developing Sino-North Korea relations will not change,\u0027 the report cited Xi as saying.\u0027The Chinese people\u0027s friendship for the North Korean people will not change, and China\u0027s support for socialist North Korea will not change,\u0027 Xi added.Brothers in arms: Trump keeps his promise to Kim Jong Un and...Kim Jong-un gets thumbs-up from 1 in 5 Republicans – making...Share this articleKim told Xi he hoped to work with China and other parties to push the peace process forward, Chinese state television said.While not billed as a state visit, China gave Kim most of the trappings, including a welcome ceremony with honour guard in Beijing\u0027s Great Hall of the People.Xi greeted Kim warmly as the two men were accompanied by their wives.Xi said he was pleased to see North Korea\u0027s decision to promote economic reforms, adding that China\u0027s own reform and opening up process had meant the Chinese people\u0027s eyes had been open to the world. North Korean state media had not mentioned Kim\u0027s visit by early evening.In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days.

Sarah Daniels travelled on the Titanic in first class with businessman Hudson Allison, his wife Bessie, their two children, Lorraine and Trevor and nursemaid Alice Cleaver. The family died in the disaster except for baby Trevor who survived along with Ms Daniels. (Above, a scene from the 1997 film, Titanic)          An artist\u0027s illustration of the disaster. But some say the ship wasn\u0027t the Titanic - rather, its sister ship, Olympic - and it was all part of an insurance scamCaptain L M Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service, suggested in 2003 that what the Titanic hit was not an iceberg but low-lying pack ice.He based his theory on his own experience of ice navigation and conflicting witness statements given at the inquiry into the Titanic disaster that seemed to suggest crew members were tricked by optical illusions which pack ice has been known to cause.In 2004, Ohio State University engineer Robert Essenhigh suggested that a coal fire may have been to blame for the disaster.He claimed that a pile of stored coal had begun to smoulder and desperate engineers threw it into the furnaces, accelerating the ship to unsafe speeds in the iceberg-infested waters.One of the most controversial theories about the Titanic is that it never sank at all.Robin Gardiner suggests that before its maiden voyage, the ship had in fact been switched with its sister ship Olympic, in an elaborate insurance scam.A year before the launch of the Titanic, the Olympic had been involved in a collision with the HMS Hawke near Southampton.Gardiner suggests that the White Star Line was not insured for the cost of fixing the boat so, in order to save the company from a loss, it was disguised as the Titanic and deliberately sunk to make a claim on that boat\u0027s insurance.Thus, Gardiner believes the Titanic went on to spend 25 years in service as the Olympic.Even more fantastic is the urban legend that the Titanic was cursed by the mummy of the Priestess of Amen-Ra, who lived in 1050BC.The story goes that after the mummy had been passed around like a hot potato, giving bad luck to whoever had it in their possession, a journalist, William Thomas Stead, bought it and took it with him as he travelled to America on the Titanic.According to the legend, he arranged for the mummy to be hidden under the body of his car, for fear that the Titanic\u0027s crew would refuse to take it aboard.He reportedly revealed to other passengers the presence of the mummy the night before the tragedy.

Is it a French rococo whatnot? A Renaissance objet d’art? These are the kinds of European treasures this museum is famous for. But no. The beaten gold mask that holds you enthralled in this gorgeous exhibition was made in the Ashanti empire in west Africa in the 18th or 19th century. It is a masterpiece of African art that has lain tucked away in the abundance of the Wallace Collection since Victorian times.When the British empire was at war with the gold-rich Ashanti empire in 1873-74, this astonishing object was looted from the royal palace in Kumasi. It ended up in the hands of the royal jeweller Garrard and Co, which sold it to the wealthy and omnivorous collector Richard Wallace.This exhibition about Wallace – who was born 200 years ago, in 1818 – makes it clear what an atypical Victorian he was. Born illegitimate in London, he was taken to Paris to be educated by the family of his mother’s lover, the expatriate fourth Marquess of Hertford. He became the marquess’s private secretary and, in 1870, inherited his vast fortune. He was, almost certainly, Hertford’s son. The Wallace Collection, as it is called today, was started in Paris by the Marquess of Hertford, but it was Wallace who brought it to London and built the house that still holds it. He indulged his passions as a collector in the auction rooms of Victorian London, bidding against his rivals, the Rothschilds, for treasures from all over the world. This exhibition picks out some of his most precious finds to create a sumptuous survey of art and opulence, a portrait of the art collector as dreamer.This a great way to inaugurate the Wallace’s new underground exhibition space, an atmospheric lair that includes the Victorian coal vaults. Their arches now hold Wallace’s treasured Renaissance daggers and jewels. The dagger of Henri IV of France, made in about 1599, is lavishly inlaid with mother of pearl, yet Wallace bought it for sentimental reasons: Henry IV was a champion of religious tolerance who ended the wars of religion in France and was assassinated for his courage. In Paris, you can still find the Wallace fountains, free water points for the poor in a neo-Renaissance style that he put up and paid for after living in Paris during its siege and the commune in 1870-71.Wallace was a good European with a great eye for treasures. His boxwood statuette of Hercules, carved by Francesco Pomarano in about 1520, is a throbbingly homoerotic masterpiece of club-wielding muscle. A maiolica plate with a crowd of naked female bathers painted on it in 1525 is equally lusty. There was nothing puritanical about this Victorian collector who gleefully amassed things that once belonged to European rulers. The Horn of Saint Hubert, a coveted medieval relic with rich carvings done in the 15th century, was once the property of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Yet, that’s nothing. In researching this show, the curators established that two ornate Chinese cups in the collection were used by the Qianlong emperor in the 18th century in a ritual ceremony to ensure the stability of China.It didn’t work. Wallace bought the cups at a Paris auction in 1872. They had been looted from the Summer Palace when it was destroyed by Britain in 1860 in the second opium war.Wallace was a buccaneer collector in an age of global plunder and capitalist rapacity. The result is one of the world’s finest public art collections, a treasury we all share. In picking out some of its lesser-known wonders in a sharp, seductive light, this lovely exhibition sends you into the rest of the gallery to explore its strangeness and beauty with new eyes.  • Sir Richard Wallace: The Collector is at the Wallace Collection, London, from 20 June until 6 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39c2b77680c9105a923b0bb6c853b8eccc60d5b/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=93d712a7641d60c8d91120fe806a981f 1320w","title":"brexit fairy tales public spending austerity","story":"Theresa May has spent the weekend trying to convince people that there is such a thing as a “Brexit idend” with the dead-eyed look of a minimum-wage sales assistant trying to get you to sign up for the extended warranty. It’s obvious nonsense even she doesn’t believe in, but her job depends on going through the motions, so go through them she will.May’s newly announced NHS spending promises come with the vaguest funding plans possible. She announced yesterday that “as a country taxpayers will need to contribute a bit more, but we will do that in a fair and balanced way,” which could mean almost anything. Mostly, though, she is relying on the notion that money we used to send to the EU will be freed up for other things. This claim has been comprehensively, utterly debunked ever since it first appeared on the side of Boris Johnson’s infamous bus. The Office for Budget Responsibility and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have both pointed out, again, that it won’t happen and has no relationship to reality. It’s a lie, and at this stage it’s not even a very good one.We should not fall into a false binary trap, though. The absence of the mythical idend does not mean we will not be able to fund the NHS.Without the Brexit idend, the other funding options are taxes or deficit spending, and the government can’t deficit spend unless it abandons its fiscal targets. But these targets are not an immutable fact of economic logic. They are policy positions the government made for political reasons. These targets have done immense damage to the real economy of the UK, and will continue to do so while they remain in place. They can be abandoned, and they should be.The argument for austerity is even more threadbare than it was when Cameron and Osborne pulled their con in 2010. As a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund points out, and as heterodox economists have been saying for years, the standard assumptions about the sustainability of government debt are wrong. The UK can deficit spend and issue gilts to invest in the NHS, and the country will not collapse around our ears as a result.During the 2007-08 financial crisis the real economy took a hit, with people losing their jobs and businesses losing revenue. This meant tax revenues decreased and spending on unemployment benefits increased, and so the government budget deficit increased. Very serious and sensible people told us this meant that we had to cut spending to get the deficit under control, on the basis that this would somehow fix the economy.This was a mistake. When the economy goes into a downturn, it is necessary for the government to increase spending and run a deficit. If it does not, as our government did not after the financial crisis, then government policy compounds the problems of the private sector, stifling growth and strangling economic recovery.After Brexit we will also most likely see a downturn in real economic activity. Imports and exports will take a hit, which will lower productivity and raise prices. The extent of this hit depends on where Brexit falls on the hardsoft spectrum, and on the degree of additional border friction, but nobody credible believes it won’t happen at all.This will lower tax revenues and so, just as after the financial crisis, the deficit will rise. However, arguing that this will necessitate a cut in public spending is to accept the logic of austerity. The government can run a deficit after Brexit just as it should have run one after the financial crisis. The people who argue that economic downturns make public services unaffordable were wrong then, and they are wrong now.Those who oppose Brexit will be tempted to play up the potential downsides, but by arguing that Brexit will constrain fiscal policy to such an extent that the government will have no choice but to cut public services, they risk making their warnings into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Such arguments would give an ideologically driven Tory government the cover for further cuts, or could be used to try to argue a Labour government’s policy of increased spending was unaffordable. After years of public sector cuts, we will need to increase spending whether Brexit happens or not. Given that the most likely outcome is that some kind of Brexit will happen, it seems unwise to spend the run-up to it talking about how it’s going to mean we need to cut funding for public services, even for short-term strategic reasons.This is not to say that we should be sanguine about the impact of Brexit. Border friction and inflation will have real effects. The stimulative impact of deficit spending will be absorbed, to a greater or lesser extent, by weakening trade and inflation. We cannot simply say that Brexit difficulties can be fully countered with active fiscal policy and leave it there. But we need to be having the discussion, in a realistic appraisal of what will happen and what we can do about it – not in a simplistic binary world where the only two choices are “all the money we get back from the EU will pay for magical ponies for all” or “Brexit means we have to sack all the nurses”.Let’s try to learn some lessons from the last decade rather than blindly repeating the same mistakes. Making up economic fairytales for partisan advantage won’t do anyone any good.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/366167569435bb78542a6da9e1cfbb5dfe87828f/0_264_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f8df3d91f90605f1dc00d8b2fdd978","title":"is it time for me and other expats to leave the us","story":"Because I have a British passport, I am considered the ‘right’ sort of foreigner. But it feels unethical to help fund a regime that is becoming increasingly totalitarianWhy would anyone choose to live in the US any more? If you are not fleeing desperate circumstances (and Brexit does not yet qualify), why would you willingly make the US your home?I have been asking myself this a lot lately. I was born in London and I have a British passport, but I have been living in New York City for seven years. I love New York. However, the city has a fatal flaw: it is in the US. And the US, you may have noticed, has become terrifyingly totalitarian. It is starting to feel unethical to be an expat here. After all, it does not matter how much you #Resist – there is no getting past the fact that electing to live in the US means paying taxes to Donald Trump’s administration. It means helping to fund a government that is ripping children detained at the border from their parents and placing them in cages. It means being complicit in Trump’s morally bankrupt regime.Of course, wherever in the world you live, your taxes generally help to fund something awful. As a legal resident but non-citizen of the US, however, I am subject to taxation without representation. I cannot attempt to control where my tax dollars go by voting for a particular political candidate. I can, however, choose not to pay US taxes by extricating myself from the country. As an expat, I am in the privileged position of being able to vote with my feet and my finances.I know lots of Britons in the US. We all think of ourselves – and are generally thought of – as “expats”, rather than “migrants” or “immigrants”. But that word is applied only to a select few. Excepting certain intra-European nuances, the rule of thumb seems to be that anyone who possesses a western passport and moves to another country is an expat, never a migrant. This is not just semantics the differences in meaning between “expat” and the more dehumanising “migrant” and “immigrant” are important to parse, because they shine a light on the double standards applied to international migration. Being able to think of yourself as an “expat” is a luxury few people have. It is certainly not a luxury enjoyed by the children being separated from their parents as part of the US’s immigration policy. In a US increasingly hostile to foreigners, those of us who qualify (for now, at least) as the “right” sort of foreigner must start thinking about how ethical it is to passively enjoy our privileged positions.But you know what? Let’s forget Trump for a minute. Because, even if you leave all the ethical considerations aside, the US has long ceased to be a place anyone except the very wealthy or the very desperate would rationally choose to live. There is the country’s inequitable healthcare system, for one thing being poor and sick is basically a death sentence here. Then there is the US’s embarrassing lack of parental leave and its deadly obsession with guns. Why on earth would you choose to live in a country where kids get bulletproof shields for their backpacks as a gift for graduating middle school?I am not packing up and leaving the US yet, mainly because I have not persuaded my American partner to relocate to Brexit Britain. So, this is not my “Goodbye to New York” essay. However, it is a requiem of sorts for the US. There was a time I considered the US to be a land of opportunity. But unless your last name is Trump, the American dream is dead.

So put that up your kundalini and see how it transcends.In truth, the reasons I don’t do yoga are manifold: my living space is so small that any attempt at a pose more ambitious than the tree will inevitably end with me crashing into my child’s toys I have all the self-discipline of a labrador and am therefore unlikely to ever achieve much at home under my own bending steam when given the choice between spending £14 on a post-natal yoga class in London or spending £14 on the ability to actually travel around London on public transport, I will always choose the latter.So it is with a certain unattractive, unforgivable smugness of my own that I read how, in this study, students interviewed within an hour of a yoga class scored highly in an inventory of narcissistic tendencies and described themselves as more enhanced than the average student.Isn’t that just a peach for lazy cynics like myself? Isn’t it just glorious to be told that all that slow-smiling, soft-voiced, slightly bended-knee, chiming, chanting, sesame-oiled and gently lit activity really is the stuff of self-indulgence and big-headedness? Doesn’t it just take the pressure off for a moment to be told that self-improvement and spiritual hunger makes you an insufferable arse?Of course what we’re talking about here are western yoga courses undertaken by western students. If practised daily, under the supervision of a dedicated and enlightened teacher, with corresponding and concurrent study, and a genuine desire to relinquish human conceit, I have no doubt that yoga and meditation can “quiet” the ego. Sadly, in Britain, examples of that kind of practice number relatively few compared with the heaving ranks of wellness-touting narcissists keen to use a bit of cod-spirituality as yet another excuse for rank self-indulgence. You know who I mean: the image-obsessed neo-hippies keen to purchase, pose and Instagram their way to paper-thin self-esteem, shored up on all sides by the kind of cynical marketing that somehow turns neurosis into commodity.I don’t really believe that yoga or meditation make you an arrogant, self-congratulatory twat – quite the opposite, in fact. But I would venture to say that when an arrogant, self-congratulatory twat is given a full-length mirror, a language of “self care”, and a questionnaire about their own apparent superiority, unpleasant things may start to occur.

People today don’t know it.”Brereton said the Assyrian empire was the world’s first true empire and served as a template for others that followed. The exhibition will tell the story of the empire through the lens of Ashurbanipal who, with some justification, claimed to be “king of the world, king of Assyria”.Brereton said the empire generally had a negative press as a place of luxury, extravagance and debauchery until discoveries were made in the 19th century by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard, revealing what a truly “magnificent, innovative and interesting empire” it was.Ashurbanipal was a complex often misrepresented figure. He could be seen as a “psychopathic bookworm”, said Brereton. “He was a complicated character, quite unlike any Assyrian king who came before him. He was a mighty king who controlled a terrifying war machine, but he never led his troops into battle.”Ashurbanipal preferred to stay at home in his library and was a renowned scholar who was always depicted with a stylus poking out of his belt.The British Museum show will include examples of Assyrian treasures not normally on public display, such as stunning reliefs from Ashurbanipal’s palace that have been kept in a basement gallery decommissioned 20 years ago.The museum also has about 30,000 clay tablets and fragments of tablets, which it will use to recreate Ashurbanipal’s great library, the oldest surviving royal library in the world.There will be loans of exhibits – some travelling to the UK for the first time – from museums including the Louvre in Paris, the Hermitage in St Petersburg, the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin and the Vatican.About 200 objects will be in the show, including painted glazed bricks, enormous stone sculptures, rare wall paintings, gold and ivory furniture fittings and extravagant metalwork.Brereton said the exhibition would also shine a light on the family dramas Ashurbanipal went through, including his intense rivalry with his elder brother, overlooked as emperor and not happy to be given Babylon to rule instead.He said new discoveries were being made all the time about a king who should be more widely known, but the cause of his death was still a mystery. What is known is that within two decades of Ashurbanipal’s death the Assyrian empire fell apart and was “literally wiped out”, with the Babylonians setting fire to Nineveh.The exhibition is supported by the Iraqi government, and the museum said many of the objects in the show came from archaeological sites in Iraq such as Nineveh and Nimrud, which more recently have been targeted and destroyed by Islamic State. The final section of the show will highlight the challenges faced in protecting Iraqi cultural heritage and will showcase the work of the Iraq emergency heritage management training scheme.• I am Ashurbanipal: King of the World, King of Assyria is at the British Museum from 8 November to 24 February."},{"url":null,"title":"from gucci to beyonce how the pink suit took over fashion","story":"The pop star wore one to launch her and Jay-Z’s first joint album, but she’s not the first. From high fashion to the high street, it’s one of the biggest looks of the yearUsually one to set trends rather than follow them, Beyoncé this weekend did as the likes of her sister Solange, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik and Salma Hayek have done before her: she wore a pink suit, pushing it to the forefront of 2018’s fashion canon by opting to wear it in the video for the first single from her long-awaited joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love.Of course, being Beyoncé, she did it with more of a sense of pomp than most: standing in front of the Mona Lisa in a Louvre emptied of tourists, leaving space for Queen Bey and Jay-Z to chart their own course through art history as they launched an album that has been described as “celebrating their marriage and black identity”. The pink of the suit pops against the more muted tones of the art. Its clashing red tassel belt could be read as a visual nod to the velvet rope that would usually accompany a visit to the Louvre, just not for Queen Bey.The look that takes centre stage is from the autumnwinter 2018 collection of relatively unknown London-based label Peter Pilotto. Launched in 2007, it’s a label best known for its prints and sexiness – and it’s something of a sartorial curveball from Beyoncé, even as someone who is unafraid to throw them on her recent tour, for instance, she teamed pieces from fashion gods Gucci with lesser-known designers such as LaQuan Smith. So while Beyoncé can start trends with her little finger, she is very much jumping on an already rumbling bandwagon here. The current penchant for the pink suit was arguably sparked, as with so many other trends, by Gucci. That catalyst was part of Alessandro Michele’s springsummer 2018 collection. Worn by a red-haired model who walked down the catwalk in a matching pink shirt and pink tie, Vogue called the look “Lady-Penelope-meets-Bianca-Jagger” and it has proven, according to Candice Fragis, buying and merchandising director at luxury stockist Farfetch, to be “really popular”, “in line with the colourful tailoring trend”.Beyoncé, then, is one in a long and illustrious line of pink suit wearers, but she might just be the first to wear one to an audience of two with the Mona Lisa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff9975de5330ccbc8597ec1bc77405965d5824a/0_204_2005_3072/master/2005.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8ab78a4bd821fd4ea1aa6bf3f117ee43 1400w","title":"milan menswear 10 key collections from the springsummer 2019 shows","story":"From Prada’s ‘sexy boys’ to Marni’s Olympic team, our menswear editor picks the best of Milan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdfc4d9899cb209fa15f00b6dffde2b342d7bec3/0_165_4949_2969/master/4949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05278b53974830a510a167646acc956e","title":"brazil fifa var decisions switzerland","story":"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) has asked Fifa why the video assistant referee was not used to review two key decisions they believe hindered their side during the 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday.Brazil players complained long and hard that the defender Miranda was pushed by Steven Zuber when he headed home Switzerland’s equaliser early in the second half of their Group\u0026nbspE opener. They also believe Gabriel Jesus was manhandled inside the penalty area and should have been awarded a spot kick. Neither incident appeared to be reviewed.“The CBF requires to know from Fifa the reason the technology was not used in key incidents during the game,” the organisation said in a statement.VAR is being used in the World Cup for the first time and, according to Fifa, should only “correct clear and obvious errors and missed incidents in clearly defined match‑changing decisions”.Brazil believe the two incidents, neither of which they referred to directly, are covered by that explanation.The technology has been used sparingly in Russia with only one major dispute, a penalty awarded to France against Australia that was initially turned down. The penalty, which was scored by Antoine Griezmann, helped France to a 2-1 victory. There was also controversy in England’s game against Tunisia, when Harry Kane twice appeared to be impeded but did not receive a penalty.“Last night showed major inconsistency from the referee and video referee team,” said Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the Euro\u0026nbsp2016 final. “The referee wasn’t looking at the incident – which is normal as a lot goes on at corners – but the VAR not giving England a penalty retrospectively was a wrong call. It was a stonewall penalty.“Going forward in the tournament, Fifa needs to have a think about when it is going to intervene. We’ve seen lots of good decisions but the threshold for a clear and obvious foul seems very high.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5ba224e63c74dd06e27fb1b6ade9e9831f3821/0_10_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b430c3d2d3bbe8269b4c241a9cc0472","title":"colombia japan world cup group h match report","story":"It is difficult to imagine a team making a more calamitous start to a game in this World Cup finals than Colombia did here and, unfortunately for José Pékerman and his players, there was another blow to come on top of being a goal and a man down inside a chaotic first six minutes. Yuya Osako delivered it with a towering second-half header to give Japan a victory that leaves Colombia, who were quarter-finalists in Brazil four years ago, with much to do if they are to progress to the next phase.The tone of a glorious afternoon in Saransk was set in that remarkable opening period. There were only two minutes and 56 seconds on the clock when Carlos Sánchez was shown a red card for a deliberate handball inside the Colombia area. It was the second fastest sending off in World Cup history – Alberto Batista’s dismissal for Uruguay against Scotland in 1986 after just 54 seconds will take some beating – and Shinji Kagawa was not going to pass up the chance to put Japan ahead from the spot.Down to 10 men and without James Rodríguez, who was not fit enough to start, Colombia were right up against it but showed plenty of character and no little class to haul themselves back into the game. Juan Quintero’s clever free-kick, slid under the Japan wall towards the end of the first half, brought parity. Yet Japan roused after the interval and it was no real surprise when Osako nodded them in front after a sustained spell of pressure.Colombia rallied late on but they were left to reflect on that awful start. Davinson Sánchez, who had a difficult afternoon throughout, has to take his share of the blame for the chain of events that unfolded, after he got in a tangle dealing with a routine ball over the top that ought to have been cleared. Osako somehow came out of that one-on-one duel on top, scampered clear and saw his low effort blocked by David Ospina, who had only just got to his feet when Kagawa seized on the loose ball. Kagawa’s first-time shot would have put Japan ahead but Carlos Sánchez stuck out his right arm to block and Damir Skomina, the Slovenian referee, reached for his back pocket to brandish a red card.The former Aston Villa player complained bitterly and took several minutes to leave the field as Colombian players surrounded the referee – something that Fifa are likely to frown upon – yet Skomina was left with no option and Carlos Sánchez, with the benefit of hindsight, may well reflect that he would have been better off letting Kagawa score. That view was reinforced when the Borussia Dortmund forward calmly rolled his spot-kick past Ospina.Colombia were rattled for a period and badly needed to regain their composure – something that Takashi Inui lacked when the winger squandered an excellent chance to double Japan’s lead after 15 minutes following a lovely piece of play from Kagawa, who was able to find more space in the area that Carlos Sánchez, a deep-lying midfielder, had vacated.Although Quintero and Radamel Falcao had linked up well on a couple of occasions, forcing Eiji Kawashima into two close-range saves, Pékerman got to the half-hour mark and decided that he had seen enough. Juan Cuadrado, who had been an injury doubt beforehand, made way for Wilmar Barrios, a more defensively-minded player. Another Colombian defensive error, involving the substitute and Davinson Sánchez almost presented Japan with a second but Osako shot wildly off target with the angle against him.Colombia, whose colourful supporters turned the stadium yellow, needed a little bit of magic and Quintero provided it six minutes before the interval. Falcao may well have been a touch fortunate to win a free-kick around 22 yards from goal – the Colombia striker spent a lot of time on the floor – but there was so much to admire about what Quintero did next. Anticipating that the four players in the Japan wall would jump, Quintero placed a low left-footed shot underneath them, catching out Kawashima, who frantically tried to get across his line to keep the ball out. He had too much ground to make up, however, and goal-line technology confirmed what everyone suspected – Colombia were level.Although Colombia’s numerical disadvantage was not so apparent for periods of the first half, it was a different story after the interval as Japan, perhaps stung by Quintero’s goal, started to play with much more attacking ambition. Osaka, using his body to roll the ragged Davinson Sánchez inside the Colombia area, forced Ospina into a low save and the Arsenal goalkeeper made another fine stop to deny Inui three minutes later.Colombia were hanging on. A deflection took Hiroki Sakai’s shot the wrong side of the post but from the corner that followed Japan regained the lead as Osako climbed above Santiago Arias to head in Keisuke Honda’s corner. Rodríguez, on for Quintero just before the hour mark, came close to a late equaliser but this never looked like being Colombia’s day from the third minute onwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae022d3e30675ebe89e05d247622f456c543416d/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68a61596e252882ead5557169e1a6b9f","title":"efl safe standing permitted 2019 20","story":"The Football League (EFL) expects fans to be once again allowed to stand at matches in all four isions of English football by this time next year.With the issue of safe standing set to be debated in parliament next week, the League’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, believes that a consensus between football stakeholders and supporters means it is now “illogical and outdated” not to give clubs the choice to reintroduce standing to their grounds.“It will be disappointing if, by this time next year, there is no significant movement one way or the other,” Harvey said. “Whether standing is available to fans by then might be a stretch. But clubs would be able to begin the process of putting it in place. Standing in all isions of English football by start of the 2020-21 season is a realistic aim.”“This is a local issue,” said Harvey, “and we believe legislation should be amended to provide inidual clubs, and their local Safety Authority Groups to make the decision as to whether standing can be reintroduced to any given stadium and in what form. In our view, it is illogical and outdated to continue with the ‘one-size fits all’ approach that has been in operation for the past 30 years.“We are pleased that the government has recently taken steps to review this, and we will continue to work with all the relevant stakeholders, and provide insight and guidance as appropriate, in order to see legislation amended in a way that benefits all parties for the good of the game.”Next week’s debate will take place in Westminster Hall after a government petition calling for safe standing raised over 100,000 signatures. This month the Labour party threw their weight behind the idea, calling for an immediate change in the law. And last week the Premier League, which had previously been non-commital on the issue, joined the Football League in calling for choice.The EFL prefers not to use the term “safe standing” arguing that standing in grounds is already safe and indeed is currently licensed in Leagues One and Two.“This is not a safety issue,” said Harvey. “Standing is safe and we currently have 22 EFL clubs offering full-licensed standing accommodation to supporters across all three isions. The matter being debated here is whether all clubs, regardless of the ision they play in, should have the ability to offer fans the choice they want in terms of whether to sit or stand while they watch their football team play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b86d299afe9d191f917774ea50f06f91ea5ed9/51_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bcbee5dbf867f451087e9c63e0b10b","title":"englands late world cup win sparks scenes of celebration across country","story":"Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner set off huge celebrations last night, many captured and shared on social mediaThe drama of England’s last-gasp win in their opening World Cup match against Tunisia on Monday sparked a wave of exuberant celebrations among fans, many of which were captured and widely shared on social media. The O2 Academy in Leeds was one of many venues across the country that was not only showing the match on big screens, but was also primed to capture fan reaction from the key moments of the game. They were rewarded with footage of the absolute scenes that followed captain Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner.In his post-match interview Kane said he hoped the win had made fans happy “in the pubs”, and multiple videos posted to social media suggested it had. Down the road from Leeds there were also wild celebrations in this bar in Sheffield.A lot of beer went up in the air in Maidstone in Kent when the goal went in.Boxpark in Croydon was the site of widely shared footage of celebrations – which included what seems an ill-judged attempt at crowd-surfing about eight seconds into the clip.Another fan who might be regretting their exuberance this morning is the person who appears to fall through a roof while celebrating – about five seconds into this one.Fans who had gathered to watch the match at the Times Square fanzone in Newcastle got to share the experience with two England veterans from the 1990 World Cup – Paul Gascoigne and Peter Beardsley spoke to the crowd before the match.London’s Tottenham Court Road was also a site of celebration after the game, with happy fans obstructing the traffic and flagging down passing cars to join in the celebrations.The celebrations in Leeds also spilled noisily out on to the street after the final whistle.The fact that the celebrations were so widespread was underlined as viewing figures for the match emerged. Presenter Gary Lineker tweeted that over 21 million people had watched the match - “18.3m peak on your televisions and more than 3m on iPlayer” -making it the most watched TV programme of the year so far, ahead of the Royal Wedding.If England keep progressing in the tournament, we can expect to see further scenes – perhaps a little more vibrant than they appear to have been when England actually won the World Cup in 1966."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a115953344ba308d7aa452cec3b309c78782d28/1062_418_2915_1750/master/2915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d0a5c5e1767c902619e63c7cdc4bad5","title":"panama president juan carlos varela world cup","story":"The president of Panama spent Monday night watching England play football. Juan Carlos Varela, who signed an emergency decree declaring a public holiday the night the country qualified for the World Cup for the first time, was with the national team at their hotel by the Black Sea when Harry Kane scored.Earlier, he had been in Sochi’s Fisht Stadium a kilometre away to see Panama make their debut against Belgium. And despite a 3-0 defeat Varela, hopping from foot to foot, kicking an imaginary ball as he relives a historic evening, says he is proud of his players. He also feels Panama’s hard game is now out of the way – even though it’s England next. He had been studying them after all.Three days before Varela had been sitting alongside Vladimir Putin in Red Square – and that, he says, is a demonstration of the power and reach of football. According to Varela, president since 2014 and invited to the opera gala on the eve of the tournament, the World Cup not only represents a unique opportunity for the players but for a nation whose reputation was hit by the Panama Papers revelations and which continues to seek solutions to the social problems confronted by its toughest neighbourhoods. In April last year, the Panama midfielder Amilcar Henriquez was shot over 20 times outside his home in Colón.“When I saw our flag come out with the other 31 in Moscow, it was very emotional. And when I had the chance to go to the opera alongside president Putin … ” he says smiling, the sentence trailing off. “It wasn’t the president sitting alongside Putin, it was the players because I was representing them. I told them: ‘I didn’t do anything to be sitting there it was you.’ The only way I could have been there was because the national team was playing at the World Cup. I can go on a state visit to Moscow, visit Putin, or Trump, China, Theresa May, but sit alongside Putin at the opera? I thanked the players for allowing me to be here. Two hours at the opera, listening and chatting to the Russian president about things, political questions, peace, social issues, even Syria.“Football is not just the sport itself but what it means socially, how it brings people together. To see the stadium full with almost 45,000 people and to hear that it was mostly supporting us– not just people from Panama but Panamanians from around the world. I saw a Belgian married to a Panamanian, one in each kit. Football is a lovely party. We didn’t know Russia and they don’t know Latin America. Listening to 40,000 Peruvians was incredible. And seeing the Panama flag everywhere in Sochi, I owe that to these lads.“Henriquez’s death was a was a very sad moment for us and it left a scar. But these players are an example for the kids in the barrio. The problem is poor leadership, bad examples, economics. But when they see these lads, that creates a model to follow. We can all help, everyone in their field: them on the pitch, me with the country’s security.”Varela says there are plans to build an elite performance centre, as Costa Rica did develop youth football, which is almost entirely lacking in structure and encourage private investment in the clubs and a league which is yet to generate significant income. “The World Cup puts Panama on the map,” he says.“Being in Russia is a great honour and it positions Panama: the entire planet sees Panamanian players against England and Belgium. Imagine it in marketing terms: you begin with the premise that what matters is that they know your name, then that they have a good impression of you, then maybe they decide to visit the country, look for a product. Panama can be heard, known, and project itself through sport.”Above all, it gives Panama a chance to show its footballers. “In the first half, we saw a team that played football against the third strongest side in the world, a team that’s one of the favourites to win the competition,” Varela says. “It’s not just playing your first game it’s competing with dignity as we did. There were even chances to have scored. Before the game, I said to them: when these three games end – or further along, as we don’t know what will happen – you must feel like they’ve done everything they wanted to. That’s what matters. I saw an organised, structured team that despite the scoreline never collapsed. We showed we can play football.”And then the president settled in to watch England. “I was studying them with the lads,” he says. In the hotel, a roar could be heard late on. Was that them? Did you want England to score? Varela laughs. “What I want is for Panama to score,” comes the reply. “But we feel the hard game was today’s.”England are going to be easy, then? “I didn’t say that!” he says, laughing. “All the games will be hard for us but the hardest was today.” The most historic, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff575a2ada8ab2d02f5803702231ff601c084248/155_144_2856_1714/master/2856.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f975c54fb6cbbe0bfbd45ee4730601","title":"world cup fiver england tunisia harry kane","story":"Sign up now!

Because The Fiver retains a small sliver of hope that England may buck that trend, and end up doing rather well, after a night which saw them get away with it against Tunisia. Gareth Southgate celebrated the result by conducting a terrace chant while sporting a statement waistcoat, something not seen on prime-time BBC1 since Slade were regulars on Top of the Pops, but he soon calmed down, finished feeling the noise, and quietly reflected on his squad’s strength in depth. “The guys who came on had a different threat. The freshness of Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek brought energy and a different threat to the one we’d posed. They had a good impact on the game.” A reflection you can also read as a mea culpa if you like. Because when you consider vast chunks of their performance, he’s got to pick a different starting XI next time, right?Of course, the one unequivocally good thing about the way things panned out is that Kane is now second-favourite for the Golden Boot behind Him. With two goals in the bag, and a game coming up against a Panama side so out of their depth they managed to make a Bobby M team appear coherent in attack, it’s looking good already. Could he become the first English top scorer at a World Cup since Gary Lineker in 1986? There’s a fair chance if England go deep. And Lionel Messi isn’t going to win it, is he, so the field is already thinning out. Tottenham fans might hope their man just misses out, mind you. Barcelona made off with Lineker after he top-scored in 1986, Everton powerless to resist, and they were a club used to winning stuff. Oh Spurs! Lucky their man’s just signed a new contract, eh.

Another fine match at this enjoyable World Cup. Colombia, quarter-finalists in 2014, now have a battle on their hands to get out of the groups this time, while Japan will hope to repeat their feats of 2002 and 2010 by making it to the last 16. Thanks for reading!Meanwhile Sid Lowe has been talking to the president of Panama, ahead of some game or other on Sunday.And if for some reason that doesn’t slake your thirst for all things Baz ... there’s the latest edition of our award-winning podcast!The other match in Group H, between Poland and Senegal, kicks off at 4pm. And then we’ll have seen every team at this World Cup. Barry Glendenning is your warm, cuddly, avuncular host for that one.Rate the players. Deliver your verdict on Group H’s opening game. It’s unlikely that Carlos Sanchez or Davinson Sanchez will come out top, but you never know.Here’s the match report. An instant take, with Stuart James’s dispatch from Saransk to follow.That’s Japan’s first World Cup win in Europe, and their first against South American opposition. Colombia fought brilliantly in the first half if you didn’t know they were down to ten men, you might not have guessed. But Japan turned the tide marvellously in the second period, and were deserved winners in the end. This result really throws Group H open, with Poland and Senegal to come next.The red card cost Colombia in the end. Unfancied Japan are off to a flier!90 min +4: Bacca is sent romping down the left. Japan are light at the back ... but Bacca shanks his cross straight into the stand. That was appalling.90 min +3: Colombia are on the attack. But then Arias needlessly shoves Inui in the back, and the pressure is off.90 min +2: Colombia push Japan back, but only to the edge of their final third. They can’t find the pass that would turn Japan around.90 min +1: There will be five added minutes ... and one of them has already passed without incident.90 min: Japanese hearts are in mouths as Colombia play a little head tennis in their area. Falcao and Rodriguez knock it back and forth, but eventually the former is caught offside.89 min: Mojica embarks on a gloriously persistent run down the left and nearly breaks free. But he can’t find a team-mate when he decides to offload. For a second that looked promising. Colombia really haven’t created much.87 min: Japan continue to hog possession. Sakai is doing a lot of work up and down the right. Japan have worked the flanks well in this second half.86 min: James Rodriguez is booked for a late lunge on Haraguchi. A frustrated clip on the ankles. He doesn’t bother arguing about it.85 min: More keepball from Japan. After that brief burst from Colombia, Japan are running down the clock in a very fuss-free style. Osako is replaced by Okazaki of Leicester City.83 min: Osako chases after a long ball down the middle. Davinson Sanchez does extremely well to barge him out of the way and snuff out the danger.82 min: Japan play a bit of keepball. Sakai curls into the Colombia box from the right, but Osako can’t get a meaningful header on target this time.80 min: Yamaguchi comes on for Shibasaki.79 min: Colombia continue to press. They’ve taken it up a notch now they’re behind and desperate. The ball’s thrown into the mixer, but nobody in yellow can get a head on it and Kawashima comes off his line to claim.77 min: Bacca slips a pass down the right flank for Falcao, who hesitates on the edge of the box. But Haraguchi comes back to poke the ball out for a corner. That leads, after a fashion, to Lerma backheeling brilliantly to Rodriguez from a tight spot on the right. Rodriguez bursts into the area and shoots hard, but Osako sticks out a toe to block. What an intervention!75 min: That had been coming. Japan have been in control for nearly all of this second half. Do Colombia have any sort of answer?Honda takes from the left. Osako rises highest, getting the better of Arias, and flicks a header into the top right! Ospina, having got back on his line after a brief walkabout, was rooted to the spot. So simple!72 min: Japan are a whisker away from regaining the lead. Osako, on the edge of the six-yard box but with his back to goal, tees it up for Sakai, who sends a low screamer inches wide of the left-hand post. But there’s a deflection, and it’s a corner. From which ...71 min: Honda is immediately in the action, cutting in from the right and sending a pea-roller towards the bottom right. No Quintero he. Ospina smothers.70 min: A change for Japan, as Kagawa is replaced by Honda. Then Colombia make a switch, hooking Izquierdo and sending on Bacca.68 min: It’s all Japan right now. But it’s sterile possession. Inui tries to step it up, and causes momentary bedlam in the Colombian box after dribbling down the left. But he can’t get a shot away.67 min: Corner for Japan down the right. It’s a waste of everyone’s time.66 min: A brilliant dribble by Inui down the left. He glides past a couple of lame Colombian challenges and makes it into the box. He tries another curler towards the bottom right, but Davinson Sanchez stoops to head clear.64 min: Barrios is booked for managing to stand on Kagawa’s toe from behind.63 min: This has gone properly scrappy, for the first time in the match. Colombia are really struggling to piece together anything coherent in attack. For the first time, they look like a team playing with ten men.61 min: The busy Shibasaki finds Sakai in acres of space on the right. Sakai strides into the box and unleashes a low hard shot across the face of goal. It’s harmless. He apologises to Osako in the middle.60 min: Shibasaki loops the free kick into the box. Yoshida rises highest, but can only send his header, meant for the top left, harmlessly over the bar.59 min: A free kick for Japan out on the right. They load the box. But before it can be taken, Colombia make another surprising substitution: Quintero is replaced by ... James Rodriguez, who was supposed to be unfit. Could this be a risk?57 min: Shibasaki romps down the middle, then slips inside for Osako, who shuttles the ball further wide for Inui. That’s a lovely passing move. Inui drops a shoulder to step back in from the left, then sends a curler towards the bottom right. Ospina parries at full stretch. Great shot, and a save to match.56 min: Japan have taken the sting out of this game. It’s still an enjoyable watch, but it’s not a wild, out-of-control ride like the first half. Not yet, anyway.54 min: Kagawa slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Osako. He spins Davinson Sanchez and is one on one with Ospina, albeit from a tight angle. He shoots low and hard. Ospina parries. Corner, which the keeper plucks from the sky with confidence. A decent chance, that.52 min: Colombia haven’t put a single move together since the restart. Japan will be very happy with their new, reinvigorated approach.50 min: Osako dribbles his way down the left and earns a corner off Lerma. Shibasaki takes. Yoshida stuns a low ball with a perfect touch on the penalty spot, but isn’t able to swivel and get a shot away. Japan look much better since the restart: they’ve been given the hairdryer treatment by their veteran coach Akira Nishino, I’ll be bound.48 min: Nagatomo looks up for it. He tears down the left again, reaching the byline at speed and whipping a cross into the centre. Murillo heads clear under pressure from Osako.46 min: Nagatomo tries to get Japan on the front foot early in the second half, with a burst down the left. He lays off for Inui, who was asleep. There goes that move. But it already looks as though Japan have been told to look a bit more lively. They were very passive for much of that first half against ten men.We’re off again! No half-time changes. Colombia get the party restarted. Meanwhile Kári Tulinius responds to Charles Antaki’s pre-match assertion that Japan’s nickname isn’t likely to inspire anyone to musical heights. “There’s at least one Samurai Blue song, by the band ZZ, who might or might not be named after Zinedine Zidane. I suppose it’s alright if you like that sort of thing, but I don’t.” No, it doesn’t quite have the slinky sass of cumbia, does it. But each to their own.Top-notch half-time entertainment ... courtesy of the ever-magnificent David Squires.And that’s that for the first half. It’s been superb fun. Colombia responded brilliantly to going a man and a goal down so early they’ve been the better team so far. It promises to be a cracking second half. No flipping!45 min: Some more midfield faff. It’s been a brilliant half of football, the players are allowed to take their foot of the gas a little.43 min: Japan appear perplexed at events. They ping the ball around the middle of the park, but have no idea how to advance. Eventually their move fizzles out. “Absolutely bonkers game and the mood in Bogotá is weird,” writes our man in Colombia, Joe Parkin Daniels. “My neighbours were making a right racket until the second minute (kick off was at 7am here) but were understandably silent for the last 30 minutes. Now the revelry is back in full flow.”41 min: Japan are livid about that, though no idea why. It was clearly over the line. Unless they’re protesting the award of the free kick itself: that was a bit more questionable, the wily Falcao buying a cheap one by clanking into Hasebe. But here we are. And on the balance of play, ten-man Colombia are deservedly level.This is a wonderful piece of improvisation! Quintero takes the free kick. He waits for the wall to jump, and rolls the ball underneath it, trundling the ball towards the bottom right. Kawashima thinks he’s saved it on the line, but it’s clearly gone over. What a wonder goal!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6a1481157a8922396ed6fc90686779f1f748f8a/0_397_4107_2465/master/4107.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=057476a0d19db04f4a1ce162cc6ca9a2","title":"poland v senegal world cup 2018 live","story":"28 min: Not so much end to end as box to box for the past few minutes, in a game that is very open ... up to a point. Both sides look fairly evenly matched, but good chances have been conspicuous by their absence. On the UK Coverage, Allly McCoist is on co-comms duty and is currently bemoaning the lack of movement from the attacking players of both sides. “Maybe they’re showing each other a bit too much respect,” he muses, as he points to the reluctance of the full-backs of both sides to get forward. 25 min: Senegal go on the attack again, a series of slick passes coming to an end when Mama Biram Diouf is unable to control a clever Niang pass into the penalty area. 23 min: Kuba takes a poor first touch on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and goes down looking for a free-kick. The ball breaks to Lewandowski, with his back to goal. He swivels and shoots, but doesn’t get hold of the ball properly. Wide.20 min: Poland attack and Krychowiak tries a shot from distance. It’s deflected towards Piotr Zielinski, who is on the stretch and unable to control his header on goal properly. 19 min: M’Baye Niang is looking a real handful here and is sent galloping in behind the Polish defence by a wonderful, weighted defence-splitting pass by Youssouf Sabaly. He veers towards goal, but his shot-cum-cross towards Mane goes horribly wide of the far post. 16 min: Senegal right-winger Ismaila Sarr goes on a marauding run down the inside right and is tackled by Rybus outside the penalty area. He manages to stumble some distance before going to ground inside the penalty area, but no free-kick or penalty is forthcoming. “Ismaila, no!” as Freddie Mercury once said. 14 min: Kalidou Koulibaly concedes a corner as Poland get out of their own half for the first time in several minutes. Nothing comes of it.12 min: Gregorz Krychowiak, who spent last season on loan at West Brom from Paris Saint-Germain, gets booked for a foul on Niang and Senegal have a free-kick about 35 yards from goal. Sadio Mane’s free-kick goes horribly wide he was too far out.10 min: Senegal are dominating proceedings at the moment and are attacking down the left repeatedly, sending in crosses. They’re looking quite impressive so far. 9 min: Niang does well to keep the ball in play down by the byline and lofts in a cross. Sarr looks ready to volley past Szczesny from seven or eight yards, but Maciej Rybus is alert to the danger and makes an important clearance. Good defending from the Lokomotiv Moscow man. 8 min: Senegal attack down the left flank with Niang on the ball. He drills a low cross into the penalty area, but Szczesny intercepts. 7 min: M’Baye Niang takes the corner for Senegal, but fails to clear the first man at the near post.6 min: Thiago Cionek concedes a needless corner after a breakdown in communication with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. 5 min: Poland attack down the left flank with Piotr Zielinsky on the ball. He picks out Kamil Grosicki, who attempts to dink the ball towards Robert Lewandowski in the penalty area. Senegal clear.3 min: A slow start as both teams attempt to suss each other out and settle into something resembling a rhythm. 2 min: That’s Jakub Blaszczykowski, who goes by the nickname “Kuba” and in the interests of preserving my sanity, will be referred to accordingly for the remainder of this match. 1 min: Jakub Blaszczykowski gets on the ball early doors playing on the right wing for Poland. He’s makiong his 100th appearance for Poland today, so hats off to him.1 min: Senegal get the ball rolling playing all in green. Poland’s players wear white shirts, red shorts and white socks. The teams are in the tunnel preparing to walk out on to the pitch. Robert Lewandowski leads out Poland, while Sadio Mane skippers Senegal. It’s time for the National anthems.Liverpool forward Sadio Mane is Senegal’s star player, but is just one of several players in the squad to earn their corn in England. Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye also starts, while Stoke striker Mama Biram Diouf will play up front for the Lions of Ternaga. Alfred N’Diaye, who also starts, spent last season on loan at Wolves. Substitute Cheikou Kouyate plays for West Ham. Kamil Glik sits this one out, as expected. while Wojiech Szczesny gets the nod in goal ahead of Lucasz Fabianski.Weather report: The heavens have just opened in Moscow, writes minute-by-minute reporter from London bunker. Some journalists in Russia have been suggesting the pitches aren’t being watered enough and are too dry - this should help today. Poland will almost certainly be without veteran central defender Kamil Glik, who injured his shoulder while attempting a bicycle-kick in a training session a couple of weeks ago. If he is absent, it may force Poland to revert to a back three, despite experimenting with a four-man defence in the build-up to this tournament.For Senegal, Anderlecht central defender Kara Mbodj is an injury concern, having played just two games since December, when he suffered a knee injury. His match fitness is obviously a concern.We’re recording our  World Cup Football Daily podcast after the last match of each day’s action during this tournament.

Many families, tired from their often weeks-long journey, would seek to surrender almost immediately to the officers whom they encountered.Night had fallen and Moore was waiting in the scrub by the riverside for rafts carrying undocumented migrants, when the sound of four boats and a dozen people became audible. Those crossing were arrested almost immediately by border officers.And unlike those in the boat, Moore knew what was likely to happen.“I have photographed many immigrant families seeking political asylum at the border over the last few years. “I am sure that most of these families had no idea of the new US policy to separate children from their parents during the immigration court proceedings. “I knew, however, what would happen to many of them next – separation – after they were taken away, so it was difficult for me to witness.Each of the adults was frisked before being loaded into a van to take them to a processing centre, he said.“One of the last in line was the mother with her daughter. I had spoken with her briefly and she said she was from Honduras and that she and her two-year-old had been traveling for a month to reach the US border. “The officer asked her to put the little girl on the ground while the mother was searched. Once on the ground the young girl immediately started crying. “As a photojournalist covering this story for years, and as the father of three children, including a toddler, it was personally very hard for me to photograph. Very quickly the two were then bundled into the transport van, and it was over. I had to take a few deep breaths, as it was emotional for me to see.”In the context of the debate that has convulsed US politics since the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border has been thrust into the spotlight – attracting criticism even from high profile Republicans and former first lady Laura Bush – Moore knew what he was seeing would have resonance.“I knew that this image was important. There was no way for me to know just how much so,” he said, in the midst of back-to-back interviews with US networks and other media outlets.“For me, it’s both gratifying to make photographs that matter, and saddening to witness. As a photojournalist who has worked in difficult disaster and conflict zones for many years, that conflict of emotion never really goes away.“I have always tried to humanise this broad and complex story that is often told with statistics. So, with the photos of the young girl and her mother, I hope I achieved that to some extent. People remember the photos that make them feel.”He added: “Photojournalists and reporters alike, we all want to make a difference with the work that we do. Some images have a unique power to break through the collective dissonance. Much of the time, however, even when we do our very best, our work often has limited impact on government policies. This image has energised the American public on the issue of the separation of families and touched many people emotionally. I hope it helps to change policy.”For now, however, Moore would like to know what has happened to the little girl and her mother. “US Customs and Border Protection have not been forthcoming on their status so far. I would love to know where they are and how they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089bc2ae29717f919a0e29a90576ca161e1af7cd/0_334_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b3a1165fc8a6b68a9e2ac5de609c899","title":"from overnight oats to boiled eggs is meal prep taking the joy out of eating","story":"Loved by fitness fanatics, the thrifty and eco-warriors, there are now 8m posts of pre-prepared meals on Instagram, arrayed in rows of colourful Tupperware. But is it good for you?The relationship between food and social media was once straightforward. Those were the innocent days when no meal could be declared consumed unless it had also been photographed, filtered and posted on Instagram, when the world seemed merely a stage for avocado toast, açai bowls and barista art. It was a different time – a time before meal prep.While meal prep has long existed, of course, it has grown in popularity over the past six years, aided by Instagram, where there are 8m posts with the hashtag #mealprep. Most show a variety of meals prepared for the week ahead – quinoa salads, chicken rice bowls, carrot sticks, broccoli florets, hulled strawberries – all displayed in a selection of artfully photographed Tupperware-style containers.Behind the glamour of such posts, meal prep is a simple concept: set aside a day of the week to prepare the bare bones of your meals for the following week, then store it in containers in your freezer or refrigerator until its allotted day. The theory is that it saves time in the busy midweek when the idea of cooking from scratch feels draining. It also saves money by encouraging home cooking and reduces food and packaging waste. It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet. In short, it is beloved by fitness fanatics, the financially thrifty, the environmentally minded, the nutritionally conscious and, of course, wellness bloggers.King came across meal prep six years ago, before he worked in fitness, while taking part in a shoot for Men’s Health magazine. “I was working with a trainer and meal prep has been a long-running thing with people who train,” he says. “He told me about prepping chicken, protein shakes, boiled eggs. It was so boring and bland, but it was the first time I did it and it was like: ‘Wow, it really is important to know these things if you want to be goal-specific.’ Diet is absolutely key when it comes to the whole shebang of keeping fit and meal prep makes it one more thing not to worry about.”These days, King goes “in and out” of meal prep. He has a base level of fitness and a breadth of nutritional knowledge that allows him to be a little more relaxed. But when he has a particular need to be at his physical peak he returns to a meal-prepping regime. “I’ve got a photoshoot in about three weeks’ time for my online coaching service, so in about a week, when I get back from Ibiza, I’ll be getting my containers out,” he says. “I’ll have two weeks of being very disciplined. I hate the word diet, but I batten down the hatches and focus on fueling my body the best way I can.”For King, and most meal preppers, work begins at the weekend. “I always recommend to clients that Sunday is a great day to get organised for the week ahead,” he says. “It stimulates the brain. You can spend an afternoon on the sofa refreshing your phone or going down the pub, but what about going to the market, the fishmonger, the butcher, planning your week, working within a budget, thinking about packaging?”He has a few tricks: “How you can make 30 mini omelettes in a mini-muffin tray, how you can cook eggs in bulk in an oven, how roughly two skewers would be enough protein for a meal, how blanching broccoli means it won’t go soggy after a couple of days,” he says. “You can be efficient and productive about it, but you can also make an afternoon out of it – work with your partner, put some music on.” The containers are essential. “There are many different sizes, with different compartments, which helps portion control,” King explains. “So you can weigh out X grams of meat or veg or salad.”Showing off our food is nothing new – think of the Victoria sponges, raspberry jams and prize onions of a village fete, of buffet spreads and the relentless peacocking of dinner parties. “We always have a Martha Stewart impulse in a society – we want to make something and we want to show everyone we made it and it looks great,” Elias says. “People will do that for ever and always have. But Instagram adds another level.”This is the strange puzzle of meal prep. On the one hand, it appears another symptom of an ostentatious, aesthetically preoccupied age, in which one cannot simply eat healthily, but must do so in a way that is meticulously curated and visually pleasing and then posted about on the internet. On the other, there is something so curiously old-fashioned here – a return to the culture of the weekly shop, the rhythm of meal planning and home cooking – that it is hard not to view it as a reaction to the age of instant gratification, a rejection of the world in which every kind of cuisine is available to us at any hour of the day.It is striking how many men have embraced the trend. “It’s part of a larger shift in masculinity and part of the de-industrialisation of society,” says Elias. “Manliness is uncoupled from manual labour. And, since the 80s, cooking has been a thing that both men and women can be impressed by. So, men are now cooking. But, of course, they take it over and it becomes competitive.” For those who can find neither time nor inclination to spend their Sundays slaving over a hot mini-muffin tray, there is the promise of a meal-prep delivery service, where all the chopping, dicing, measuring and boxing has been done for you.The biggest of these is HelloFresh, which launched in the UK six and a half years ago and now has 1.9 million customers worldwide. Co-founder Patrick Drake says the company ascertained that it was “all the stuff before cooking” that put off people who felt they could not cook or did not like cooking. “It was the meal planning, the trudging to the supermarket, the buying ingredients in bulk that never get used up,” says Drake. What meal-prep delivery gave them, he argues, “was a feeling of achievement” untouched by ready meals or takeaway. “The slightly intangible thing is that little moment of victory when they stand back and say: ‘I made that!’ It’s a satisfying thing to take raw ingredients and turn them into a beautiful meal.”For all its peculiarities and showiness, #mealprep might serve as “a bridge for people who didn’t grow up cooking”, says Elias. King agrees: “If you’ve fallen out of touch with how food is made, meal prep can help you find it again.”Even those who have made a career exploring the sensuous pleasures of food are not necessarily horrified by the trend. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer and Great British Menu judge Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing. It’s also a useful way, if that’s your bent of mind, to control how much you eat and your calorie intake – though I personally find that rather depressing.”King encourages prospective meal preppers to ignore the pressures of social media hashtags. “Don’t be one of these Instagram-happy people with their overnight oats,” he laughs. “Not everyone has the time, money and energy to do it like that. I think food is something that should be enjoyed it’s important not to get bogged down by it.”Some degree of meal prep can, however, play a role in regaining a heathy relationship with eating. “It’s common for those with eating disorders as part of their recovery to have input from a dietician or a trained professional and to have meal plans as part of quite a structured approach,” Quinn says. “For people with eating disorders, there can be some anxiety around spontaneous approaches to eating – for example, going to a restaurant where you don’t know the menu. So, some structured plan over a week, where you know this is what you are going to be eating and these are the ingredients, can be helpful. But this is only done with support and guidance with a trained professional. We would never recommend just going on to Instagram and seeing what someone else’s meal plan is.”I traipse through the internet in search of meal prep ideas: pretty mason jars filled with layers of fruit and granola, black rice sushi rolls, sweet potato chunks held in airtight plastic containers in shades of sapphire and frosted crystal. It is a world that seems potentially bright and crisp and exciting.At some point, I follow a link to a story about a woman in Australia who preps a month’s worth of family breakfasts and lunches in just four hours for approximately $60 (£34), but when I look at the pictures I feel crestfallen by their beigeness: puff pastry pinwheels, cheese sandwiches, containers of macaroni cheese. This, I suspect, is the more prosaic reality of meal prep.I think of something Fort said when we discussed the trend’s potential drawbacks. “The only major criticism is that it removes the instinctive and creative part of cooking,” he says. “What seems a brilliant idea when you plan on a Sunday night might seem rather less desirable when you get to a damp, cold, wet Thursday. For me, part of the pleasure of cooking is the instinctive response to ingredients, of looking at something and thinking: ‘Ah! What shall I do with that?’ And so, for me, it might be a little sterile. Because the idea of eating for pleasure, for joy, for happiness, a sense of community, seems a pity to lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c7d9cf42ea9d687bf9037355f0250612dbd661e/46_0_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d830a98e953292b8d58efb7bbd9cc778","title":"multiple orgasm clitoris science research","story":"On-screen depictions of sex show women coming again and again, yet in reality many women never climax during sex. Here’s what we know so far about the clitoris and G-spotI’ll set the scene. There will be a man and a woman and they are having sex. Up against a wall, in a bed, in a car, anywhere. Vertically, horizontally. Clothed or unclothed. None of that matters, because the outcome will be the same. Within a minute, usually, the man and woman will have an orgasm at the same time. It will be visible, spectacular, satisfying. Then perhaps, she will have another and another and another.This scene will be familiar because it has been enacted ever since sex was allowed onscreen. But it is fiction. Not because women can’t have multiple orgasms. But if they do, it is unlikely to be because of thrusting. That’s if they get an orgasm in the first place.The orgasm. “A feeling of intense sexual pleasure that happens during sexual activity,” according to the NHS. That much is known. But e any deeper into the science of women’s genitalia, and how they work, and there will be surprises. We’re still in a black hole of not knowing very much about the sexual health and mechanisms of half the population. A few things that scientists and academics are still fiercely debating: how a female orgasm is triggered, what it does and what it’s for. Things are better than they were in the 19th century, when male gynaecologists examined women while standing behind a cloak. But in the late 1970s, medical men were still having earnest discussions in the pages of medical journals about whether menstruating women emitted a poisonous substance called menotoxin, that made flowers wilt. The US National Institutes of Health only set up a programme to research vaginal health in 1992 – the male orgasm was first researched a century earlier.After climax, or resolution, the man enters a “refractory period,” where he has to recover. This varies from a few minutes in young men to 20 hours in older ones, but however long it is, there will be no response to sexual stimulation. A woman has no such barrier. If she has had an orgasm, and not faked it, she may “plateau”, but within seconds or minutes, or when she feels like it, given the right stimulation – probably (but not only) clitoral – she can feasibly orgasm again. The circumstances required include her environment, her partner (if she needs one), and her knowledge of her own body. It’s surprising, says Professor Linda Cardozo, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, “how many women don’t even know what their genitalia are called”. We say vagina (the internal passage leading to the cervix) when it’s the vulva (external genitalia). We see images of women with improbably shaven genitalia, and supposedly female dolls with no external labia. The authors of one study that attempted to understand how women’s genitalia varied in appearance marvelled that “even some recent textbooks of anatomy do not include the clitoris on diagrams of the female pelvis”. When women come to her thinking they are dysfunctional in some way, says Sarah Martin, executive director of the World Association of Sex Coaches, one of the most powerful things she can do is send them away to look at their vulva in a mirror. Using the right words is important too. Vulva, not vagina. Otherwise, says Vincenzo Puppo, a sexologist at the University of Florence, women think of their vagina as “just a hole”.Martin also tries to get women to relax. Before orgasm, alpha waves in our brains slow down. A recent documentary on the “super-orgasm” – actually multiple orgasms – found that women who had multiple orgasms had slower alpha waves than the average woman. Their brains were quieter, making more room for pleasure. “The thing about sex of all sorts,” says Martin, “is that sex takes place in the body. It’s very hard to think about pleasure if you are worrying instead of focusing on your body.”You may think differently about the vagina if you believe in the G-spot. Puppo has little patience with it, and labels anatomical illustrations with: “the invented zone for the G-spot”. It is named after Ernest Gräfenberg, who wrote a paper in 1950 about an erogenous zone on the vaginal anterior wall. This was launched into popular perception by an eponymous 1981 book written by two psychologists and a nurse, and by countless articles since. The nurse was Beverley Whipple, who told the Science Vs podcast that her team had investigated by inserting fingers into women’s vaginas and feeling around the clock. “Between 11o’clock and 1 o’clock,” Whipple says, “we got a lot of smiles.”What a great thought. Except Gräfenberg never wrote about a G-spot. He did write about women he called “frigid,” and reported that some women were stimulated by inserting hat pins. There is still no good scientific data to prove its existence, although plenty of women believe they have one. “The G-spot,” wrote the neuroscientist Terence Hines in 2001, “will remain a sort of gynaecologic UFO, much searched for and discussed, but unverified by objective means.” The debate matters, says Puppo, because “women who fail to ‘find’ their G-spot, because they fail to respond to stimulation as the G-spot myth suggests that they should, may end up feeling inadequate or abnormal”.Cardozo is circumspect. “There is some doubt as to whether a particular spot in the anterior vaginal wall is relevant in terms of orgasm. When women have had that part of the anterior wall excised, they have still been able to orgasm.”The G-spot debate hasn’t prevented cosmeto-gynaecologists from offering procedures such a G-spot amplification, a concept first offered by the Californian gynaecologist David Matlock, who decided injecting collagen into the vaginal wall would enhance sensation for four months and the chance of single or multiple vaginal orgasms. The American College of Obstetricians disagreed, deciding that the procedure had no scientific basis, and anyway, Cardozo says, “the herd of cows that provided the collagen died out”. Now the money-maker is the O-shot (O for orgasm), an injection into the vaginal wall of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from the woman’s blood.“There is no scientific data on this,” says Cardozo, with some finality, although PRP has worked in dental patients, allegedly enhancing the healing process. You probably want tips for how to get a multiple orgasm here. Or even a single one. I prescribe better research, of course. But also, better talking. Communication is as powerful as lube, whether it’s with a partner or a doctor. For women who think they need to surgically alter their vulva because they are abnormal, the American College of Obstetricians prescribes “a frank discussion” about the wide range of normal genitalia.The clitoris should be placed on equal standing with the penis. All these prescriptions can combine for as pleasing an outcome as an orgasm, single or multiple. Because it matters. The female orgasm may have a reproductive role or not: I’ll leave that up to scientists to debate, and celebrate the fact that they are debating it. Perhaps it’s enough to know that an orgasm feels good, and in these dark times you deserve it, or many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4419ee3c19292d3990f74a4a645efca3337ed/0_11_999_599/master/999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b9331b34036033fcd4091e1dd7eef","title":"beyond poppies six things you didnt know about the royal british legion","story":"From supporting veterans in emergency situations to providing breaks for service families, Legion initiatives offer a vital helping hand to serving and former members of the armed forcesBeing a member of the armed forces can be high risk and many personnel leave with life-changing injuries. The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/220cc2c15ead83cf112040227ffb90a6efb3859c/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d111d29b72bbb9d173e58a1ad56bde7","title":"rupert murdoch must increase sky news budget to 100m","story":"Culture secretary says approval of full Sky takeover will also require a 15-year commitment to newsRupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox must increase the funding of Sky News to at least £100m a year as a precondition of taking full control of Sky, the culture secretary has said.Hancock’s condition means that Fox will have to top up any shortfall in funding to keep Sky News’s budget at £100m for the next 15 years.Hancock also said that if Disney buys Sky News it must commit to operate and maintain the news unit for at least 15 years.

She had a right to. After 1960, her albums never put more than a dent in the lower end of the pop charts. And her singles made no greater impression. More, the press, the industry and even some audiences found her uncompromising performances and adamant character either off-putting or baffling.Thankfully, time has a way of correcting such perceptions. Over the last three years, there’s been an escalating appreciation not only of Nina Simone’s depth of talent, but of her defiant character. Attention for her work has been greatly amplified by Liz Garbus’s unflinching 2015 documentary, What Happened, Miss Simone?, as well as her richly deserved induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.Today, another step in her reassessment takes place. Simone’s childhood home has been named a national treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Fewer than 100 homes in the US have earned that designation. The organization, joined by the World Monuments Fund and other groups, plans to turn the now vacant and dilapidated property, located in Tryon, North Carolina, into a salute to the artist’s legacy. Today a series of events will occur around the house where Nina Simone taught herself to play piano, and where she grew up experiencing the severe restrictions of the Jim Crow south. To honor those events, there’s a deep catalogue of Simone’s work available to savor on every streaming service.Between 1958 and 1993, the singer, who died in 2003 at 70, released more than 60 live and studio albums, mainly containing cover versions of other people’s songs. Yet, the arrangements Simone created, informed by her classical training, and the phrasing of her vocals, drawn from jazz, rewrote the compositions in her own image. Some recordings, like her cover of Leonard Cohen’s Suzanne, differ so radically from the original, she deserved a co-writing credit.Some of the pieces Simone composed herself became classics, including her blunt response to the violence of the civil rights era south in Mississippi Goddam, and the pride anthem To Be Young, Gifted and Black. Over the years, Simone’s politics became increasingly radical. By the late 60s, she had no trouble asking black audiences if they were “ready to kill” for the cause – a quote captured in Garbus’s movie. Small wonder, Simone later became a kind of godmother to gangsta rap’s hardest artists.Her work took just as unblinking a view of gender. With her deep pitch, she blurred expectations for male and female singers, providing a role model for later androgynous vocalists from Jeff Buckley to Anohni. Likewise, Simone’s recordings ignored isions between jazz, pop, rock, classical music and soul.Classical piano formed Nina Simone’s musical foundation. Originally, she didn’t even want to sing. She only began to, in the 1950s, because the nightclub owners she met wouldn’t book a woman who wasn’t a vocalist. The singing style she developed showed an incredible range, marked by fierce inflections and edgy enunciations. She turned each of her covers into a comment on the song as much as an embodiment of it. In her greatest performances, she obliterated the line between what she was feeling and what she could convey, gracing listeners with a direct channel to her soul. Simone performed a gut-renovation on Leonard Cohen’s classic song. She structured the music as a series of prickly, ascending piano figures, lending each line the urgency of a question that can’t be answered.Simone composed this piece as her outraged response to the bloodshed in the south in the 60s. She banged down hard on her piano, as if pummeling injustice with every riff.3. I Loves You PorgySimone’s 1959 cover of the song from the musical Porgy and Bess resulted in her sole top 20 pop hit. Unlike many artists, who buffed the music with a theatrical sheen, Simone brought out something far earthier and erotic in the song. Simone’s take on The Other Woman – one of the most painful songs about infidelity ever penned – inspired Jeff Buckley’s sublime reading. But where his version emphasized rejection, hers puts the accent on the revenge found in the final verse.Riveting takes on this anthem of regret abound, from the Animals’ to Joe Cocker’s wrenching version. In Simone’s version, she sounds remorseful but also cynical about ever receiving full redemption. The sass of this standard could easily have descended into crass Las Vegas camp. But Simone inhabits the song’s joy with a confidence that makes it not just sexy but liberating.Jimmy Webb’s admission of thwarted love requires whoever sings it to convey abject vulnerability. While many Simone performances express unshakable resolve, here she showed an equal understanding of defeat.In one of her most erudite recordings, Simone opens with an elaborate classical piano figure, followed by a vocal that unfurls the full breadth of her range. The final vocal arc may be the most virtuosic of her career.9. I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be FreeSimone’s take on this civil rights anthem has both a political, and a personal, resonance. Though the lyric suits the singer’s many songs of social awareness, it also speaks to the inner demons she faced in her lifelong battle with manic depression.10. Who Knows Where the Time GoesSimone slowed down Sandy Denny’s existential ode to a near standstill, the better to revel in its depths. Her transcendant reading captures both the limits of mortality and mysteries of the spirit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347d2fd3933f66eff32f576b356996b65fa1e667/0_20_3275_1965/master/3275.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=56ae2c147bdc5919ba5fc5da4f1e55a5","title":"brexit no 10 to re table its meaningful vote amendment after lords defeat","story":"Final showdown with Tory rebels likely after No 10 says it cannot accept peers’ versionThe government “cannot accept” a Lords amendment giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on a Brexit deal, and will re-table its rejected version, Downing Street has said, setting up a final showdown with Tory rebels on the issue this week.Theresa May put off a likely Commons defeat last week by promising rebels a compromise on the issue in the EU withdrawal bill. However, the eventual government amendment did not go as far as one drafted by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general.When the bill returned to the Lords on Monday, peers passed another amendment, based on Grieve’s proposals and tabled by Lord Hailsham, by 119 votes, a bigger majority than the first time the issue was in the upper house.Asked if May was confident about getting her version through the Commons, her spokesman said the Lords had agreed with the Commons on the majority of issues with the bill voted about on Monday, such as customs union membership and environmental protections. He said on Tuesday: “But we cannot accept the amendment on meaningful vote agreed in the Lords. Agreeing to amendable motions would allow parliament to direct government on its approach to exiting the EU, binding the prime minister’s hands and making it harder to secure a good deal for the UK.“It also does not meet the reasonable tests set out last week by the prime minister and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union that any new amendment must respect the referendum result, cannot undermine the negotiations or change the constitutional role of parliament and government.“Our original amendment struck the right balance between respecting the tests set out by the government as well as delivering on the aims of Dominic Grieve’s own amendment. That’s why we will be re-tabling our original amendment today and will look to overturn the Lords decision tomorrow.”Re-tabling the government’s amendment, which has been roundly rejected by Grieve and other Tory rebels, sets up a vote on the issue on Wednesday, when the ping-pong process return the bill to the Commons.Earlier on Tuesday, Grieve had said he and the other rebels were not trying to bring down the government, but said a meaningful vote before leaving the EU may help to avoid a crisis moment.Grieve was criticised in some newspapers over the weekend when he suggested he could “collapse the government” and said he woke up in a cold sweat thinking about it.Grieve said the new amendment was “a mechanism by which the House of Commons could express a view, without moving to a motion of no confidence, which could collapse the government.“All of us must hope this doesn’t happen. But there is a risk it will happen, and if we have no deal at the very end it is a serious crisis.”Several MPs have suggested Grieve’s amendment is unnecessary. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said MPs would be “looking for a new government” if the current one failed to deliver a Brexit deal that could pass the Commons.Grieve said he did not want to leave such a situation to chance. “If we get to a situation where we are three weeks away from no deal … the idea that it’s a good moment to get a new prime minister, have a general election … it doesn’t seem to me a good moment, if it can be avoided,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4926721874b6ca5430473a8c4d66861e3322ac8/0_189_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=350446116162d9eda2523dc677757ff7","title":"could coffee replace insulin injections for diabetics","story":"Scientists have developed an implant which releases diabetes medication when it senses caffeine in the bloodThe days of the insulin pen may be numbered. According to researchers in Switzerland, the future of diabetes treatment will not be a shot in the arm after a meal, but a shot of espresso instead.The scientists hope to transform the lives of diabetics who need regular jabs with an implant that contains hundreds of thousands of designer cells which churn out medicine when they sense caffeine in the bloodstream.Tests on diabetic mice showed that such an implant inserted under the skin could be triggered by the caffeine in coffee, tea or energy drinks to produce a drug that controlled the animals’ blood sugar levels. To raise the dose, the scientists simply administered stronger coffee.“You could completely integrate this into your lifestyle,” said Martin Fussenegger, who led the team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “You have a tea or coffee in the morning, another after lunch, and another at dinner, depending on how much drug you need to get your glucose back down.”The implant will not be ready for humans any time soon. Fussenegger believes it could be a decade before the necessary tests and trials are done to demonstrate that the approach is safe and effective. But if it does work, it could replace the regular injections that many diabetics require. “You could have your normal life back. The implant could last for six months to a year before it would need to be replaced,” said Fussenegger.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss researchers describe how they modified human cells to make a diabetes drug called GLP-1. The drug stimulates so-called beta cells in the pancreas to produce insulin which in turn controls blood sugar levels.The designer cells contain a “gene circuit” that enables them to sense caffeine molecules as they sweep by in the bloodstream. When the cells detect caffeine, they react by manufacturing GLP-1. The implant is made up of thousands of gel-like capsules that each contain hundreds of the designer cells. “When you inject them under the skin, they stick together like caviar,” said Fussenegger. The gel capsules shield the cells from the immune system, but allow caffeine in and GLP-1 out.To see how well the cells worked, the scientists exposed them to drinks with varying levels of caffeine, from chocolate milkshakes and herbal tea to cola, black tea, Red Bull, Starbucks coffee, and a range of instant coffee pods. Herbal tea and chocolate milkshakes had no effect on the cells, but all the other drinks triggered them to make GLP-1 in varying amounts depending on their caffeine content. More than 400 people worldwide are affected by type-2 diabetes and controlling blood sugar levels is a crucial part of managing the condition. A treatment that calls for shots of caffeine will not work for everyone, but Fussenegger is optimistic. “It could be quite an improvement in everyday life for these people. I don’t know many who drink neither tea nor coffee,” he said.

Bairstow’s last six ODI innings: 138, 104, 105, 28, 42, 139.Bairstow is out, but he middled this one as well. Agar bowled and Bairstow slapped it low, hard, but straight to Richardson at deep midwicket!34th over: England 310-1 (Bairstow 139, Hales 84) The players take more drinks, after which Stanlake returns to bowling action. His first five overs went for an average 6.6 apiece, making him by a margin the most economical Australian bowler (Short, Tye and Maxwell are all in double figures, and Stoinis not far behind on 9.33). Not any more. Hales heaves the first into the stands, and the second through midwicket for four. Then he picks out fielders with two fine shots that might have been boundaries, and avoids all the fielders with two poor shots that might have been wickets, which I suppose is the right way round.33rd over: England 294-1 (Bairstow 138, Hales 69) Bairstow sends Agar’s first ball screaming to the boundary, but it all quietens down from there. Just eight from the over, which is as close to economical as we’ve seen for a while.32nd over: England 286-1 (Bairstow 131, Hales 69) Tye comes back, and displays his full range of faster balls, slower balls and somewhere in the middle balls. They pretty much all get the same treatment, Bairstow hitting the second for four, and Hales doing the same from the fourth, fifth and sixth. England’s score here will either be a world record, or (at this point) a disappointment.31st over: England 269-1 (Bairstow 126, Hales 57) Agar bowls, and Hales flays his first delivery down the ground for another enormo-six. Bairstow then tries a gentle paddle over his left shoulder, and very nearly into the hands of the fielder at short fine leg. Sixteen off the over.30th over: England 253-1 (Bairstow 122, Hales 45) Stoinis bowls, and another sweet, vicious shot from Bairstow sends the ball back into the stands, from where it returns with a large chunk of leather torn loose. It’s swapped for another, and Bairstow swiftly sets about destroying that one too, howitzering it wide of midwicket for four. Of all opening batsmen who have batted more than 10 innings in ODI history three average more than 50: Amla (50.70), Sharma (53.80), and Bairstow, out on his own with an average of 67.93 (ht Rob Smyth for the stat).29th over: England 239-1 (Bairstow 109, Hales 44) Agar bowls, and England’s tally increases by just two. So at this point we are able to speculate about the possibility of England reaching 500 they’re probably not going to miss it by much.28th over: England 237-1 (Bairstow 108, Hales 44) This is all extremely jolly, especially for those of us, such as Steve Pye (below), old enough to remember the bad old days, but you’ve got to feel for the bowlers. They’re just throwing it down and taking the punishment.27th over: England 227-1 (Bairstow 106, Hales 36) Bairstow is the question for which Australia have no answer. Wherever they bowl, whoever bowls, they get punished. He poks Tye past point for four, and then a single brings Hales onto strike. He wildly top-edges a pull, which flies high into the air and down into the safe hands of ... some bloke in the crowd, who pulls off a decent catch to great acclaim.26th over: England 216-1 (Bairstow 100, Hales 30) Bairstow completes yet another century, his fourth in six innings, from his 69th delivery, which he wallops away over midwicket for six.25th over: England 203-1 (Bairstow 93, Hales 25) Tye bowls. His first two overs went for 27. This one costs but a single. We are halfway.24th over: England 202-1 (Bairstow 92, Hales 25) And Short becomes the eighth Australian bowler. We’re not far from a full house, just three to go. Bairstow creams the ball over extra cover and into the stand. There’s no respite from the runathon.23rd over: England 192-1 (Bairstow 84, Hales 23) Richardson’s back, and his first delivery is wide enough for Hales to merrily thrash it away for four. Then his last is hoiked high over deep square leg for six by Bairstow. It’s a bit harsh, as there was some good bowling in the middle.22nd over: England 181-1 (Bairstow 78, Hales 18) This must be horribly frustrating for Stoinis. Three times Hales hits only just past a ing fielder, and from there each time it rolls away for four.21st over: England 166-1 (Bairstow 77, Hales 5) Finch becomes Australia’s seventh bowler of the day, and his over ends with Hales’s first boundary, clipped wide of midwicket.20th over: England 160-1 (Bairstow 74, Hales 0) So in comes Hales, having spoken yesterday about how much he needs runs. After three deliveries, he has none. Yet.England give away their first wicket, Roy calling for a second run with the ball already in the fielder’s hand at long leg, and being punished for it! Roy’s 82 runs came off 61 balls.19th over: England 156-0 (Roy 80, Bairstow 74) Cowabunga! Tye’s first delivery is sent over long-on, a bit further over long-on, and then a fair amount further still, a massive six! A single later Bairstow pulls for four, a shot that looked good and sounded great.18th over: England 141-0 (Roy 71, Bairstow 68) After some drinks Stoinis bowls and Roy scoops the ball in the air to mid-off, where the fielder runs towards it, leaps up, stretches out his left hand, and then watches the ball fly six inches out of reach and away for four. There’s also some good running, the batsmen twice turning a straightforward single into a sharp two.17th over: England 130-0 (Roy 62, Bairstow 67) Stanlake bowls to Roy, and he doesn’t even move his feet as he heaves the ball over cover for four. And here’s this week’s Spin, by Tanya Aldred.16th over: England 122-0 (Roy 57, Bairstow 64) Stoinis is the sixth bowler used already by Australia, and his first over costs just four. This is largely down to more good fielding, this time from D’Arcy Short, sprinting and ing to claw the ball away from the rope at full stretch. 15th over: England 118-0 (Roy 56, Bairstow 61) Stanlake bowls, and with a horizontal bat Roy thumps the ball past mid-off, who mistimes his e by a fraction, for four. There’s a fine piece of fielding from Maxwell at point to save another boundary off the last but it goes unnoticed. The poor crowd’s hands are probably almost raw from applauding.14th over: England 113-0 (Roy 51, Bairstow 61) Roy thunders Maxwell’s first delivery down the ground for six, and a few moments later gets the single he needs to complete his own 50. Bairstow sends the next steepling over cover for six more. This is a run-flood.13th over: England 98-0 (Roy 43, Bairstow 54) The over starts with a Bairstow single, completing his half-century, and ends with a Bairstow boundary, flicked to deep square leg.12th over: England 90-0 (Roy 40, Bairstow 49) A double dose of Spin, as Maxwell comes on. Three runs follow.11th over: England 87-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 47) “Just” the eight runs from Agar’s latest over. Gary Naylor is being a little harsh here. Stoinis was in an unenviable position, the ball spending so long in the air that by the time it comes to earth everyone is resigned to the wicket being taken, but the catch is still horrendously difficult. It was right at the extreme end of the difficultyhumiliation scale.10th over: England 79-0 (Roy 36, Bairstow 42) Now Bairstow is dropped! Tye bowls, and he hoiks the ball high into the air over mid off. Stoinis runs back to take it, the ball dropping over his shoulder. He gets there in time, he puts out his hands, and the ball flicks his fingertips on its way to the ground. It was a tough chance, but an important one. And Bairstow doesn’t hesitate to profit from the lifeline, cutting the next ball to third man for four, and the one after that to backward point for four more. England are in a fantastic position after 10 overs.9th over: England 67-0 (Roy 36, Bairstow 30) Between overs the physio comes on to look at Roy’s right hand, which appears to be bothering him. Not as much as Roy’s bat is bothering the Australians, it isn’t. Agar continues, and Bairstow moves off 19 with a sweep for four, and then a cut for four more. He attempts another sweep, which he misses entirely and leads to that lbw business, but survives.It’s hard to see what inspired Bairstow to review that, given that England’s need for salvation wasn’t desperate. It looked out to me. Perhaps he felt he got some bat on it, but no. So it all looks forlorn as we finally got to see ball tracking and, to general astonishment, it shows the ball missing the stumps entirely, and Bairstow is saved!Australia think so, the umpire thinks so, Bairstow hopes not.8th over: England 55-0 (Roy 36, Bairstow 19) Richardson’s over starts with a loose delivery, straight and wide, and Roy thumps it away for four. Then he hooks magnificently for six, the ball flying just wide of the West Wing and out of sight. Then he thunders the ball past point for four more. When Bairstow scored his 19th run Roy was on just five. Bairstow is still on 19 Roy has added 31.7th over: England 41-0 (Roy 22, Bairstow 19) Ashton Agar comes on and slows things down further. Three runs are scored.6th over: England 38-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 19) “A bit of a shame Johnny hit the last ball of the 4th over for 4,” writes Dean Kinsella. “I was wondering when last he played out a whole over of dots in a limited over international?” Well, it’s just happened. Maiden.5th over: England 38-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 19) Roy joins the boundary party, thumping Stanlake high into the air over midwicket. It’s too high, and not quite long enough, plopping into the turf a few yards before the rope and rolling gently to its target. He makes amends from the next delivery, which goes in a very similar direction only more so. Six!The ball went cleanly past the bat and clipped only trouser!Australia think so, the umpire did not. There was definitely a sound as the ball travelled through to Paine, but what did it hit?4th over: England 24-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 19) Richardson continues and Bairstow, licking his lips like the Big Bad Wolf lying in grandma’s bed as a child’s voice is heard approaching outside, has a wild swing at a ball that is too close to his body to wildly swing at, and misses it entirely. This sets the theme for most of the over, and with one ball to go no runs have been scored. Then Bairstow spins and sends the sixth towards long leg, who doesn’t have time to move before it’s past him.3rd over: England 20-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 15) Very much more pedestrian from Roy, the batsman getting bat to plenty of balls but not quite pinging it. Just two off the over.2nd over: England 18-0 (Roy 3, Bairstow 15) Jhye Richardson does the honours from t’other end, and Bairstow picks out long leg again. He doesn’t hit this one so well, and therefore has time to run two. The next ball he hits very well, though, pinging it off the middle of the bat and past mid-off for four, the first boundary of the match. The second isn’t long in coming, Bairstow heaving a wide ball past cover for four more. The next one was nothing more than a gentle push through midwicket, but it splits the field and speeds to the rope to complete an expensive over.1st over: England 4-0 (Roy 3, Bairstow 1) Stanlake bowls, and Roy clips the first delivery nicely off his ankles, but there’s a fielder at long leg to prevent the boundary. Then Bairstow gets off the mark in identical style, with identical results.And the players are out! Action imminent.This looks like a very unusual massage technique.Here’s our story on England’s Twenty20 team, which features both Curran Brothers but has no room for Dawid Malan, news that “is said to have left Malan both shocked and frustrated”. This is true, though Australia have lost at Trent Bridge to Pakistan (twice) and Zimbabwe.The teams in full:“We enjoy chasing as a general rule of thumb and it looks a fantastic wicket,” says Eoin Morgan, who would also have bowled first.Australia win the toss and will bowl first. “The wicket looks great and I think it’ll stay that way for the whole contest,” says Tim Paine.“It looks an absolute road,” says Mike Atherton, at Trent Bridge for the toss.Over the last 10 years Trent Bridge has been the third most batsman-friendly ground in ODI cricket in England, with batsmen averaging 36.46 runs, fully 10 runs more than at Old Trafford.Aaron Finch says Australia have “full confidence that, if we play to our full ability and push that for 100 overs rather than 60 or 80 overs, our best is still good enough”. You’ll not the presence of the word if in the middle of that sentence. England won the first two matches by comfortable margins, and the tourists need to turn their ifs into whens.For those who have had enough of the World Cup, I have two things to say. One, already? And two, here you go! It’s top-level sport, it’s not football, and so far it’s been a lot of fun. Especially if you’re English.Here’s Alex Hales on how badly he needs a big score today, and also on Thursday, and again on Sunday:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98d540d4f142157068547b30f10981fac5df368e/0_84_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23818d1defe322f6558def8470596c5c","title":"royal ascot 2018 day one live","story":"And they’re off ...

Gets past and goes clear ... Gustav Klimt tries to get back but Without parole holds on ...There’s a lot to be said for latching onto a star horse before every other punter has spotted his talent but an excess of faith can be expensive, a lesson which possibly awaits those who have made Without Parole favourite for the St James’s Palace Stakes. The highlight race on day one of Royal Ascot generally features a clash between Classic winners but this colt is stepping straight up from Listed company and, while he might be able to manage it with John Gosden’s help, odds of 11-4 make no appeal. A more orthodox favourite would be Romanised, winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineasand beaten only by Masar, the Derby winner, when he last came to Britain in September. I don’t think there was any fluke about his Curragh win last month, when he produced a really strong finish to reel in U S Navy Flag. On a fast surface here, there is a risk that that rival could pinch a handy lead off the home turn but Romanised is the way to bet at 11-2. Tip Two Win can go well again but might lack the necessary finishing kick.Calyx was very impressive in the Coventry Stakes and was picked out as a likely top-class horse after a study of the sectional times on his debut. It’s a shaming fact for the sport of horse racing that there are no official sectional times available for today’s victory at the premier British Flat race meeting as sectionals expert Simon Rowlands points out:And they’re off ... Battaash was out quick and Lady Aurelia is fast out of the stalls too ... Battaash leads ... Lady Aurelia well beaten ... Blue Point gets up late to pick off the leader and win.Calyx maintained his unbeaten record with a most impressive display in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. A son of trainer John Gosden’s former champion miler Kingman, the two-year-old had looked a star in the making on his racecourse debut at Newmarket just 10 days ago and was a heavily-supported 2-1 favourite for this Group Two assignment.The field split in two soon after the stalls opened and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle, Calyx raced enthusiastically in the group nearest to the grandstand. Dettori asked his mount to quicken racing inside the final two furlongs and the response was devastating, as Calyx quickly put distance between himself and his rivals. Gosden said: “He’s very talented, his father was exceptionally talented and he has all of those attributes. The high draw may not be the best, and he’s had to race on his own for two furlongs with a huge crowd screaming - that’s a big ordeal for him and I think he’s done amazingly well to win. “I’d love to give him a nice holiday now and come back for the Prix Morny.” Asked about the 2,000 Guineas, for which Calyx is now favourite with some firms, Gosden said: “I don’t see why not (be a Guineas horse), but I think at the moment we should see if we can win a Group One with him and then think about stepping up.” PAPossibly continuing a good day for French raiders, Finsbury Square could outrun big odds here. A veteran of 35 races, he produced a career best on his first run since joining Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, who won this race 10 years ago with Equiano. Whether Finsbury Square can repeat that effort to score at Chantilly a fortnight ago is one question that must be answered but he was only beaten three lengths in the Diamond Jubilee last year and any improvement would make him very dangerous. Lady Aurelia needs no introduction but she has started her two previous seasons strongly, so her reappearance defeat is a concern. Battaash is a huge talent but this atmosphere will be a real test for a temperamental sort and his stable is out of form.My fashion spotter says the Duchess of Sussex, better known as Meghan Markle, has chosen a similar outfit and colour scheme to the Queen at her very first Royal Ascot in 1952, the year before her coronation. Here is film of the Queen at the 1952 meeting:And they’re off ... Calyx is prominent but Vange leads... Calyx takes the lead ... Calyx looks a very good horse ... and ten days after his debut holds on the late surge of Advertise.Calyx is the sexy one here, the son of Kingman having looked so very zippy on his debut at Newmarket 10 days ago. But he won that race with a killer burst of pace and could find that weapon being taken from him by an end-to-end gallop this time. Sergei Prokofiev is a short price for a horse stepping up in distance, so the suggestion is the imposing Cosmic Law, who showed a lot of improvement to land the Woodcote on Derby weekend.They’re off ...

Bin Suroor fields Benbatl, whose Dubai Turf success in March is just about the best form on offer and who won a Group Three in this week a year ago. But horses who have a busy Dubai campaign early in the year cannot be relied on to pick up in midsummer where they left off in spring, so a better option might be the progressive French raider, Recoletos. From an in-form yard, he delivered a career-best performance to win the Ispahan last month and he travelled well for a long way behind Cracksman in the Champion Stakes before failing to stay. He is preferred to Rhododendron, who had everything fall right for her in the Lockinge.The going at Royal Ascot has changed from good to firm, good in place to good to firm all over, and the track is expected to be watered every evening after racing this week to maintain it at good to firm.The GoingStick readings at 8.30am, by the way, were:A few snippets of betting news while Ascot waits for the moment which always prompted one late, and much-missed, racing journalist to announce: “Here come the Germans”.Benbatl, in the opening Queen Anne Stakes, has been one of the big movers of the day. He was a 9-2 chance this morning but is now top-priced at 7-2, having earlier displaced Rhododendron, the Lockinge winner, at the head of the betting. Aidan O’Brien’s filly is now the joint-favourite, while Recoletos is quite easy to back and has drifted out to 6-1.No less an authority than John Gosden, who trains Without Parole, has suggested that his colt should not be favourite for this afternoon’s St James’s Palace Stakes ahead of Tip Two Win, the runner-up in the 2,000 Guineas. The punters seem to agree with Gosden on the first point and Without Parole has drifted to 3-1 from 11-4, but not the second. The money is all for Aidan O’Brien’s U S Navy Flag, who was behind Romanised, another contender for today’s race, in the Irish 2,000 Guineas but is now 5-1 from 6-1 to take today’s feature race.The movers in the Ascot Stakes at 5.00 include Dubawi Fifty, the mount of Silvestre de Sousa, who is 9-1 from 12-1 with SkyBet, while Chelkar has emerged as the favourite from five runners saddled by Willie Mullins. Ryan Moore’s mount is 11-2 from 6-1 while stable companion Stratum is out to 8-1 (from 6-1).I’ve heard from Peter Burrell, Frankie Dettori’s business agent, in relation to riding arrangements this week. He says: “Our contract with Al Shaqab runs until July. Frankie is available to ride for them if required.” So it appears the Qatari owners have made their own decision to use other jockeys on their Royal Ascot runners this week, even though one of the finest of Flat jockeys is still under contract to ride for them. Instead, they have allowed him to ride against them and I dare say he will need no extra motivation. How very strange. If I hear any explanation from Al Shaqab, I shall pass it on.Today’s odds: 5-2 Blue, 3-1 Pink, 4-1 Green, Yellow, 8-1 Purple, 12-1 WhiteCream and 16-1 Orange.The official runners and riders are in for the Royal Procession, and the Queen is in capital letters.1st CarriageTHE QUEEN The Princess RoyalThe Duke of YorkThe Lord Vestey 2nd CarriageThe Prince of WalesThe Duchess of CornwallPrincess Beatrice of YorkPrincess Eugenie of York 3rd CarriageThe Duke of SussexThe Duchess of SussexThe Earl of WessexThe Countess of Wessex 4th CarriagePrince Michael of KentPrincess Michael of KentThe Lord de MauleyThe Lady de MauleyI will be writing about the royals this week. There’s a clue in the meeting’s name. First of all we have the news that Harry and Meghan Markle, officially the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are at the races today, which will be the most exciting thing about the whole week for many. Now comes news that the Queen will have a runner in tomorrow’s Royal Hunt Cup as Seniority has got into the famous mile handicap after only being second reserve. Two horses that were originally entered went lame. Now that’s lucky. In March Royal Ascot announced a ban this week on gentlemen of the ‘no socks’ variety. Apparently, visible bra straps and fake tan are also verboten, though that might need a check. It was a Sun report. So, how will this sock edict be enforced? One scribe is suggesting there might well be masons among Ascot officials. God forbid.Entries for Royal Ascot suggest the association between Frankie Dettori and the powerful Qatari owners Al Shaqab is at an end. Al Shaqab have four runners declared to run here over the next two days, all of which Dettori rode when they last ran, but all have other jockeys booked this time and Dettori is riding against all four, mostly on John Gosden-trained runners. We’ll pass on any official comment from the parties as soon as we have it. It was reported in January that Al Shaqab had halved Dettori’s pay for this year, on the grounds that they expected to have fewer runners in Britain. Before that, Al Shaqab was having cashflow problems that led to several of their trainers being owed significant sums for months on end.Are you planning to travel by train to Royal Ascot? I have numerous times and, you won’t be surprised to hear given the mess on Network Rail recently, there have been issues. If you’re going to the meeting this week and don’t fancy the crush on the choo-choo then help may be at hand. Zeelo, the on-demand coach service, are running a fleet to the track each day. Leather seats, tables, wi-fi and toilets on board. Plus champagne on arrival and a selection of breakfast nibbles. All for less than £40. Sounds good value to me and Zeelo recently introduced an offer the other day where racegoers can travel for just £5 return if they book by entering the promo code “RoyalAscot” on its website here. Seats are subject to availability by the way so would be best to snap up the offer as soon as possible. And no I’m not getting a backhander. I just hate travelling by train to this meeting and think others ought to know about the alternatives.Sir Michael Stoute 75Aidan O’Brien 61John Gosden 43Mark Johnston 41Saeed bin-Suroor 35Paul Cole 21Mick Channon 18Stoute failed to have a winner at Ascot last year, for only the second time since 1995. Just to rub it in, his tally of 75 matches the trainer’s record set by the much-missed Sir Henry Cecil, so Stoute had to spend the whole week fielding questions from the media about when he was going to get the record to himself. Press folk are, of course, noted for their humanity, so I dare say it will be a similar story this week. At least he’s got runners on Day One this time, four of them in fact, which makes four more than he had on this day a year ago. Aidan O’Brien is showing everyone else how the game is played, with at least one runner in every race and 12 in total. Gosden has a more restrained five but they do include Without Parole, favourite for the big race at 4.20pm.“Benbatl is the worst loser of the day,” quoth Paddy Power’s on-course representative, Paul Binfield, already into full-on despair mode, as if there’s much for bookies to worry about. The Godolphin runner is 9-2 from 5-1 for the Queen Anne, which opens today’s proceedings at 2.30pm. The other one Paddy doesn’t want, apparently, is Battaash (3.40), as they have made a trading decision to keep Lady Aurelia onside in the King’s Stand, with the result that their book for that race has an unbalanced look. Advertise (3.05) is 12-1 from 18s for the Coventry, the firm reports. Later on the card, punters are evidently putting their faith in Ryan Moore, whose mount Chelkar (5.00) is 11-2 from 7s for the Ascot Stakes, while Yucatan (5.35) is 8-1 from 9s in the Wolferton, though there has also been some interest in Morando (11-1 from 12s) for the closing contest.Frankie Dettori 56 winsRyan Moore 48Jamie Spencer 24William Buick 20Olivier Peslier 16(highest career totals for currently licensed jockeys)Ryan Mighty has been top jockey at Royal Ascot seven times in the past eight years, beaten only in that time by Johnny Murtagh in 2013. But he’ll face a bit more competition this year than last, when Frankie Dettori was a late absentee. The Italian had better crack on with a few winners here, or Moore will be past his career total in a year or two. Dettori hasn’t been top dog in this week since 2004, when he was a stripling of 33 summers. Whatever happens, just remember that he’s not retiring!Here’s how the big two match up for rides today: 2.30 Dettori: (feet up) Moore: Rhododendron 4-13.05 Dettori: Calyx 3-1 Moore: Sergei Prokofiev 3-13.40 Dettori: (resting) Moore: Different League 22-14.20 Dettori: Without Parole 100-30 Moore: U S Navy Flag 5-15.00 Dettori: (forty winks) Moore: Chelkar 11-25.35 Dettori: Monarchs Glen 12-1 Moore: Yucatan 8-1There’s a guaranteed Royal Ascot pic on the front-pages tomorrow ...Despair, all those who wanted a bit of cut in the ground for this week’s racing. The going is officially described as ‘good to firm, good in places’, while GoingStick readings (8.6 or higher for the straight course, 7.8 for the round) suggest there might not be much of that ‘good in places’. The forecast is dry, warm and breezy, we are advised by the clerk of the course, Chris Stickels. He expects to put some water down after racing throughout the week, to prevent the track drying out any further.Fast-ground horses should be in their element and anything with significant powers of acceleration will have every chance to show it this week. Grinders are going to find themselves outpaced. Hold-up horses may find that the ones in front are not getting tired fast enough.The big question ahead of the week’s big-field handicaps is which side of the straight course is the right place to be. Action here last month suggested those drawn low might have an advantage but that can be no more than a tentative suggestion, particularly because jockey behaviour has so much to do with draw biases or perception of same.2.30 Queen Anne Stakes Few trainers would be more grateful for a big win at this Royal Ascot than Saeed bin Suroor, who has made a quiet start to the European flat-racing season, while Godolphin’s other Newmarket yard produced the goods in the Derby. Bin Suroor fields Benbatl, whose Dubai Turf success in March is just about the best form on offer and who won a Group Three in this week a year ago. But horses who have a busy Dubai campaign early in the year cannot be relied on to pick up in midsummer where they left off in spring, so a better option might be the progressive French raider, Recoletos. From an in-form yard, he delivered a career-best performance to win the Ispahan last month and he travelled well for a long way behind Cracksman in the Champion Stakes before failing to stay. He is preferred to Rhododendron, who had everything fall right for her in the Lockinge.3.05 Coventry Stakes Calyx is the sexy one here, the son of Kingman having looked so very zippy on his debut at Newmarket 10 days ago. But he won that race with a killer burst of pace and could find that weapon being taken from him by an end-to-end gallop this time. Sergei Prokofiev is a short price for a horse stepping up in distance, so the suggestion is the imposing Cosmic Law, who showed a lot of improvement to land the Woodcote on Derby weekend.3.40 King’s Stand Stakes Possibly continuing a good day for French raiders, Finsbury Square could outrun big odds here. A veteran of 35 races, he produced a career best on his first run since joining Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, who won this race 10 years ago with Equiano. Whether Finsbury Square can repeat that effort to score at Chantilly a fortnight ago is one question that must be answered but he was only beaten three lengths in the Diamond Jubilee last year and any improvement would make him very dangerous. Lady Aurelia needs no introduction but she has started her two previous seasons strongly, so her reappearance defeat is a concern. Battaash is a huge talent but this atmosphere will be a real test for a temperamental sort and his stable is out of form.4.20 St James’s Palace Stakes There’s a lot to be said for latching onto a star horse before every other punter has spotted his talent but an excess of faith can be expensive, a lesson which possibly awaits those who have made Without Parole favourite for the St James’s Palace Stakes. The highlight race on day one of Royal Ascot generally features a clash between Classic winners but this colt is stepping straight up from Listed company and, while he might be able to manage it with John Gosden’s help, odds of 11-4 make no appeal. A more orthodox favourite would be Romanised, winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineasand beaten only by Masar, the Derby winner, when he last came to Britain in September. I don’t think there was any fluke about his Curragh win last month, when he produced a really strong finish to reel in U S Navy Flag. On a fast surface here, there is a risk that that rival could pinch a handy lead off the home turn but Romanised is the way to bet at 11-2. Tip Two Win can go well again but might lack the necessary finishing kick.5.00 Ascot Handicap The record of Willie Mullins means that all five of his are worth a look but perhaps Alan King can trump the Irishman this time with Coeur De Lion. Place prize money has been his speciality in marathon Flat handicaps but he was a shade unlucky when a rival got first run on him at Chester last time and the cheekpieces fitted that day can help him again. Martin Harley, who has done well for King in recent weeks, gets his first chance aboard this one.5.35 Wolferton Stakes There is no shame in having been beaten by a Charle Appleby runner on Guineas weekend this year, a time when the Godolphin man was close to unbeatable. Sharja Bridge went down by just half a length that day, was well clear of the third and is ready for this step up into Listed company.You could win a £50 bet from Ladbrokes by proving your tipping prowess on today’s races.

It is a day for the purists, or that is how the theory went, at least. Three Group One races, and still space to move around before the crowds really build towards the end of the week.In fact, the first-day attendance has been outstripping the crowd for Wednesday’s card for quite a few years now, perhaps as a result of the decision to stage nearly half of the meeting’s entire roster of Group One events before 4.30pm on the opening afternoon. But the live audience of maybe 45,000 will still be nothing like the 70,000 or so expected for the final three days, and nowhere near the 55,000 who turned up for the opening day when Ascot unveiled its shiny new grandstand back in 2006.The fact that Ascot gets so many of the main events out of the way almost before anyone has drawn breath remains a bit of a puzzle.The track no longer runs all three of Tuesday’s Group Ones at the top of the card, having inserted the Coventry Stakes – which is a Group One in all but name – as the second race of the day but three Group Ones just feels like too many when the remaining five are spread out over the next four days. None will get the attention they deserve, and one – probably the Queen Anne this time around – is likely to feel like an afterthought by this evening.That is because the King’s Stand Stakes, the third race of the meeting, is arguably the most eagerly anticipated event of all, as it pits Battaash and Lady Aurelia against each other in a hell-for-leather dash down the straight. The St James’s Palace Stakes, meanwhile, is the official highlight of the day and there is a real chance that David, in the form of Roger Teal’s Tip Two Win, will knock out a small army of Goliaths from the biggest bloodstock operations in the business.Away from the Group One action, Calyx versus Sergei Prokofiev in the Coventry Stakes will probably decide the early favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, while the Ascot Stakes at 5.00 has several possible “plunge” horses lurking in the field, including Stratum, in the colours of Tony Bloom, whose Withhold landed a huge gamble in another big staying handicap, the Cesarewitch, last year.The going at Ascot is officially good-to-firm and the forecast is for a generally dry and warm week. The stage is set for a fabulous week of racing, and it all gets under way at 2.30pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f192be5db55971d9b9bf627012f05c3cd15df7ed/0_633_11430_6858/master/11430.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43612a612907f920728d46b5c87cdfaa","title":"artificial intelligence ibm debate project debater","story":"IBM shows off Project Debater, artificial intelligence project designed to make coherent arguments as it processes vast data setsIt was man 1, machine 1 in the first live, public debate between an artificial intelligence system developed by IBM and two human debaters.The AI, called Project Debater, appeared on stage in a packed conference room at IBM’s San Francisco office embodied in a 6ft tall black panel with a blue, animated “mouth”. It was a looming presence alongside the human debaters Noa Ovadia and Dan Zafrir, who stood behind a podium nearby.Although the machine stumbled at many points, the unprecedented event offered a glimpse into how computers are learning to grapple with the messy, unstructured world of human decision-making.For each of the two short debates, participants had to prepare a four-minute opening statement, followed by a four-minute rebuttal and a two-minute summary. The opening debate topic was “we should subsidize space exploration”, followed by “we should increase the use of telemedicine”.In both debates, the audience voted Project Debater to be worse at delivery but better in terms of the amount of information it conveyed. And despite several robotic slip-ups, the audience voted the AI to be more persuasive (in terms of changing the audience’s position) than its human opponent, Zafrir, in the second debate.It’s worth noting, however, that there were many members of IBM staff in the room and they may have been rooting for their creation. IBM hopes the research will eventually enable a more sophisticated virtual assistant that can absorb massive and erse sets of information to help build persuasive arguments and make well-informed decisions – as opposed to merely responding to simple questions and commands. Project Debater was a showcase of IBM’s ability to process very large data sets, including millions of news articles across dozens of subjects, and then turn snippets of arguments into full flowing prose – a challenging task for a computer. The machine spoke with a confident female voice with a natural cadence, segues and organisational structure to its speech, but it lacked linguistic precision and argumentative clarity. During the space debate, for example, it repeated the point that space exploration is beneficial to the economy several times using slightly different words. There were also times when the second clause of a sentence didn’t smoothly follow the first clause. At other times, the AI system injected random anecdotes and quotes in a way that didn’t feel entirely natural.At one point, mid-sentence, the AI mentioned the astronaut Scott Kelly and then said “voiceover”, indicating that portion of the argument had been taken from a video transcript. Without hand gestures (well, without hands altogether) or facial expressions, it was also much harder for audience members to stay engaged when listening to the robo-debater.The company has spent six years developing Project Debater’s capabilities, including data-driven speech writing and delivery, listening comprehension for identifying key claims made within a speech, and the ability to formulate principled arguments. It expands upon the capabilities of IBM’s supercomputer Watson, which is being used by companies to mine huge internal data sets – including helping doctors diagnose different types of cancer.The landmark event follows similar battles between man and machine, including IBM’s Deep Blue program beating Gary Kasparov at chess, Google’s AI program AlphaGo beating the world’s best players at the strategy board game Go and a program called Libratus beating four of the world’s top poker players at no-limit Texas Hold ’Em. Using language and reasoning to debate is a far more complicated game. “The rules of chess are very few. The board is very small and the number of pieces is tiny. Even for Go, where the board is substantially larger, we’re still talking about an extremely bounded and well-defined space,” said Chris Reed, a professor at the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee, who attended the debate. “With language, it’s not nearly so clear,” he said. “There’s a lot more flexibility in what constitutes a turn and the rules of the game.”Once an AI is capable of persuasive arguments, it can be applied as a tool to aid human decision-making. “We believe there’s massive potential for good in artificial intelligence that can understand us humans,” said Arvind Krishna, director of IBM Research.One example of this might be corporate boardroom decisions, where there are lots of conflicting points of view. The AI system could, without emotion, listen to the conversation, take all of the evidence and arguments into account and challenge the reasoning of humans where necessary. “This can increase the level of evidence-based decision-making,” said Reed, adding that the same system could be used for intelligence analysis in counter-terrorism, for example identifying if a particular inidual represents a threat.In both cases, the machine wouldn’t make the decision but would contribute to the discussion and act as another voice at the table. While the debate may seem like a stunt, Reed believes it to be an important demonstration of the limits of artificial intelligence. “It helps the public understand where the state of the art is, which means panics about the imminent robot apocalypse might be tempered a little bit,” he said.

Eight decades years later, “dude, where’s my flying car?” is shorthand for any stuff “they” promised us that we haven’t got.We have always wanted to fly, so, as soon as cars came on to the scene, we wanted those to fly too. Early blueprints for the US interstate highway grid even had adjacent runways ready for flying cars. But those never came. Now that concept of the flying “car” seems quaint or naive, a 20th-century dream fuelled by decades of sci-fi and the Jetsons, as obsolete as the model T. Yet as we’ll see, something just as good may take its place. History teaches us that multi-use vehicles are naff. What is a perfect design for an aircraft is not perfect for a car and vice versa. To try to combine the two is what UK design consultant Peter Stevens calls “an inherent, debilitating compromise” – a lesson learned the hard way.Witness the foolhardy Convair Model 118, (1947) – simply a car with plane wings stuck on top. It was forced kicking and screaming into the air on two occasions, with perilous results. This tortured Frankenstein of a contraption is a super-example of why your local bus isn’t amphibious, and why submarines don’t fly. Yet, few people wouldn’t want a personal, car-like flying vehicle that’s comfortable, convenient and liberating. Helicopters don’t really cut it, nor planes you are allowed to drive on a road, an idea making the rounds ever since the admirable but painfully labour-intensive 1950s AeroCar.It’s generally agreed runways are a no-no in most urban environments, so our “car” needs to be capable of quiet, stable, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). A feat that has proven extremely tricky, as SkyCar veteran Paul Moller has found, “nothing comes down faster than a VTOL vehicle upside down”.At present, that means propellers of some sort, but Dekkard’s ride in Blade Runner didn’t look like a giant drone. Similarly, anything with jets stuck on the wings feels like a plane, and besides, no one wants the noise of a Harrier taking off next door. To top it off, VTOL devours fuel, as in the absence of a new method of levitation, we are still relying on pushing a lot of air downwards. Technical dilemmas aside, in any future where there are flying cars, everyone will want one: motorway pile-ups are bad enough without the horrors of a 3D version. Autonomy might only be granted to police or other emergency vehicles – as in Blade Runner. So you won’t be a pilot, you’ll be a passenger, in a vehicle hooked to a complex GPS system, a frighteningly clever self-driving AI, and a whole new concept of air traffic control. All of which is difficult, but not impossible.The traffic they could soon be controlling might include some of the following, some of which are like a car, some ... less so.Terrefugia’s Transition: Henry Ford’s “combination aeroplane and motor car” encapsulated. The Massachusetts firm says it’s “the world’s first practical flying car ... making that Jetsons dream a reality”. Downsides: the Transition looks like a plane, takes off on a runway and you still need to be a pilot and at an airport to fly it. That’s a plane – albeit one allowed on the road by dint of folding up its wings like a metal bat. For the same price – about £230,000 – you could get a plane and a nice car. Available in 2019.The Pal V-One drives like a souped-up Sinclair C5 on the road, but then laboriously unfurls cumbersome helicopter rotors and yet still needs a runway to take off. Nope.From Slovakia, AeroMobil’s impressive flying car looks the part, with its super-lightweight, carbon-fibre tuck-in-able wings. But it, too, needs a runway, so it can either be used as a car, or as a plane. Great if you live in the outback otherwise, might as well get a car, and a plane. Toyota is working on a fully electric, VTOL, computer-controlled flying car. At present it looks like some hairdryers nailed to a pallet, but don’t bet against Toyota having something spectacular to show off at the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo.Israel’s Urban Aeronautics’ uses a more elegant enclosed rotor system on its wingless, computer-controlled Fancraft: “the classic vision of a flying car” (more a flying hovercraft, perhaps). The Israeli military has already snagged the technology for a rather sinister flying tank it calls the AirMule (for use in “search and rescue” where helicopters would be unsuitable). Easy to imagine the police aerially harassing us with one of these within a decade.Two examples share first prize: Terrefugia’s TF-X – an all-electric, AI-controlled, VTOL vehicle that looks much more like that car in your head, but is sadly 10 years away and the temptingly sleek Lilium Jet – the world’s first VTOL electric jet, according the the German tech firm. Faster than a helicopter, quieter than a Harrier jump jet ... even a bit like a car. Finally, no mention of flying cars must pass without an honourable award for gallantry to Paul Moller and his stylish “volantor” – a VTOL plane-like car that started life in 1965 as a drivable flying saucer. Fifty years later, it is still awaiting investment.It’s probably a matter of when, not if, road-based travel becomes obsolete – the likes of Uber already show the will is finally there and the tech is tantalisingly close.Regulatory hurdles aside, we may see VTOLs flying over our cities very soon ... but whether they will allow you to drive one is another thing.

The border separations, however, appear to have crossed a new line as the audio recording emerges, as well as harrowing photos of children in tears or in fenced cages, provoking some to draw comparisons with concentration camps.The process has triggered condemnation from four former first ladies: Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush (who called it “cruel” and “immoral”), Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has released a statement saying she “hates to see” children separated from their families.The separations followed the April announcement of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, under which everyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be prosecuted. Consequently, more adults are being jailed, pending trial, and their children are removed from them. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families in the past six weeks.In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents.Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017.\u0026nbspMore than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice.\u0026nbspThey are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US.This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. By\u0026nbspAmanda Holpuch\u0026nbspShe denied that any children had been mistreated and argued: “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border … Parents who entered illegally are by definition criminals … By entering our country illegally often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.”The homeland security department, she continued, was merely enforcing the law in a way that past administrations had failed to do. “Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.”Nielsen called on Congress to close loopholes in the law so families could stay together. “Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.”John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and Nielsen’s predecessor at homeland security, told National Public Radio in May that deterrence was “a big part” of the policy. Asked if the situation was therefore playing out as intended, Nielsen replied: “I find that offensive.”Nielsen was followed at the podium by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who said the White House would reject a narrow fix by Congress to address the issue and that Trump’s priorities, such as funding a border wall and tightening immigration laws, must also be met. She said: “We want to fix the whole thing, we don’t want to tinker with just part of it.”As the issue overwhelmed TV news networks and threatened to cause lasting damage to America’s reputation abroad, Trump himself weighed in at an event ostensibly promoting his National Space Council. He repeated his past attempt to deflect blame to the Democrats, whom he branded “obstructionists”, and urged them to find a legislative solution.“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” the president said. “It won’t be. If you look at what’s happening in Europe, if you look at what’s happening in other places, we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.”But Democrats rejected that assertion. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, responded to Nielsen’s remarks by saying: “This utter lack of compassion and respect for basic human dignity is grotesque. And the blind contempt his staff has shown toward anyone pointing out the truth is a vile disgrace. This is not who we are. The American people are watching.”The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and senators Kamala Harris of California and Tina Smith of Minnesota called on Nielsen to resign. Smith said: “She’s denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she ‘wouldn’t apologize’ for what’s happening to families. Kirstjen Nielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency.” Immigration is usually a rallying point for the Trump base but even some of his supporters have raised objections to the current action. The Rev Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, said: “It’s disgraceful, and it’s terrible to see families ripped apart, and I don’t support that one bit.” Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former communications director, told CNN: “I hope he changes it today, frankly. This is very, very bad for the Republican party, and this is bad for the president. I want to see him win re-election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83214e0338072099f70e9f40038a2c7621e0e9c/0_183_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f4b966fdbe021276e64cb0e1fdd341","title":"west point commie cadet us army socialist views red flags","story":"West Point graduate Spenser Rapone’s views raised red flags after he posted the message ‘communism will win’ on TwitterA West Point cadet who wore a Che Guevara T-shirt to his graduation and posted a message online saying “communism will win” has been discharged from the US army.The images Spenser Rapone posted on Twitter from his May 2016 West Point graduation were meant to shock: in one, he opens his dress uniform to expose a T-shirt with a red image of the socialist icon Che Guevara. In another, he raises his fist and flips over his cap to reveal the hand-scrawled message: “Communism will win.” The images, posted later in 2017, drew vitriol and even death threats. Now the second lieutenant who became known as the “commie cadet” is out of the army with an other-than-honorable discharge. Top brass at Fort Drum’s 10th Mountain Division accepted Rapone’s resignation on Monday after an earlier reprimand for “conduct unbecoming of an officer”. Rapone said an investigation found he went online to advocate for a socialist revolution and disparage high-ranking officers and US officials. The army said in a statement only that it conducted a full investigation and “appropriate action was taken”. An unrepentant Rapone summed up the fallout in a tweet on Monday that showed him extending a middle finger at a sign at the entrance to Fort Drum, accompanied by the words: “One final salute.” “I consider myself a revolutionary socialist,” the 26-year-old said. “I would encourage all soldiers who have a conscience to lay down their arms and join me and so many others who are willing to stop serving the agents of imperialism and join us in a revolutionary movement.” Rapone said his journey to communism grew out of his experiences as an army ranger in Afghanistan before he was accepted into the US Military Academy. And those views only hardened during his studies of history as one of the academy’s “Long Gray Line”. He explained that he took the offending selfies at his May 2016 West Point graduation ceremony and kept them to himself until last September, when he tweeted them in solidarity with the NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was taking heat for kneeling for the national anthem to raise awareness of racism. Many other military personnel also tweeted in favor of Kaepernick, although most were supporting free speech, not communism. West Point released a statement after Rapone posted the photos, saying his actions “in no way reflect the values of the US Military Academy or the US Army”. And the US senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called on the secretary of the army to remove Rapone from the officer ranks. “While in uniform, Spenser Rapone advocated for communism and political violence and expressed support and sympathy for enemies of the United States,” Rubio said on Monday, adding: “I’m glad to see that they have given him an ‘other-than-honorable’ discharge.” One of six children growing up in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Rapone said he applied to West Point, which is tuition-free, because he couldn’t afford college. He was nominated out of high school by the then US representative Jason Altmire in 2010. “He was an honors student, an athlete, a model citizen who volunteered in the community,” recalled Altmire, a Democrat. “During the interview, he expressed patriotism and looked just like a top-notch candidate. There were no red flags of any kind.” Rapone was not accepted to West Point, so he enlisted. He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 and was assigned as an assistant machine gunner in Khost province. “We were bullies in one of the poorest countries on Earth,” Rapone said. “We have one of the most technologically advanced militaries of all time and all we were doing is brutalizing and invading and terrorizing a population that had nothing to do with what the United States claimed was a threat.” Towards the end of his deployment, he learned that West Point fulfils a certain quota of enlisted soldiers every year. Despite his growing disillusionment about the military, he applied and got in. “I was still idealistic,” he said.” I figured maybe I could change things from inside.” In addition to classic socialist theorists such as Karl Marx, Rapone says he found inspiration in the writings of Stan Goff, a retired special forces master sergeant who became a socialist anti-war activist. While he was a cadet, Rapone’s online postings alarmed a West Point history professor, who wrote Rapone up, saying his online postings were “red flags that cannot be ignored”. Rapone was disciplined but still allowed to graduate. Greg Rinckey, an attorney specializing in military law, said it was rare for an officer out of West Point to receive an other-than-honorable discharge. He added that it was also possible the military academy could seek repayment of the cost of Rapone’s education because he did not serve the full five-year service obligation required upon graduation. “I knew there could be repercussions,” said Rapone, who is scheduled to speak at a socialism conference in Chicago next month. “Of course my military career is dead in the water. On the other hand, many people reached out and showed me support. There are a lot of veterans both active duty and not that feel like I do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89413aedd74bf20880740fd9b526995263486712/0_69_4833_2900/master/4833.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd99469170d3f636cca7d5c28f02622a","title":"call me mr president emmanuel macron scolds teenager","story":"Macron told off a teenager during visit to Mont Valerian fort where French resistance members were executedLike most politicians, French President Emmanuel Macron seems to enjoy pressing the flesh and posing for selfies when on public outings.Just don’t call him by a nickname.A cheeky teen who dared greet him with a breezy “How’s it going, Manu” during an official outing near Paris on Monday was left red-faced after receiving a sharp dressing-down from the 40-year-old centrist.“No, you can’t do that, no, no, no, no,” Macron told the youngster who was waiting with a group of schoolfriends to meet him during his visit to the Mont Valerien fort near Paris, where hundreds of French Resistance members were executed during the second world war.“Sorry, Mr President,” the teenager said, looking abashed.Macron told the teen, who had begun by singing a few lines from the Socialist anthem The Internationale – a dig at the president’s pro-business reforms – to “do things in the right order”.“The day you want to start a revolution you study first in order to obtain a degree and feed yourself, ok? And then you can lecture others,” he said.The exchange, which was captured on camera, was widely shared on social media.It comes as Macron – who adopted a regal, top-down style on taking office – himself faces criticism for his at-times blunt language.In an official video shared by his office last week he complained that the French were spending a “crazy amount of dough” on social security.Macron’s critics held the video up as evidence that the man they call the “president of the rich” lacked empathy with the poor.Last year, Macron also raised the hackles of the left by calling protesting opponents of his labour reforms “slackers”.

Analysts believe Kim is in China to brief Xi on the summit, seek economic assistance, as well as pay deference to Beijing, which is eager to emphasise its role in talks between North Korea, the US, and South Korea.“We hope this visit can help to further deepen China-North Korea relations, strengthen strategic communication between both countries on important issues and promote regional peace and stability,” spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing.Kim’s visit comes after a historic summit in Singapore where he and Trump signed a joint declaration pursue complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. In exchange for that pledge, the US has cancelled military exercises with South Korea, something Beijing had previously floated and known as the “freeze for freeze” initiative.Kim is expected to ask Xi for help in easing international sanctions. China is North Korea’s largest trading partner, but international sanctions have crippled North Korea’s economy and drained the country’s foreign currency reserves. After the summit, China suggested international sanctions on Pyongyang could be lifted.“I think Kim seeks sanctions relief and wants to ensure he has Chinese support as North Korea prepares to discuss details of negotiations with the US aimed at denuclearisation, security assurances, and other issues,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Xi undoubtedly wants to get a readout of the summit with Trump from Kim.”The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a press briefing last week that China had committed to keeping sanctions until Pyongyang had achieved complete denuclearisation. On Tuesday, Geng said sanctions were not “a goal in themselves”.“A diplomatically negotiated settlement with the main parties involved in the region would satisfy China’s desire to maintain stability in its immediate neighbourhood and prevent the increased militarisation of the region.”On Tuesday, Chinese state media broke with precedent and announced Kim’s two-day visit. Previous visits by North Korean leaders have been shrouded in secrecy and confirmed only after their departure. Security was heightened along Beijing’s Changan avenue as well as the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, where Kim and his wife stayed in March. Kim brought his wife and the two attended a performance as well as a banquet, according to CCTV. On Sunday, Chinese state media reported Kim had sent Xi a congratulatory letter and a floral basket for his birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de203bf3bb65ded1559e73419481e8b934d4b45/40_0_1013_608/master/1013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93daba6b3d8439c52b0d563ce0b20a84","title":"saudi backed yemeni forces capture hodeidah airport","story":"Military advance comes after UN envoy fails to broker ceasefire with Houthi rebelsSaudi-backed Yemeni government forces have captured the airport at Hodeidah and have started preparations for the more complex task of capturing the city and its port nine miles (15km) to the north. The port is critical to the supply of aid to the rest of the famine-struck country.Confirmation that the airport on the southern outskirts of the city had been seized after three days of fighting came from both TV pictures and eyewitness accounts. At least 40 Houthi fighters who had held the airport were killed, but most retreated into the city, preparing to fight a potentially intense street-by-street campaign that could endanger tens of thousands of civilians.The military advance came after the UN special envoy for Syria, Martin Griffiths, left the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, after failing to broker a ceasefire that would have seen the port taken under UN control. Griffiths provided a closed-door briefing to the UN security council by satellite link on Monday, but departed Sana’a without speaking to the press.The security council has been ided over whether to demand a ceasefire, and Russia, its current chair, gave a downbeat assessment of the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough after the meeting. Most western states oppose the Iranian-backed Houthi takeover of Yemen, but also assert a military solution to the civil war is not possible.The Saudi and UAE forces that are providing military support to the campaign by the Yemeni government led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to win back control of the port insisted Houthi surrender had to be unconditional, rejecting proposals that the rebels remain in the city, but the port could be placed under UN control. The port is currently functioning.The UAE insists it has elaborate contingency aid plans in place if the battle for the port is either prolonged or leads to damage to its infrastructure, so interrupting the supply of food, water and fuel.But the International Rescue Committee said these assurances were little but “a publicity stunt meant to draw attention away from the undue suffering the attack is causing”.Amanda Catanzano, the aid agency’s policy director said: “The so-called relief plan announced by the Arab coalition in Yemen must be seen for exactly what it is a justification to launch an attack that will have catastrophic consequences. The modalities for the delivery of this plan are vague, and the plan alone will not address the underlying causes of conflict in Hodeidah, nor the level of humanitarian need that will be created by a siege or attack on the port and the city itself.“Nobody following this war for the past three plus years can believe that the Saudi coalition has any intention of prioritising the wellbeing of Yemeni civilians. The Hadi government, backed by this coalition, has been in control in Aden and other areas in southern Yemen for three years, yet, innocent Yemeni civilians living in these areas continue to suffer from a total lack of basic healthcare and critical life-saving services.”According to the International Organisation for Migration, 76,000 people have been displaced across the 13 districts of the Hodeidah governorate since the Saudi-led advance began. The numbers that have left the city itself is put as low as 6,000, but many exit routes have been blocked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3536168.1529417549!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"offaly td carol nolan resigns from sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeputy Carol Nolan, who had been suspended,  has written to Sinn Féin informing them she will not be returning to the party.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTwo out of three British voters who backed Brexit would prefer to see a hard border in Ireland than for Britain to remain in the EU customs union, according to a new poll.Only one in three British voters said they could not accept a different status for Northern Ireland after Brexit and six out of 10 Leave voters said that leaving the EU was more important than keeping the United Kingdom together.The poll by Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft found that, given a straight choice between a hard border and remaining in the customs union, 41 per cent of all voters would choose a hard border compared to 32 per cent who would remain in the customs union. Leave voters would choose a hard border by 66 per cent to 10 per cent and Conservative voters would make the same choice by 67 per cent to 14 per cent.Remain voters would stay in the customs union rather than see a hard border by 55 per cent to 21 per cent and Labour voters would make the same choice by 47 per cent to 25 per cent.More than nine out of 10 unionists in Northern Ireland, and three out of four Conservatives in Britain, agreed that the Border issue is being “deliberately exaggerated by politicians and others to suit their own political agenda.”Writing in the Daily , Lord Ashcroft said that most British voters thought Brexit was taking too long, with Leave voters often blaming those who want to soften or delay Britain’s exit from the EU.“Given these views - impatience with the process, determination for the UK to operate an independent trade policy, and the suspicion that Brexit opponents are deliberately throwing up hurdles - it is not hard to imagine how Leave voters would react if told the UK would not be taking back as much control as they hoped because of the Irish border, an issue they believe is being blown out of proportion,” he wrote.Only one in three voters in Britain said it would be completely unacceptable for Northern Ireland to have a different status in the EU from England, Scotland and Wales. Three in 10 said such an outcome “would not be ideal, but would be acceptable as part of a deal to get a sensible Brexit arrangement”. And most British voters said that they did not have a view about whether Northern Ireland should remain in the UK, saying it was for the people there to decide.Lord Ashcroft’s poll found that, asked to choose between keeping the UK together and leaving the EU, 63 per cent of British voters would leave the EU, compared with 27 per cent who would keep the UK together. Among Conservative voters, 73 per cent would choose leaving the EU with just 22 per cent saying they would keep the UK together. Labour voters would choose leaving the EU over keeping the UK together by 50 per cent to 34 per cent.“Those who have pondered Brexit’s consequences for UK union have usually focused on the resentment felt in places where majorities voted to remain in the EU,” Lord Ashcroft wrote.“But there is another risk: that a question like the Irish border, which most Leave voters see as a relatively minor practical issue that could be resolved, should prevent the majority getting the Brexit they think they voted for.”Lord Ashcroft conducted separate polls with 3,294 voters in Britain, 1,666 in Northern Ireland and 1,500 in the Republic, along with focus groups in a number of towns and cities.A majority of voters in Northern Ireland said they thought Brexit had made Irish unification in the foreseeable future more likely, a view shared by just four in 10 in the Republic. Asked how they would vote if there was a border poll tomorrow, 49 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would vote to stay in the UK, while 44 per cent would vote for a united Ireland.In the Republic, 35 per cent of voters said they would like to see a united Ireland in the next few years but 56 per cent said it would not be practical or affordable in the immediate future.Voters in Northern Ireland were more pessimistic about their own future than they were when they looked across the Border at the Republic. 64 per cent said Northern Ireland was on the wrong track, compared to 25 per cent who thought it was on the right track. But 55 per cent of those in Northern Ireland said the Republic was on the right track, compared to 35 per cent who said it was on the wrong track.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is textbook-changing stuff.”The photosynthesis recognisable to many from current textbooks involves\u0026nbspthe green pigment chlorophyll-a, which gives plants their distinctive hue.This pigment absorbs red light while reflecting away greens, blues and purples.Science news in pictures123 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 223 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 323 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.423 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

It can range from seeing a child wearing the same shirt for a few days, or noticing that they haven’t washed when they get changed for PE. We won’t stand by if we know people are in need,” she said.“It’s not always an impact on families that are on benefits – it can be self-employed families or those made redundant. More and more households are falling on hard times.“It’s becoming part of my year on year budgets. We try to look at the budget very carefully to put that money aside to allocate towards these products. Staff are even buying extra bits to distribute it to families when they go shopping.“I didn’t come into the profession to see children suffer.

Responding to the findings, Dr Richard Woolfson, a child psychologist, said: “Children’s self-esteem is greatly affected by the reaction of those around them – and if they are stigmatised, ridiculed or rejected by their peers because of poor basic hygiene, their sense of self-worth will quickly nose-e.\u0026nbsp“That’s why hygiene poverty has such a devastatingly negative effect on a child’s psychological development, not just on their health but also on their confidence, self-esteem, social relationships and class work.”Government figures published earlier this year\u0026nbspshowed the number of children in poverty across the UK had surged by 100,000 in 12 months, with 4.1 million children\u0026nbspliving in relative poverty after household costs -\u0026nbspthe worst figures since the financial crisis.A Government spokesman said: “We want all children to have the very best chances in life. We know that the best route out of poverty is through employment, and since 2010 an extra three million people are now in work and 300,000 fewer children are living in absolute poverty. Meanwhile, we spend around £90bn a year on working-age benefits, including for those on low incomes.“We continue to support the country’s most disadvantaged children through free school meals. Additionally, £2.5billion funding is given to schools through the Pupil Premium to support their education.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While thousands were asked to come to UK to help rebuild after the war, the Home Office is showing them nothing but disdain when they are heroes. I want this government to show respect for those who helped the UK off its knees and an amnesty for the Windrush generation, whichever country they are from.”\u0026nbspIn one case, 73-year-old Indian grandmother Raj Rani Bhanote, who has lived in the UK for 55 years, was stranded in the US for four days after being blocked from boarding a plane back to Britain.Ms\u0026nbspBhanote was questioned by British Airways check-in staff as she tried to board a flight from Arizona after visiting relatives. They claimed not to recognise the stamp on her Indian passport, designed to prove her right to remain in the UK.Staff contacted the Home Office, which claimed she was not a British resident, and she was not allowed to board the aircraft. It took four days for the government’s\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce to intervene so she could return home.\u0026nbspMs Bhanote, who has three children and four grandchildren in the UK and worked as a\u0026nbsppost office assistant, told The Independent she felt “terrible”, adding: “I spoke to someone on the phone who refused to speak to my family and could not understand why they were behaving in such a disrespectful manner towards me.”Her son,\u0026nbspArun\u0026nbspBhanote, has since written to his MP to request an investigation by the Home Office into what he described as “racist maladministration and xenophobic calamity”.Satbir\u0026nbspSingh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the case was a “disturbing but sadly all-too-common occurrence”.“Cases like this show just how incredibly complicated, rigid and inhumane our immigration system has become,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It’s a relief that the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce was able to help in this case, but it also shows the need for such remedies to be available to everybody who faces poor decision-making either at the Home Office or at the border.”It comes as the government announced that a\u0026nbspday celebrating the Windrush generation and their descendants was\u0026nbspto be held annually, after it emerged a large number of\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspCaribbean\u0026nbspnationals had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials in the UK.But Alessandra\u0026nbspSciarra, from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Network, which supports migrants and refugees in south London, said they had seen at least a dozen cases of non-Caribbean Commonwealth citizens encountering\u0026nbspsimilar issues\u0026nbspin the past six months.“They extend to people from different countries it’s much more widespread.\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspis just the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Ms Sciarra\u0026nbspsaid one of their cases involved a 65-year-old Indian man who was born in Uganda and became a British protected person after fleeing persecution to the UK in 1972.\u0026nbspDespite living here since, working and building a family, and never encountering any issues with his immigration status, he has recently been unable to find work due to issues with his documents.“In the 46 years he has been living in the UK, he has integrated successfully into his community in Lewisham. His wife and adult children were all recognised as British citizens,” she\u0026nbspsaid.“But recently Mr Khan lost his job and began looking for employment again just prior to retirement. He faced numerous issues in this process, as many employers asked him for a proof of his right to reside and work in the country.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said one of her constituents, of Ghanaian descent who has been in Britain for over 50 years, had recently contacted her after had been threatened with deportation.The Labour MP said: “The Windrush scandal goes way beyond the people that stepped off Empire Windrush or even all those from the Caribbean. Everyone from the Commonwealth who came here before 1973 could get caught up in the scandal, including deportation or detention.“These are not isolated mistakes. They are a product of the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, and Theresa May’s instruction to ‘deport first, appeal later’. Until these end, the scandal will not go away.”The Home Office declined to disclose the exact number of non-Caribbean cases​​ the taskforce was dealing with.Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said his office received on average three cases a week – or around 150 a year – from Indian nationals who have lived in the UK for more than a decade but are now denied their rights and in some cases threatened with deportation.“It is not just Windrush cases,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There is a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to deal with cases promptly. Delay is being used as a substitute for decision-making.“There are a lot of people who are from India who have been in this country for 20 years, but are being held in a long queue being made to sign on and\u0026nbspcannot work, but are actually entitled to stay here.“As a result, people can stay for a very long time – as long as 20 years – and still not know precisely where they stand. Some inevitably\u0026nbspget removed without anyone intervening. They live in a subculture of society\u0026nbspand so are reluctant to come forward, but actually they do have the right to stay.”Mr Vaz raised concerns that the Home Office had “erted resources” from dealing with immigration cases from the Indian subcontinent in order to set up the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

South Korea and the Pentagon announced they would halt the annual Freedom  military drill scheduled for August.In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days. Previously China would only confirm Kim had visited after he had left the country. No other details were provided.A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles. China is North Korea\u0027s most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear and missile tests.Police tightened security along Beijing\u0027s main Changan Avenue, which leads to the Great Hall of the People where Chinese leaders normally meet visiting heads of state, and also outside the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Kim stayed with his wife during his March visit to Beijing.Outside the east gate of the Great Hall, where foreign leaders are officially welcomed, authorities had erected a screen running the full length of the road, cutting off the view behind it.China has welcomed the warming of ties between Washington and Pyongyang, and offered to help.Beijing has been particularly pleased by Trump\u0027s announcement to suspend military drills, which China has long pushed for under its dual suspension proposal, whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, so both sides can sit down for talks.South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom  military drill scheduled for August, according to a South Korean defence ministry statement.A Pentagon statement confirmed the suspension and added that there would be a meeting between the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump\u0027s national security adviser on the issue this week.North and South Korea agree to joint teams for Asian GamesUS and South Korea \u0027poised to halt war games within days\u0027Asia\u0027s fine balance of military power is about to change completelyTrump salutes North Korea general in exchange aired on state televisonMike Pompeo says no sanctions relief until North Korea denuclearises Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in the Ulchi Freedom  drills, although the exercise is mostly focused on computerized simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump made his remarks after the Singapore meeting.Japan\u0027s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which also engage in regular deterrence exercises against North Korea.The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations\u0027 defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan, Suga said in a regular briefing.The Pentagon has yet to publicly release the cost of previous and future joint military exercises with South Korea, a week after Trump cited their tremendously expensive cost as a reason for halting them.Spending data for previous military exercises in Korea and elsewhere, however, suggest that the cost of a single exercise would be in the low or perhaps tens of millions of dollars in a U.S. military budget this year of nearly $700 billion.In response to repeated requests for cost data, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, said: We are currently evaluating the costs of the exercises.Calculating the cost of military exercises is a complicated process, often requiring data from different branches of the military and spread over several budgets over different years.Troops who would have been involved in the exercises would still require training and certification, which would still cost money, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.To me, the idea of this as a cost saving measure doesn\u0027t really make much sense, Denmark said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Combined, they make up one in every 110 people on the planet.Just over 16.2 million were freshly forced from their homes in 2017 alone, meaning that a new person became displaced every two seconds. And the number of asylum-seekers, trapped in limbo awaiting the outcome of their claims, rose above 3 million.But the global scale of the problem is not being matched by an international response, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi.Refugee children abused and illegally returned at France-Italy borderRohingya facing ‘crisis on top of crisis’ as world looks other wayMyanmar says it is willing to take back all Rohingya refugeesSyria’s new housing law will displace tens of thousands of refugeesPolice clear migrants from biggest illegal camp in ParisHungary considering making offering food to refugees illegalVast numbers of refugees are living in just a handful of countries closest to conflict zones, with the likes of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Uganda and Bangladesh taking people in at far higher rates than the global average.“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” Mr Grandi said.Mr Grandi also highlighted the helplessness of those who had “no choice” but to flee their homes. Of the global displaced population, a staggering 53 per cent are children. Their number, the UN said, includes many who are unaccompanied or separated from their families.And among the specific case studies highlighted by the report were the Rohingya, 655,000 of whom fled Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in the space of just three months from late August 2017.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspA senior UN official has previously described violence towards the Rohingya by the Myanmar army as a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing”. The government of Myanmar has for generations refused to acknowledge the Muslim minority’s right to citizenship in northern Rakhine state, insisting they are illegal immigrants from neighbouring states.“Nowhere is the link between statelessness and displacement more evident than for the Rohingya community of Myanmar, for whom denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the entrenched discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight for decades,” Mr Grandi said.Life in a Palestinian refugee campAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longThe UN report does conclude with what Mr Grandi calls a “reason for some hope”, however, pointing towards a shared agreement currently being drafted by the UN in response to the global refugee crises. Dubbed the Global Compact on Refugees, it would see displaced people resettled more equitably and put in place basic standards for things like healthcare access from the moment refugees cross into another country.“Today, on the eve of World Refugee Day, my message to member states is please support this,” Mr Grandi said. “No one becomes a refugee by choice but the rest of us can have a choice about how we help.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa.

To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

Teachers and young people have responded well to the introduction of the new qualifications and we trust schools to provide the right support to young people during exam season.”Earlier this month we reported how students were left in floods of tears by this summers GCSE and A-level exams.They have even suffered panic attacks after a shake-up of the system saw some forced to sit over 30 papers.The changes saw 18-year-old vlogger Jade Bowler emerge from her biology A-level in floods of tears.The new exams has seen schools forced to hold early morning revision sessions and some have resorted to sending teachers to anxious pupil’s houses to make sure they turn up, according to The Sunday Times."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004144901971.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal ascot 2018 drinking races fans","story":"Well-heeled revellers kicked off the first day of the eagerly anticipated racing event with glasses of champagne and pints of lager as thousands flocked to have a flutter.Ladies donning colourful frocks and gents in top and tails were spotted racing to the Berkshire tracks many bars, as they enjoyed the highlight of the horse racing calendar.In a boisterous mood, some were happy to dance around and pose for photographers, while others preferred to enjoy their drinks on picnic blankets.Armed cops were spotted patrolling the event this morning, ahead of the arrivals of the Queen, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and other senior royals.However, officers were also on the look-out for any violence between drunken punters – with 300,000 expected to attend over the four-day festival - after violence marred previous meetings at the historic course.In May video footage emerged of a mass brawl, where topless men were seen throwing punches outside a bar at Ascot.While a week later another man was filmed being kicked in the head during a fight at Goodwood races in Sussex.Goodwood chiefs are so sick of the booze-fuelled unsavoury antics that they have limited punters to buying fours drinks one time.However, it is not thought that Ascot has taken similar measures.Thames Valley Police said racegoers should not be alarmed by their heavy presence.Assistant chief constable David Hardcastle said: Aside from our duties protecting the Royal party, the public have come to expect a strong security presence at prominent events and occasions.People should be reassured and not alarmed by the security measures that are being put in place.The public provide our additional eyes and ears and I ask them to support my officers and racecourse security by remaining vigilant, keeping their belongings with them and reporting anything suspicious or unusual to staff or by calling 101."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414474363-e1529406636182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dunkirk boat ww2 evacuation restored isle of wight","story":"The 40ft Caretta had already played a role in two wars by the time it was used to help rescue Allied troops from the beaches of Normandy in May and June 1940.Operation Dynamo saw 850 private boats save over 336,000 British and French soldiers who were facing annihilation by Adolf Hitler’s unstoppable German forces who had trapped them in the town.The vessels sailed from Ramsgate in Kent to rescue the troops during a brief halt in the German advance.Aircraft engineer Arron, 39 and 32-year-old Tina French knew little of the craft’s history when they snapped it up after spotting it on eBay.But after spending £1,000 on its restoration they discovered that it had also  served as a river patrol vessel in the Boer War and took part in the troop landings and evacuations at Gallipoli in the First World War.During the restoration Arron found 32 bullet holes in its hull from where it had been riddled with Turkish machine gun fire while grounding on the beach at Gallipoli.In more recent years Caretta was used by a marine biologist but after he died she ended up going to rot in a boatyard in Essex.It’s thought its remarkable history could see it sell for as much as £100,000 over its £60,000 estimate.Arron, from Ryde on the Isle Of Wight, said: We had been looking to buy a little classic boat as a restoration project.I saw Caretta on eBay. The advert didnt list all of her history, it just said she was a bit old and a bit special.It was only later that we discovered her true history.There cant be that many ships that served in three different wars that are still floating today.The Caretta was launched in 1898 as a small armed boat designed to protect British battleships and cruisers at anchor.She was sent to the Boer War as a river patrol boat and was then used in the First World War to land troops on the beaches in France before being sent to Gallipoli as a landing craft.The exact role of Caretta at Dunkirk is not known but there is a photograph of her being towed with about 16 other little ships down the River Thames towards the English Channel.Terry Woodcock, of Unique Auctions of Lincolnshire, which is selling the vessel, said: We have had a lot of interest in it already.”The sale takes place on June 24."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413616539.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"italy matteo salvini gypsy census roma question register","story":"Matteo Salvini, 45, who is the Federal Secretary of the country’s far right Northern League, said the measure would be done in a bid to expel any non-Italians.The former MEP, known as ‘Il Capitano’ told the TV station Telelombardia: Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we cant expel them.”Salvini, who heads the right wing, anti-immigration party added: Irregular [undocumented] foreigners will be deported via agreements with other countries.”He said the information would be used to form a “register” of the Roma or gypsy people as the current situation was “chaos”.Salvini said: “I’ve asked the ministry to prepare a dossier on the Roma question in Italy.”In a subsequent statement, Salvini said the government had no intention of setting up a separate archive for the Roma or taking finger prints, but wanted to protect Roma children who were barred from going to local schools by their parents.He added that he wanted to check how European Union funds aimed at helping marginalised communities were being spent.In a tweet, Salvini wrote: “Someone is talking about being shocked. Why? I am thinking of those poor children taught to steal and break laws.”He wrote on his Facebook page earlier today that I dont quit, and added he would put the Italians and their security first.It is not the first time Salvini has hit out at gypsies and has previously called for the camps to be bulldozed and claimed earlier this year the Roma people were “not happy unless they are stealing.”Salvinis comments drew an immediate barrage of criticism, with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) saying his call revived memories of ethnic cleansing.Roberto Malini, from the charity EveryOne Group, who campaign for minority group rights compared to the move to Nazi propaganda.He said: “These words, and the call for a register of gypsies, takes us back to the beginnings of Nazism.”Carlo Stasolla, of the July 21 Association, which supports Roma rights said: “The Interior Minister apparently doesn’t know that in Italy a census based on ethnic origin is not legal.”In the 13th and 14th centuries in the principalities of what was Moldavia and Wallachia they were classified as slaves.Spain conducted The Great Roundup of Romani in 1749 with the crown ordering a nationwide raid with able-bodied men interned in labour camps in an attempt of ethnic cleansing.Many European countries also followed a policy of forced assimilation with a number of measures including forcing boys into military service, forcing Roma to register with their local authority, banning marriages and even prohibiting wearing their traditional clothing or speaking their language.Norway in 1896 passed a law permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions with around 1,500 Roma children being removed from their parents.Persecution of the Roma worsened even further in Nazi Germany with gypsies subjected to genocide by Germany and its allies during World War 2, such as Benito Mussolini’s Italy.During the Romani Holocaust, known as Porajmos, gypsies were classified as “enemies of the race-based state” and rounded up and taken to the extermination camps.Along with the Jews, gypsies were also used as human subjects in often horrific experiments.The policy was extended to areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably Croatia, Romania and Hungary.Estimates vary as to how many Roma were victims of the Holocaust with numbers possibly exceeding one million.Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has estimated the figure to be between 220,000 and 500,000.Tens of thousands of Roma, live across Italy, many in squalid shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities.Malini estimated there were around 70,000 Italian Roma in the country with between 30-40,000 non-Italian Roma, mainly from Romania.The country has 30 official camps along with around 30 more that are unlicensed.Salvini is part of a new populist coalition government that is in power with the anti-euro Five Star party which has called for the closure of the unlicensed camps and for the Roma children whose parents do not send them to school to be taken into care.In this year’s general election no one party won an outright majority with both the League and the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, emerging as strong political forces as the country lurched away from Matteo Renzi’s centre-left coalition.With no party able to form a stable government there followed months of protracted negotiations to find a solution.The new government was finally sworn in on June 1 and has started pursuing a populist, right wing agenda.It has already promised to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and stopping boats carrying rescued migrants from docking in Italian ports.Salvini recently prevented the ship Aquarius which was carrying 629 migrants from landing in Italy, forcing it to eventually dock in Valencia, Spain."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000369942946.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"home office blasted for releasing 15 year old orphan back into the hands of traffickers","story":"In a damning court judgement it was declared that staff under the-then Home Secretary had failed the Vietnamese boy - who hasnt been seen for almost three years - by not putting in place measures to keep him safe.The Court of Appeal heard that the boy was found in the back of a lorry in Kent in September 2015 with fifteen other young men or boys - six of whom were Vietnamese.Immigration authorities thought he was over 18 and he was detained, with plans to return him to Vietnam.But he told lawyers that he was just 15 and indicated he had been trafficked to the UK via Russia.Lawyers demanded that a package of arrangements should be put in place before he was released which would stop him falling back into the hands of his traffickers.Lord Justice Underhill said he believed that the material before the Secretary of State plainly justified a credible suspicion as at November 6 2015 that the young man was a victim of trafficking and also that he was at risk of being re-trafficked if proper protective measures were not taken.Despite this, he gave them a release address and was allowed to leave a detention centre.Police said he was later seen with another man at Gatwick railway station -

and said they should have done more to protect him.The boy is believed to have been brought to the UK earlier that year by an agent, who approached him and told him he could earn more working abroad.But as payment for getting him to Britain, he would have to work - but he didnt know what the job was or for how long.Three other people who arrived with him have gone missing from care, and the whereabouts of others are unknown, and the lawyers acting on his behalf are concerned for his safety.The judge today said that the Home Office should look at the case and see whether any lessons could be learned from it.A Home Office spokesperson said of todays ruling.We are carefully considering this judgement.We are committed to doing everything possible to keep adults and children in our care safe, including those identified as potential victims of modern slavery.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The head was right at the bottom, so I didn’t see it at first.“I thought I could see the hint of a comb. And I just thought ‘oh god that’s not a chicken head is it?’“It was surreal. Then I saw its beak and eyes all still intact. It was almost stuck in this frozen silent scream.“With the beak open wide like that and it’s eye kind of looking at you, it made me feel sad.”Bonnie said she has still got the head in her fridge as she doesn’t know what to do with it.She added: “Obviously I know where meat comes from. That’s just the reality of it. But to have it right there in your face especially when I don’t eat meat is very confronting.“I gasped out loud when I saw it, and my son came running over to see what had happened.“He is a vegetarian by his own choice, and I really didn’t want him to see it as I know it would really scare him.“Luckily he didn’t see it as I hid it straight away. I’ve still got the chicken head sitting in the fridge.“I’m not sure what they wanted me to do with it or if I should take it back. But I know I won’t be buying chicken necks from Coles again.”A spokesman for Coles said: “Coles takes the quality of all our products seriously.

The bombs sank against the dam wall before exploding.The Möhne and Edersee Dams were breached causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley.Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and several more damaged. Factories and mines were also damaged and destroyed.An estimated 1,600 civilians - around 600 Germans and 1,000 mainly Soviet forced labourers - died."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004132975582-e1529084313308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rapport with her majesty gives meghan markle last laugh on critics","story":"Photos of her with the Queen this week showed the two of them getting along like a house on fire.It was clear Her Maj has a lot of time and affection for the newest member of the clan and she went out of her way to make Meghan feel at ease.It was very much a royal masterclass from the Queen to her young apprentice, and Meghan appeared to pass all of the tests with flying colours.It must have been intimidating for the newly minted Duchess to find herself carrying out a royal engagement for the first time with the woman she can now call “granny” without Harry by her side.There was a bit of a faux pas when the Queen had to briskly usher her grand-daughter-in-law into the limo when Meghan appeared to be unsure of ­protocol.The Queen then took her ­preferred seat behind the driver. These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However 37 per cent believe their fantasy car is nothing but a pipe dream and are resigned to NEVER possessing such a vehicle. But when it comes to their next motor, the 2,000 drivers surveyed are in no doubt about the dream features it would have – including a panoramic sunroof, heated seats and sat-nav. Assisted driving tech such as parking sensors, automatic braking systems and remote start would be important too.  And for one in 10, a cup holder would be an absolute must. A spokesperson for Hyundai said: “As the research shows, many of us long to own a truly amazing car but unfortunately a vast number don’t think they ever will. “Of course, this doesn’t stop us wondering what our dream car would – or will – be like and clearly we have pretty fixed ideas of what our next car would at least have.” Preferences also differ somewhat according to age with 18-24 year olds especially keen that their next car features tech such as Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Whereas those aged 48 plus are more concerned with features which improve safety and aid driving such as demisting mirrors, automatic braking systems and parking sensors.  Interestingly, men and women want very similar things when it comes to their next car – although the number one requirement for men is air conditioning while parking sensors are a must for females. The findings emerged as it was revealed 35 per cent of those polled buy the first car they go to see when shopping for a new motor. And around one fifth will only check out two vehicles before making a decision. The research also identified the factors we take into account when purchasing a new motor, with price at the top of the list. Factors such as reliability and fuel type are also popular among those polled, in addition to fuel economy and CO2 emissions.  On the flipside, it also emerged that there are certain things that annoy people about their current cars. The most common being scratches and dents, size, how much it costs to fill up with fuel and how slowly it accelerates. Others are fed-up with smelly air con, poor visibility out of the rear window and being unable to get the radio to work. Amid this, four in 10 have bought a car and regretted it later.  Carried out through OnePoll , the research also found the typical motorist has owned six cars to date with their first one costing \u0026pound1,596.10 on average.  In contrast, their current vehicle on average costed \u0026pound11,313.28.

Jamie Elliot was over the limit when he started driving the propelled vehicle with a passenger on board in the early hours of May 29.  A court heard how the 18-year-old had been out drinking when he took the golf buggy from the nearby Catterick Golf Club in North Yorkshire and attempted to take it into the drive-thru, which is over a mile away. The incident received widespread coverage after North Yorkshire Police posted a picture of the buggy and described it as the most unusual job of the night. Elliot admitted one count of driving while unfit through drink and was handed the 12-month driving ban and ordered to pay a total of \u0026pound235 in fines and court costs on Tuesday.  He was told that by magistrates in Northallerton that, should he complete a rehabilitation course by the end of January next year, the length of the ban would be reduced. Prosecutor Sarah Tyrer told the court how officers first arrived at the scene when they were informed by staff at the McDonald\u0027s that they had spotted Elliot in the buggy. Mr Elliot confirms that he had taken the golf buggy from the Catterick Golf Course, Ms Tyrer told the court. The prosecutor also claimed that the teenager would have had to have opened a secure shed in order to access the vehicle and had therefore been given a caution for taking without consent. When he was taken to a nearby police station, Elliot was breathalysed and gave a reading of 47 micrograms of alcohol for every 100 millilitres of breath, the legal limit being 35.

Legally, all prepackaged food must display nutritional information about the calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein and salt it contains. But we found that some values listed on products are based on tiny portion sizes that are a just small percentage of the full packet. The worst example we found was a 50g bag of flatbread thin bites at Aldi. The pack reads: “What a treat – just 13 calories per serving.”  But this is per crisp rather than the whole bag, which contains 260 calories, 20 times more than one crisp. Campaigners are calling on retailers to print clearer information on food labels. Martyn James, of the consumer website Resolver, said: “Misleading people about the health benefits of their food isn’t just a betrayal of trust, it’s potentially damaging their health.” The British Retail Consortium said: “Retailers use front of pack labelling to ensure consumers can make informed decisions.” So, how much of these foods should you be eating?  Pack size 70g Number of recommended servings 3 Calories per serving 143 Calories per pack 429  The same size as a bag of crisps, this triple-cooked pork crackling doesn’t seem that unhealthy at just 143 calories per serving and just 3.8g of saturated fat. But Mr Porky claims that the pack contains three servings, so total calories shoot up to 429 calories and 11.4g of saturated fat for the lot.  Innocent orange juice with bits Pack size 330ml  Number of recommended  servings 2.2  Calories per serving 59 Calories per pack 129  Watch for portion sizes when it comes to fruit juice. We shouldn’t be drinking more than 150ml of fruit juice a day due to the high sugar content, yet this small bottle contains over two servings and a total of 26.4g of sugar.  Rowntree’s Fruit Pastilles  Pack size 52.5g Number of recommended servings 2 (7 sweets per serving) Calories per serving 84 Calories per pack 188  Nestle says this pack contains two servings, but how many of us stop at just seven sweets? Sugar goes from 14.9g per serving to 29.8g per pack.  Asda pesto and sun-dried tomato pasta salad Pack size 250g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 293 Calories per pack 586  The front of the pack says it has 293 calories per portion, but eating the whole box accounts for nearly all of your lunchtime calories. The fat content goes from 18g to 36g with the full box.  Chicago Town stuffed crust sticky sweet cola bbq stuffed crust  Pack size 650g Number of recommended servings 4 Calories per serving 426 Calories per pack 1704  Before chomping down on the whole thing, you might want to examine the small print, as the label gives details for a quarter of the pizza.  Eating it all would exceed a woman’s daily calorie intake. Flatbread Thin bites, cheddar and black pepper Pack size 50g  Number of recommended  servings 20  Calories per serving 13 Calories per pack 260  The Aldi pack reads: “What a treat – just 13 calories per serving”. But this is per crisp, not the full bag, which contains 260 calories.  The Foodie Market Tropical Blend Pack size 70g  Number of recommended  servings 3  Calories per serving 83 Calories per pack 249  Another rather small portion size from Aldi.  A snack pot is designed to be eaten on the go, so why not print calorie content for the whole packet? Twix  Pack size 50g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 123 Calories per pack 246  Displayed on the front of the gold packaging is a box stating 123 calories.  Only if you bother to turn over to read the small print will you realise that is for just one finger, as manufacturer Mars claims there are two portions in each pack. Kellogg’s Bran Flakes Pack size 750g  Number of recommended  servings 25   Calories per  serving 108  Calories per average 100g serving 359  In reality, 30g of cereal won’t feed a child, let alone an adult. A more realistic breakfast portion size is closer to 100g.  So a serving more likely contains 14g of sugar, not the 4.2g that the front of the pack suggests. Waitrose 1 Milk chocolate bar Pack size 30g Number of recommended servings 6 Calories per serving 31 Calories per pack 186  The “pack contains six servings”, so one portion is a single square, which has 1.7g of sugar. The full bar has 10.2g of sugar.  Asda Fizzy cherry cola flavour bottles  Pack size 45g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 78 Calories per pack 156  Try telling a child that they can only eat half a bag of sweets. That’s what Asda recommends, and the info on the front of the pack is for a small portion.  Marmite oven baked cashews Pack size 90g  Number of recommended  servings 3   Calories per  serving 172  Calories per pack 516  This bag is supposed to contain three servings. The whole pack has more saturated fat than a Big Mac – 11.5g – or 2.3g per portion.  Smarties  Pack size 38g Number of recommended servings 2 (17 sweets) Calories per serving 96 Calories per pack 192  Another unrealistic portion size from Nestle, which suggests a serving is just 17 sweets – half the pack – or 12.9g of sugar. For those who can’t stop, the full tube contains 25.8g.  Heinz cream of tomato soup Pack size 400g Number of recommended servings 2 Calories per serving 102 Calories per pack 204 Again listed on the front are the nutritional values for just half of the tin despite an adult easily consuming it one sitting. And the whole tin would have you eating 19.4g of sugar compared to 9.7g per portion. Asda chocolate jumbo Swiss roll Pack size 400g  Number of recommended  servings 12  Calories per serving 135 Calories per pack 1620  Get your ruler out, as this is supposed to stretch to 12 servings.

Crews entered flat 16 on the fourth floor of the west London block by breaking down the door at about 1.07am on June 14 last year. Thermal imaging camera footage was played during a presentation by Professor Niamh Nic Daeid, the director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee, who was explaining the origins of the fire and its spread. Firefighters could be seen entering a smoke-clogged corridor and rooting through the flat, before a bright yellow glow can be seen in the kitchen.  The professor said: The yellow glow that you can see is the fire that is down at the window ledge in the kitchen. The firefighters attempted to put out the fire and we can see there the hose reel is attempting to put water on the fire.  They close the door and they open the door again to see that the fire is still present. At this point the firefighters spend some time discussing what tactics they can use to tackle the fire that is in the corner of the kitchen. They re-entered at 1.20am and extinguished the fire. However, embers could be seen falling from the tower\u0027s external facade at 1.08am, the expert said, and the blaze had started spreading from the kitchen window at 1.09am.  This is around five minutes before the firefighters entered the kitchen for the first time, she added. Firefighters can be seen spraying liquid at the fire, which was put out in the flat itself at 1.20am. A split-screen was used to show mobile phone footage of the flame beginning to spread up the outside of the building at the same time.

The man spent several hours on a roof on Saturday morning after residents spotted him looking in their first-floor windows. Once he made a break for it, the homeowner\u0027s son leaped over a six-foot fence and put the man in a headlock.  Other members of the community in Grimsby then marched him back to police, Grimsby Live reported.  Howard Clough said: My wife woke me up to tell me there was someone on our kitchen roof who had been trying the windows. We\u0027ve got some young kids so it was very worrying.  The man, who was described as in his late 20s, refused to come down from the ground-floor roof of the house even after the police arrived. Howard\u0027s son Liam and several other residents gathered around, but the man refused to budge. Residents believe the man had been on another roof on the street at 6am that morning, but that wasn\u0027t reported to police. Someone down the road saw him looking into bedrooms about 6am. One person\u0027s son asked his dad: Why is there a man looking in my window?\u0027 according to Mr Clough. The man\u0027s story allegedly constantly changed - at first, he told residents he was getting a football off the roof and later said he was being chased by six men and couldn\u0027t get down because he was scared. Police arrived on the scene shortly after being alerted to the incident.  We tried to keep him calm and talk him into getting down. One person kept offering him a lighter to persuade him, but he wouldn\u0027t do it, Howard said. After several hours, Howard\u0027s neighbour Lee lost patience and climbed out onto his own kitchen roof, which is connected to the other ones on the road. The man jumped down and started garden-hopping fences, pursued by the residents. My son Liam was the fastest - he managed to get to the end of the street, where the man had hopped over a six-foot fence. Liam jumped through a patch of the nettles without even looking, and vaulted straight over it after him, Howard said. We ran around and found Liam had got the man in a headlock. We were able to walk him back over to the police, who arrested him.

Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009, are known for such works as The Gates, a 2005 installation in New York\u0027s Central Park, and the wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin.

Loughborough Junction is an elevated station managed by Thameslink and located on a line between Herne Hill and Elephant and Castle stations. It is near three other lines used by trains which do not stop at the station. The area is said to be a graffiti hotspot - with its proximity to Brixton and a trend in youngsters to try and get their tag on tricky-to-reach spots along the railway line. Investigators believe the tragedy took place in the early hours and are working to identify which train struck the men.

That means in their tot\u0027s first 12 months, exhausted mums and dads will sleep 59 per cent less than the recommended eight hours a night, losing the equivalent of 50 nights of kip. It also emerged a typical parent spends 54 minutes per day trying to get their baby to sleep, adding up to almost 14 days in their first year. Furthermore mums and dads will also pace the equivalent of two miles while rocking their baby each day and night, totting up to 730 miles – the equivalent of 28 marathons – over a 365-day period. The study also found with the average new-born waking three times a night when they first arrive home, sleep deprivation can take an emotional toll on relationships.  More than two thirds of British parents believe they have got into arguments with their partner purely as a result of their baby’s poor sleep habits. Steve Reid, CEO and Co-Founder for sleep technology brand Simba, which commissioned the study, said: “As a new parent myself, the fallout from sleeplessness as a parent can be overwhelming and can push you to the limits, which is why we’ve been meticulous in crafting the new Simba Hybrid\u0026reg Cot Mattress. “Sleep nourishment, plays a vital role in the recuperation, growth, immune system, brain development and learning of a child and having put the cot mattress through rigorous independent testing, the results speak for themselves.  “Nine out of 10 babies fall asleep faster on a Simba, with three out of four sleeping longer too – gifting parents with a much-needed additional hour of sleep every night. “When your baby sleeps well, you sleep better and that sets everyone up for the day. Investing in the right mattress is just as important for babies as it is for adults.” The study also found 23 per cent of those polled believe the lost sleep in their child’s first year at home led them to behave \u0027slightly unusually\u0027.  In their sleep-deprived state, 11 per cent have hallucinated something which wasn’t really there, and 44 per cent have completely forgotten what they were saying mid-sentence. Eight per cent have even forgotten the name of their baby. Sixty-four per cent look back on their first year as parents and are \u0027amazed\u0027 they were able to function through it all as well as they did. In those early months, one third of new parents believe warm milk is the best remedy for settling a restless baby.  Thirty two per cent found their little one slept best when they were rocked to sleep in their arms, and one in five got their baby a comfort blanket to keep them cosy while they snoozed. Hope Bastine, resident psychologist for Simba said, “We spend hours poring over the nutritional value of food because we know it’s essential for baby’s development. But how often do we pause to consider the nutritional value of a well-balanced home?  “Sleep is an equally rich nutrient in a child’s formative years. And the ingredients of your nursery and getting it ‘night-right’ can mean the difference between a happy day and a grisly one.” Steve Reid added, “Testing has revealed the Simba Hybrid\u0026reg cot mattress is 400 per cent more supportive than other leading high street cot mattresses. “And with Simba babies waking on average once less each night, we’re also confident that your new-born will be getting quality slumber. “Everyone deserves the best night’s sleep. We’ve applied the same big thinking and Simba engineering prowess that people love, and re-imagined it for the smallest and most sensitive members of the family, ensuring bones and bodies are completely supported right from day one.” "},{"url":null,"title":"not football fan here how","story":"AdvertorialNot a football fan? Here is how best to AVOID the tournament currently all over your TVHere are some suggestions for the best places in the UK to get away from it all\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Masters16:00, 19 JUN 2018Updated16:29, 19 JUN 2018Advertorial (Image: Getty Images South America)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOver the next month, there\u0027s a lot of football to endure if you\u0027re not a fan. THAT tournament in Russia which is dominating the airwaves will see 32 teams take part in 64 matches over the course of more than a month. That\u0027s a lot of joy if you love the sport… and a lot of matches to avoid if you don\u0027t. But let\u0027s not complain or grumble - let’s see this as an opportunity instead. For those who don’t love football, the international tournament presents the perfect chance to sample the lovely and amazing things on offer right here in the UK. Avoid: 24 June, England vs Panama  Unlike England’s opening match against Tunisia, their second match is at the weekend on a Sunday afternoon. This of course means excitement will be at fever pitch and the country will be talking about little else. For someone with less interest in football, that means escape will be necessary. And the spectacular beauty of the Lake District could be the solution - it gives you soul-nourishing views and less chance of having to watch a football match.  We recommend Scafell Pike in Cumbria. It\u0027s the highest mountain in England at 978m above sea level and an area of unbelievable beauty with countless campsites and other places to stay. We can\u0027t promise you\u0027ll avoid the football entirely, but there\u0027s a fair bet you can if you want to. Ideal for hiking, canoeing and climbing there\u0027s loads to do in the Lake District and lots of beauty to see. It\u0027s worth doing some water-based activities in the lake at the foot of Scafell Pike - it\u0027s England\u0027s deepest lake at 258 feet.  Mind you, it\u0027s dwarfed by the depth of Lock Morar in Scotland, which is 1,017 feet deep. It\u0027s worth mentioning that the deepest a human has dived in scuba gear is 1,090 feet! See, you\u0027ve already forgotten about the football and you haven\u0027t been yet...  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Aerobie Squidgie Disc , \u0026pound5.50, for a non-football activity to keep the family entertained. For camping you can’t beat the Halfords Vis a Vis Tent which is now \u0026pound60, was \u0026pound150 (save \u0026pound90). It\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends, with two separate bedrooms and a living area which provides some extra space for your essential kit.  Avoid: 28 June, England vs Belgium  Instead of sitting through England’s final group game, why not visit Wales instead? After all, the Welsh aren\u0027t in the tournament this time around, so they\u0027re likely to be as keen to ignore it as you. We specifically love the village of Llanwddyn, below, which, in the 1880s, was forever submerged when a new reservoir was created in the Vyrnwy valley. The purpose of Lake Vyrnwy was to supply Liverpool with fresh water, which is something it still does to this day. It\u0027s also a nature reserve and offers amazing access to nature - perfect for a picnic.  Look out for the gothic straining tower, which filters the water before it heads off toward Liverpool. There are also a number of RSPB hides around the lake, from which you can spot some of the birds which inhabit the area. You\u0027ll also find loads of excellent picnic spots to watch the world go by. A road runs around the perimeter of the reservoir too, which is often used by runners and could easily be great for a family bike ride, if everyone is confident on the road.   Don\u0027t forget to take: Picnics are a lot better when you’re comfortable, so grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket for everyone to sit on - now half price at \u0026pound10. Remember to take the Plastic Plates , Bowls , Plastic Set of Tumblers and Cutlery – all half price at \u0026pound3 each.    If you’re interested in cycling the road, the Carrera Parva Hybrid Bike will see you up even the toughest of hills, thanks to its larger 27.5 wheels and 21 speed Shimano Tourney gears. It\u0027s available in both men and women ’s configurations and is only \u0026pound210 (save \u0026pound90).    For the kids, good choices are the Apollo Kinx Junior Hybrid Bike ,  which has a cool floral design- or the racer red Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike . Both are currently reduced to just \u0026pound104 (was \u0026pound130, save \u0026pound26) and the Shimano 18 speed gears will let them fearlessly tackle every hill they encounter.  Avoid: 2 \u0026amp 3 July, potential England game in Last 16  Should England qualify from the group stage and make it to the knockout stage of the competition, this is where the wall-to-wall football coverage will go into overdrive, making it nigh on impossible to avoid discussion of England’s prospects. Instead, perhaps you should consider some of England\u0027s amazingly beautiful woodland.  Swinley Forest in Berkshire contains a set of exciting mountain bike trails that are fun for the whole family. There are three routes in total: a green for beginners, blue for more advanced cyclists and a red for proficient mountain bikers. It\u0027s the ideal day out for anyone who likes cycling more than football. An adventure playground and spaces to build your own fort finish off this ideal location for family fun.  Don\u0027t forget to take: Make the most of the Swinley Forest mountain bike trails on the Carrera Sulcata Mountain Bike - available for both men and women now \u0026pound340, was \u0026pound425 (save \u0026pound85). A hefty cycle offroad is going to make you really ready for a hearty lunch.   The kids will have no trouble keeping up on the Carrera Blast Junior Mountain Bike , \u0026pound260. It\u0027s a great choice for kids graduating up to their first mountain bike, with its lightweight junior fit Carrera alloy frame for a light and easy ride.   Alternatively, the Carrera Luna Junior Mountain Bike with 24 wheel is \u0026pound232, (was \u0026pound290, save \u0026pound58). It has a lightweight frame with 21 speed gears and a Suntour Alloy M3020 suspension fork to help take on all terrains.  Avoid: 6 \u0026amp 7 July, quarter-finals  Many experts expect England to reach the last eight of the tournament, which would make this their biggest match of the competition - and an excuse for a national festival of football. If that’s not for you, down in Cornwall, below, there are plenty of places to enjoy the outdoors, and specifically the beach. Usually free of TVs and thus the football, these beaches are a haven for the non-sports-fan, and the soft sand and crashing waves make it the ideal place to swim during the day and barbecue a little later.  Check before you light the charcoal but many Cornish beaches allow non-gas barbecues, as long as they are raised off the ground on legs. It\u0027s also often a requirement that you wait until the early evening to light up, so as not to annoy day visitors. Be considerate with the cooking and remember to take any mess home with you.  Some beaches allow cold ashes to be placed in a rubbish bag next to a bin, but please check with the council first.  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Halfords Briefcase BBQ , above, is the ideal companion for this trip and is currently half price at \u0026pound7.50. It folds up into a compact, convenient unit that will cook up more than enough food for a small family. Keep your sausages and pork pies beautifully cool in the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox , at just \u0026pound85, was \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound25).  Avoid: 10 \u0026amp 11 July, semi finals  If England reach this stage, the country will be officially consumed by football fever. Like the Welsh, Scotland\u0027s national football team also didn\u0027t qualify this year. Therefore it\u0027s quite likely that avoiding it will be a lot easier north of Hadrian’s Wall. It\u0027s hard to imagine a place more relaxing than the Scottish Highlands. The best thing to do is enjoy the sights and play some games. Go armed with a frisbee and bundles of energy and you’ll have an amazing time breathing in clean, football-free air.  From camping to log cabins, there\u0027s loads of places to stay and countless walks, bike rides and distillery tours (there are eight in the area) to take.

One year on from the tower block tragedy, more than 300 leaseholders at Vallea Court and Cypress Place in the Green Quarter, Manchester, have been arguing their case at a tribunal. Their freeholder, the investor Pemberstone, has issued them with a demand for \u0026pound3m out of the blue. That was the result of investigations carried out in the wake of the London blaze, which found the same dangerously flammable material had been used on their blocks. After the leaseholders refused to pay, Pemberstone launched legal action against them - which saw residents crowd-fund enough money to pay for legal advice, but still unable to fund a lawyer for the hearing. Fran Reddington, 33, says the community has had no help from the council, the mayor’s office, the government or anyone else, adding that they have effectively been left to fend for themselves.  “The hardest thing for us is that we have not really had any support from anybody,” she said. “We got the official letters from the management company but then we got hit by these notices and we didn’t really know what to do. “Luckily we have got quite a strong community and set up this Facebook group to see what we could do together. So that’s how we got the crowdfunding.  We didn’t have the option of a lawyer though and just had to fight for ourselves. “It’s so stressful and we’ve just been left. The worst thing is that we’re just being ignored.” The two Green Quarter blocks, which are managed by Living City, were built by international development giant Lend Lease. In recent years the freehold has been sold on to Pemberstone, a property investment giant that owns residential and commercial buildings across the country, which argues that under the terms of their leases the residents should pay for any remedial works themselves.  However a copy of one introduction letter sent by Lend Lease to a purchaser - who had bought their flat directly from them - states that ‘Lend Lease will undertake, at our expense, to complete any accepted defect that has arisen as a result of either faulty materials or defective workmanship’. Nevertheless while the buildings are understood to still be under warranty, residents have so far also been unable to claim costs for removing and replacing the cladding through insurance - and they say Lend Lease has been silent on the issue. Residents have also noted that the developer, states in its corporate vision that ‘companies must start justifying their worth to society, with greater emphasis placed on environmental and social impact rather than straight economics’. Marketing consultant Katie Kelly bought her flat from the developer four years ago. “Not only are big businesses failing to do the right thing, they are happily putting over 300 people’s lives at risk,” she said.  “The way the whole situation has been handled, from taking us to a tribunal which we will likely have to pay for, to taking over a year to even begin work to make our homes safe, is crazy.   “I can’t understand how nobody from these businesses feels responsible.”  Leaseholders say they have no idea what will happen if they lose the tribunal and are left literally unable to pay the money. Lucy Powell, MP for next-door Manchester Central, has been dealing with a number of such cases in the city over the past year, including a similar dispute at the Chips building in New Islington. A few weeks ago housing minister Dominic Raab responded to an inquiry from her on the issue, reiterating that private sector companies should ‘do the right thing’ and not pass the costs on to leaseholders. However his letter does not outline any government plans to force the hand of those who will not, adding that ministers are keeping the situation ‘under review’.  Lucy Powell said that one year on from Grenfell blaze, on June 14 last year, the government’s position was ‘not good enough’. “I have been helping lots of residents who are concerned about fire safety – particularly in private blocks, she added. “In many cases they are also worried about being forced to pay huge sums to make their buildings safe. “In a recent reply I received from the government I was told that the government were urging companies not to pass costs on to leaseholders but this is not good enough.  “People who bought their homes in good faith now find that they may not be safe and on top of their worries, they are often being asked to pay large sums of money to put that right.” One year on, the government is ‘nowhere near’ sorting out the implications of Grenfell for the private housing sector, she added. The tribunal is expected to take around six weeks to report back.  A spokesperson for Pemberstone said: “The tribunal is a well established forum to which either landlords or leaseholders can apply to establish clarity on an issue that affects the management of a residential building and its service charge.  “Tribunals are independent and are widely used within the residential property sector. They are particularly appropriate for large schemes like this where there are 345 apartment owners, some of whom are investors located overseas.   “We believe an independent decision from a tribunal would be in the best interests for all concerned and should allow us to establish a clear way forward.  “Our property managers Livingcity are in regular contact with apartment owners and have been providing regular updates.  “Over the past year they have sent out nine letters to all leaseholders explaining the latest position and have issued responses to at least 78 individual enquiries.  “They have an office on site and a web portal on which they post information.  “They also hold regular residents’ meetings including one in February attended by over 100 individuals.

Punters posed for the cameras with ladies dressed in floral outfits and brightly coloured fascinators and gents sporting top hats and elegant suits. Many faced breathalyser tests and bag searches as organisers seek to clamp down on anti-social behaviour this year. There has also been a crackdown on beer sales and an increased stewarding presence. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen at the huge sporting event from 2pm and will later present the winning trophy for the St James\u0027 Palace Stakes at 4.20pm.  Royal Ascot 2018 LIVE results: Prince Harry and Megan Markle visit plus news, tips, schedule and full racecard       The couple waved to the crowd as they were seen arriving on the royal carriage procession alongside Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The Queen headed up the procession, standing out in a buttercup yellow coat dress, alongside daughter Princess Anne in blush pink. The Duchess wore a white Givenchy dress for her racing debut - Clare Waight Keller of the French fashion house designed her wedding gown - with a monochrome Philip Treacy hat.  They also joined the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla and Princess Anne at the annual event - but Kate and Wills - who recently welcomed their third child - were absent. Ahead of the big race at 3.40pm racegoers poured into the venue dressed to the nines. Kelly Brooke was among the crowd, sporting a football themed hat from Ladbrokes to celebrate England’s football hopes.  The star of the bookmaker’s latest racing ad campaign, says: “I really want to show my support for the Three Lions and by wearing this gorgeous Ladbrokes hat designed by Ilda Di Vico, I think I have done just that.” The hat features a Bobby Moore figure holding aloft a Jules Rimet trophy and was designed by milliner Ilda Di Vico. Sir Cliff Richard was also seen among the celebrity stars at this year\u0027s racing spectacle - showing off in a grey suit and top hat. Among a host of other celebrities at the races were ex-WAG Lizzie, 48, who rocked a white feathered number and lace dress and former glamour model Jackie St Clair, 54, worked a floral theme.  Good Morning Britain\u0027s Kate Garraway rocked a fitted trouser suit, which she combined with a dramatic hat, while co-star Charlotte Hawkins won the fashion race in a 1950s-style green number, which was enhanced with a black, netted beret. Royal Ascot is renowned for its strict dress code and this year men must wear socks or risk being turned away from the famous race meet which is one of the highlights of the social calendar. With the UK having enjoyed good weather in the past few months the fashion for wearing shoes without socks may have crept into Royal Ascot.  This year\u0027s visitors sported an array of fashionable outfits - with ladies arriving in pastel pencil dress, brightly coloured stripy skirts and even a four of diamonds inspired dress. Rupert Adams from William Hill said: Ascot have tightened up the dress code for the royal meeting and many of the millennial generation might not even own socks. Punters traditionally have a bet on the colour of the Queen\u0027s hat with blue the favourite with bookies at the moment for the first day.  Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: Punters reckon Her Majesty will opt for a trusty shade of blue on the opening day of the Royal meeting. Last year there was a massive gamble on the Queen wearing blue as she wore blue to the state opening of Parliament before travelling to Royal Ascot, but she changed into another coloured outfit for the race meet. The Queen spoke about her fondness for Royal Ascot in her foreword for the official programme: My family and I greatly look forward to Royal Ascot.  As the royal meeting has evolved in recent times, it remains one of Britain\u0027s finest sporting occasions with 300,000 racegoers enjoying the unique heritage of Royal Ascot every year, and many more people watching at home. Tradition and innovation sit comfortably together, over five days of racing. International competition is a compelling feature in the modern era, and it is always a delight to welcome horses and jockeys from around the world to this wonderful racecourse.

Harvard researcher Matthew Sachs came to the conclusion after combining the results of his experiment with that of existing studies into the same subject. Sachs monitored the heart rates and skin conductance of subjects who listened to three of their favourite pieces of music. Intensity of lyrics, rising pitch, harmonic intervals and collective crowd singing emerged as the key factors in delivering the shivers.  Using the information Sachs created an equation: Pgoosebumps = CF (Sc + Id+Ap). CF recognises the cognitive factors and Sc is the social and environmental context such as the collective experience. Id stands for the individual differences such as the engagement with the music and Ap is the music’s acoustic properties, or the rapid increase or decrease in volume. Pgoosebumps is the percentage chance of getting goosebumps.  Sachs’ study was carried out to mark the launch of Barclaycard’s Entertainment partnership with Live Nation, which sees sponsorship of eight festivals across the summer and exclusive event perks for cardholders including 10 per cent back on festival pre-sales and many other benefits. Sachs said: Many studies have attempted to investigate what causes the emotion we feel while listening to music, but these have typically taken place in a lab setting. We’ve never before been able to explore how multiple factors influence the likelihood of experiencing goosebumps in a real-world context.  It’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the physiological correlates of aesthetic emotions for the first time during live performances this summer.” Barclaycard also carried out a survey to accompany the study. The results show seven in 10 Brits think goosebumps are a marker of great live entertainment, but only 16 per cent of us understand where the physiological phenomenon comes from. But the majority of Brits (71 per cent) think getting goosebumps is the top sign of a great live entertainment experience. It also emerged the emotional effect of a live music experience is also enhanced by being among friends (41 per cent), singing along with the crowd (41 per cent) and watching your favourite artist perform (40 per cent). The research also revealed while 71 per cent of Brits have experienced the chills during live entertainment, 13 per cent incorrectly believe that romantic attraction is actually the key cause of goosebumps – with almost one in 10 putting the sensation down to simply feeling cold (nine per cent).  Although 60 per cent of Brits associate goosebumps with the feeling of excitement, the new theory suggests that a personal relevance to the song, collective crowd experience and a rapid increase or decrease in volume are more important when it comes to delivering the shivers. Time of day is also a significant factor, with over half (56 per cent) of respondents feeling more goosebumps after 5pm than at any other time during a live music performance, with the optimum time for a goosebump moment identified as 6.37pm. Rock music was voted the genre most expected to cause goosebumps (31 per cent), followed by pop (29 per cent) and Indie (seven per cent). House tunes (six per cent) and classical symphonies (five per cent) complete the top five.  What’s more, Brits believe that watching their favourite band perform (28 per cent) is more likely to deliver the shivers than getting married (27 per cent), with only the sight of their new born child expected to create a greater goosebump-inducing moment (40 per cent). And it appears old flames burn the brightest for Brits, as over a tenth of respondents admit their most treasured memory of a great live music experience includes their ex or someone they used to date (11 per cent). Die-hard fans don’t need anyone by their side, with five per cent enjoying their best live music experience while on their own. Daniel Mathieson of Barclaycard, said: “Most people can identify with getting the chills while enjoying live entertainment, but very few actually understand the theory behind it. In just the first phase of our study, our goosebumps theory will finally provide some understanding of what causes the incredible phenomenon and makes live music so captivating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman left incurable leg condition","story":"NewsWoman left with incurable leg condition where one leg swells twice the size of other after cancer ordealCalley Bingham is learning to live with an incurable leg condition after undergoing treatment for cancer\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByClaire Violette HerbauxStewart Carr11:19, 19 JUN 2018Updated11:23, 19 JUN 2018NewsCalley Bingham was diagnosed with cervical cancer at just 25 (Image: Somerset Live WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young woman who survived cancer after being diagnosed at 25 has been left with a incurable leg condition. Calley Bingham was diagnosed with cervical cancer just four months after giving birth to her third child. After a long ordeal of surgery and therapies, Calley, now aged 27, overcame cancer but she has been left with lymphoedema, a condition where one of her legs swells up to almost twice the size of the other. Lymphoedema affects around 200,000 people in the UK, and Calley is determined to provide support through her new charity.   How to avoid deep vein thrombosis on a long flight - and other issues you face on a plane   The young woman from Meare, near Glastonbury, told Somerset Live : When I was diagnosed with cervical cancer my world fell apart. In the very beginning we all held our breath and prayed.  At a stage 1B2 - I was cureable. I underwent a 7.5 hour operation to remove my womb, cervix, fallopian tubes and part of my vagina and my pelvic lymph nodes. Then I had to go through six weeks of chemo-radiation and two lots of brachytherapy. I was grateful to be alive.   Mum sues hospital after waking up with permanent breast implants after her double mastectomy  I knew all this could cause lymphoedema, but there was no guarantee and I guess, like everyone else, you just assume it won\u0027t be you it happens to, or hope, at least. It started off with mild swelling but got worse. I was diagnosed with lymphoedema in my inner thigh in January last year and there is no chance of a cure. My experience with the condition has been painful - physically and mentally draining. It has changed the way I see myself and others see me. It changed the clothes and shoes I can wear and the amount of exercise I\u0027m able to do. The only treatment available includes Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) massage, which she travels to Taunton for weekly, and compression stockings, which she has to wear every day.   Mum \u0027too ashamed to go outside\u0027 after her eyes swelled shut after eyebrow tint  Having two legs completely different sizes brings about day-to-day problems for the young mum, especially as retailers don\u0027t cater for people with this or similar condition. Calley explains how shopping for clothes has become difficult: In the year and a half that I have had lymphoedema, my leg and foot have nearly doubled in size. Currently I carry four litres more fluid in my left leg and it is 40 per cent bigger than my right. Bandaging to reduce the size of my leg was unsuccessful and I have now been put forward for lymph assist treatment. One of the biggest things for me is that I couldn\u0027t just buy some Nikes or something young and in fashion to wear. Retailers don\u0027t provide odd pairs. The only shoes I am able to find that are comfortable and fit are more suitable for older people to be honest. I got in contact with Nike and various other shoe brands only to be told they didn\u0027t have a procedure to sell me a pair of odd shoes. Clarks said they did sell odd pairs but I\u0027d have to pay more than standard price. And again their styles aren\u0027t ones I would pick. I feel like people stare enough. I tend to wear leggings or stretchy jeggings as they stretch over the big leg, but I am having issues with them so my mum is making me lighter clothes for the summer.

Irina Chigirinskaya donned a designer wedding dress with lace and precious stones, estimated to have cost \u0026pound165,000, for the ceremony. A famous singer performed at the occasion, while the meals for Irina\u0027s 1,500 guests are said to have cost more than \u0026pound350,000.  The 18-year-old, who once mistook actor Robert De Niro for a waiter, wed her groom Moris Mirelli, 23, at a golf club in Russia.  She is the daughter of construction tycoon Alexander Chigirinsky, a friend of billionaire Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.  Her new husband is the son of a former deputy governor in Russia’s northern Arkhangelsk region. After the couple tied the knot, Irina was pictured posing in her stunning gown, by Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad. The spectacular Jewish-style wedding near Moscow was reported to be more expensive than Irina\u0027s elder sister Maria’s in 2015. It was held at a golf club owned by Crocus Group, headed by oligarch Aras Agalarov, a friend of US President Donald Trump.  Agalarov’s son Emin, a famous Russian singer, performed at the wedding, while guests reportedly indulged in salmon carpaccio. “Guests were treated to salmon carpaccio, all kinds of fish, Uzbek pilaf, shish kebab, Iranian apricots, fresh berries and cake, according to one account. “Bottles of chilled French champagne did not have time to end, as new ones appeared on the table.” The occasion is estimated to have cost a massive \u0026pound1.2 million. Irina is famous for admitting to terrible shock when - after a childhood of flying on private jets - she realised \u0027ordinary\u0027 people were sharing her plane on her first experience going economy class.  Explaining the \u0027horrors\u0027 of mass travel, she wrote on Instagram: \u0027I entered a plane and saw that there were a lot of people. “And I asked the stewardess out loud: ‘And what, all these people will fly with us?’” She claimed she had never “risked so much” in her life. Reports said the teenager could not even imagine that onboard, in addition to her family and friends, strangers might be flying too. Irina, who said she was 14 at the time, later deleted the entry.  The bride, from Russia’s superrich and highly privileged ‘golden youth’, also previously asked De Niro to bring her some water after mistaking him for a waiter. “I was nine or ten, everybody was smoking and that is why I got confused,” she said. “He told me that it\u0027s not hard to bring me some water.” Reports in Russia claim the teenager also posted previously about her handbags costing almost \u0026pound6,000 on social media.

He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

It’s a phrase to alert the teachers.”The father-of-two believes the needles fell out of wheelie bin which was lying on its side next to the paraphernalia.He spoke to his children, daughter Kiyann, 12, and Kelvin, to warn them about the needles and waited for council staff to come and safely dispose of them.Graeme, who works for Scotmid, said: “I think one of the bins had blown over, and there were about 30-odd needles lying on the ground. Children were coming out of school around 4pm, and there are three schools near here so a few kids walk past.\u0026#8220I waited and told any children coming past to go on to the pavement on the other side, as the needles were also on the road itself.”Gregor Murray, the council’s education convener, said: “The children were involved in an environmental project to clean-up the area around the school.“The ‘cookies and cream’ phrase was something they were told to shout out if they found anything like needles, broken glass or other hazardous things. I welcome anything like this schools are doing to make the children safe.”David Baxter, Dundee branch secretary of teaching union the Education Institute of Scotland, welcomed the procedure, saying: “The teachers’ objective is to keep children safe and I think, in Dundee, they do a really good job of that.

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116213.jpg","title":"Chelsie is delighted with her pageant debut","story":"\u0026nbspMISS Scotland finalist Chelsie Allison says she remains proud of her achievement, despite being pipped to the title at the final hurdle.The social work student, from Kirkhill, finished just a point behind winner Linzi McClelland at Friday\u0027 showpiece event.Chelsie (20), who was taking part in her first-ever pageant, said she loved the experience and now has her sights set on returning for another shot at the crown.\"I am very proud of how well I did,\" she said.\"There was only one point between myself and Linzi so that was quite frustrating, just because it was so close.\"I didn\u0026rsquot even think I would get as far as I did.\"It was the first pageant-type event I had ever done and I really enjoyed it.\"I thought it would be quite stressful but it wasn\u0026rsquot at all like that.\"You don\u0026rsquot really have any time to think about that, which is probably a good thing.\"As soon as the show started it was just go, go, go.\"The organisers have already asked me to go back again in the future and that\u0027 something I\u0026rsquod be really keen to do.\"The top three girls get to go for a photoshoot with some of the sponsors.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here

way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August.

That’s why it’s so important that we ensure they understand the strength of feeling in Aberdeen.”The protest will start at 6.30pm, at the Queen’s Road entrance to Rubislaw Quarry.A decision will be made on Thursday at 10am in the Town House.A Carttera spokeswoman previously said the new development would “breathe life” into the area.She said: “Aberdeen is currently at a crossroads with oil investment but with the new football stadium, AWPR, Nigg Harbour, the Music Hall refurbishment, Art Gallery extension and new AECC, the city is already taking bold steps to invest for future generations.“Approval of this development would be another significant and complementary contribution towards that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/35721710_958182864386268_4797971862590062592_o-851x564.jpg ","title":"images show behind the scenes at aberdeen air traffic control","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew images taken by staff at Aberdeen\u0026#8217s air traffic control have been shared online.The series of pictures shared by the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) on Facebook give a rare glimpse at the technology required to monitor all planes and helicopters flying in the north-east.Inside the tower, two images show the banks of screens and desks air traffic controllers would use to monitor the region\u0026#8217s airspace.Other images show helicopters parked up outside at the airport.And a final image shows the view from the top of the control tower over Aberdeen\u0026#8217s airfield late at night.The images were shared on Facebook as part of NATS #TowerTuesday project.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Here are some amazing shots taken from our NATS employees in Aberdeen #TowerTuesday ✈️Posted by NATS on\u0026nbspTuesday, 19 June 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"photographer uses 113 year old camera to capture poignant images of north east lifeboat crews","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA photographer aiming to create an archive gallery of every lifeboat station in the UK has made his way to the north-east.Jack Lowe\u0026#8217s Lifeboat Station Project is an attempt to photograph all of the 238 lifeboat stations in Britain.Last week he made his way to the north-east, visiting Macduff, Fraserburgh and Buckie.As well as using modern cameras, Jack has also been photographing each location using an 113-year-old camera.The vintage camera uses glass plates, rather than film, to keep the image.The glass plate is then processed \u0026#8211 with the result shown below.Describing the image, photographer Jack Lowe said: \u0026#8220Certainly one of the most poignant crew photographs I’ve made so far — the RNLI Fraserburgh volunteers on Thursday with their statue, a memorial to the three major disasters suffered at this lifeboat station.\u0026#8221The same process was used to capture this image of the Macduff lifeboat crew unloading their boat from the back of a flatbed truck.Jack has been travelling across the UK in a refurbished ambulance \u0026#8211 which also doubles as his dark room \u0026#8211 with the aim of photographing every lifeboat station in the country.Fraserburgh was his 106th lifeboat station.He said: “For a trip like this to work, I think you need a map, a story and an interesting vehicle – I purchased my ambulance on eBay after another buyer fell through.“I have had a passion for photography and lifeboats since I was eight-years-old and, after wanting a mid-life change in direction, I came up with the idea to photograph all of the 238 stations.“The Lifeboat Station Project is one of the largest of its kind and I hope to do a full exhibition of all the images once it’s complete.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meek cards albatross to move into the hunt at royal aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMost of us could not dream of hitting two irons to a par five green – but Canadian Sam Meek’s second shot on the sixth at Royal Aberdeen found the cup.The University of Nevada student’s albatross was the talk of the historic city course, which is main host of this week’s Amateur Championship.Meek teed off on the 487-yard hole with a four iron and only knew something special had happened with his 240-yard five-iron approach when spectators around the green started shouting and clapping.Meek, 19, eventually finished with a two-under 69, leaving him right in the thick of things.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Along the way she meets a gruff innkeeper played by The Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson, who could offer another chance for love.Locals to Argyll will spot The George Hotel as Lord Howard Awd’s (played by Craig Ferguson) Inn that Annabelle takes refuge in when she falls for the Scottish landscape. They may also spot Lochgilphead’s Argyll Street, which was packed with trucks on Wednesday June 13 for filming, and Icon Hairdressing which was the setting for another scene.To get into the mood for the movie, listen to Kathie Lee Gifford’s single \u0026#8216Love Me To Death\u0026#8217 which is now available on iTunes.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters week 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 16/06/18, 5:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe Now[Usual Science Matters logo]The battle for survival between native red and invasive grey squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ban smoking outside cafes could","story":"NewsBan on smoking outside cafes could be ditchedSouth Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:10, 18 JUN 2018NewsNino and Karen Pajovic, owners of Cafe Le Monde, have received much public support (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA law banning smoking outside cafes could be binned within weeks. South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12699200.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS153590781.jpg","title":"new arrivals bring light parents","story":"NewsNew arrivals bring a light to parents\u0027 livesWe wish all the best to the new happy families, and any other recent newborns.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:42, 13 JUN 2018NewsNew arrivals\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA number of new arrivals have been welcomed to Ayrshire.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton.

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm -

Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

to using the new route in the future.\nMelrose Festival chairman Douglas Hardie told us: \"A lot of riders came back saying how much they enjoyed the new route and how they would like to do it all

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.

The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport.

The team behind Haddington 700 is looking to create an unofficial world record and get 700 people dancing the Slosh on Saturday at 2pm.  The dance \u0026ndash made famous by Daniel Boone\u0026rsquos Beautiful Sunday \u0026ndash is regularly performed at weddings and parties. Now hundreds of people are expected to line up on Court Street for their own version.  Dozens of events are being held throughout 2018 to mark 700 years since the Bruce Charter \u0026ndash the oldest document in East Lothian archives.  Ruth Fyfe, archivist at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre, said: \u0026ldquoIt all came about last year when we were discussing things to do for Haddington 700. Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music. Instead, they can now welcome all-comers, with an instructional video already on the group\u0026rsquos Facebook page to get revellers in the mood."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7929938.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"North Berwick High School students taking play to the Highlands","story":"              MEMBERS of the Indelible Arts Youth Theatre are heading to the Highlands for the final of a national competition this weekend.  They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Comment   Let s wipe away the tears and rebuild our beloved Mack ","story":"              LIKE so many Glaswegians, on Friday night I found myself wiping away tears as fire engulfed the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art for the second time in four years.  I have a strong and very personal and relationship with this wonderful, magical, beautiful building. Over the years I\u0026rsquove seen countless exhibitions at the Mack, done various evening classes, danced and laughed with friends. I\u0026rsquove stood quietly and been bowled over again and again by its sheer elegance and practicality.  And by Saturday the initial sadness I felt turned to anger. How for the love of God could this happen again? How could four years of painstaking research and restoration by hundreds of craftspeople, the rebuilding of the peerless library, the ambitious plan to give every first year student at GSA a chance to study in the Mack, to live and breath its inspiration, have gone up in smoke?  Who or what was responsible for starting the fire and why did it take and spread so quickly? Were there not procedures in place to prevent this inconceivably grim turn of events?  We must be rigorous and ruthless in uncovering answers to all these questions and more in the months to come. In the aftermath of the 2014 fire, such inquiries were overshadowed by the outpouring of goodwill around restoration. This will not be the case this time around, and nor should it be. The people of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond deserve answers, not least because we gave so willingly and generously of our money to fund the restoration that now lies in ruins in Renfrew Street.  Once the fire service has produced its report into the cause of the blaze, a full public inquiry may be the only way to establish where responsibility lies and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  But another, even more difficult question will soon need attention: what now for the Mack? It is painfully early days, of course, and since we don\u0026rsquot yet know the exact extent of the damage, or how viable the shell of the building may or may not be, at present thinking about the future just makes your head hurt.  But since this building has always been a place of ideas, creativity and ingenuity, I\u0026rsquom trying my damnedest to focus on the positives.  Firstly, the building is not, as some are suggesting, \u0026ldquogone. I went to see what remains twice at the weekend and grim as the experience was, what struck me was the fact that the once beautiful west gable, arguably the finest architectural aspect in Scotland, is still recognisable, as is the iconic front elevation.  Secondly, thanks to an innovative project started after the first fire in 2014, the entire building has been digitised to within a millimetre of its life, both inside and out. In this respect at least The Mack still exists in its full glory, making the experience of the teams that worked on the now destroyed restoration invaluable rather than wasted. We should also remember that many of the surviving fixtures and fittings from the 2014 fire are still in storage.  It will be possible to rebuild the Mack from scratch if that\u0026rsquos what it takes. We should take heart from the Frauenkirche in Dresden, rebuilt after German reunification over 10 years starting in 1994 after it was completely destroyed during World War Two. The miracle rebirth of this beautiful church is now part of its story, something that makes it even more interesting to visitors. Think, too, of the chamber of the House of Commons, totally rebuilt after being razed on the final day of the Blitz in 1941.  The Mack arguably exceeds either of these two buildings in terms of architectural and cultural importance. Its place in the hearts and imaginations of Glaswegians, meanwhile, simply cannot be overstated.  Yes, the cost of rebuilding from scratch would be astronomical - quite possibly into the hundreds of millions - though maybe not as much as a football stadium. And yes, any such project would require a daunting amount of political and civic will to succeed and take many years to realise. But surely if any building deserves this sort of effort, the Mack does.  A build of this scale and ambition would be a heritage project unlike any other undertaken in Scotland, one that could ultimately provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of people. There are pros as well as cons to be considered. But the biggest pro of all would be the continued existence of the Mack, both as a physical presence and an idea. A world without it would be an eminently poorer place, after all.  Let\u0026rsquos be honest, the original Mack was lost in 2014 what was being re-created and restored until last week was already something new. A complete rebuild would represent yet another, even bigger leap of faith. But it could be done.  Ultimately, it will be up to GSA to decide, and I expect to hear calls for a different future for the site, a less costly one that could be filled with deserving, long-suffering students more quickly. But I believe the people of this great city will galvanise and rebuild their beloved Mack once again if that is what is asked of them. Come on Glasgow, what do you say?"},{"url":null,"title":"Councils  no longer provide quality services   say workers","story":"              Almost three in five council employees believe the local authority they work for no long provides quality services - with the same number also believing their council does not make the right decisions for the public.

The party wants David Davis to face MSPs on the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Europe Committee amid a row over the UK Government\u0027s handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Mr Davis has been asked to give evidence to the committee on several occasions, but is yet to do so.  The SNP was left outraged last week when amendments to the legislation affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate in the House of Commons.  The Scottish Parliament had already voted against granting formal consent to the Bill.  The SNP said the move effectively turned \"on its head\" the Sewel convention, the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters, and called for Scottish Secretary David Mundell to resign.  The opposition to the legislation stems from concerns Holyrood\u0027s powers could be constrained as a result of the legislation, with some of the responsibilities returning from Brussels going to UK ministers instead of those in Edinburgh.  SNP MSP and Europe Committee member Mairi Gougeon said: \"The Tories are tearing up the devolution settlement before our eyes.

The PinkNews reception at the seat of Northern Ireland\u0027s suspended devolved parliament at Stormont will be held on June 28.  Campaigners said it was the first time a DUP leader had agreed to take part in such an occasion.  The country is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not available.  Change is strongly opposed by Democratic Unionists, who argue that civil partnerships are already available and believe marriage is between a man and a woman.  Benjamin Cohen, chief executive and editor-in-chief at PinkNews, said: \"The decision by Arlene Foster to attend the first PinkNews event in Belfast is an important step towards encouraging a dialogue in Northern Ireland and we\u0027re delighted that there will be a number of other senior cross-party representatives attending and speaking.\"  Political powersharing has been suspended in Northern Ireland for months, with Sinn Fein raising identity and rights issues such as same-sex marriage as key matters to be addressed in negotiations.  Mrs Foster recently met members of the Fermanagh Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and the Muslim community as part of a series of gestures aimed towards greater inclusivity.  She said: \"I intend to accept that invitation to demonstrate my acknowledgement of that contribution and to recognise the reality of diversity among our citizens.  \"For me I believe I can hold to my principled position, particularly in reality to the definition of marriage, whilst respecting the diversity across our society and recognising that sexuality is a matter for the individual.  \"All I ask in return is that my, and our views, are also respected and not the subject of the vilest of abuse as has sometimes been the case by a small minority.\"  Mrs Foster said her party was not changing its position on marriage but reaching out to acknowledge the contribution made by a section of the community.  \"Just because we disagree on marriage does not mean that I can\u0027t say that we value those who are LGBT in our society and they should not be the subject of hate because of their sexuality.  \"Remember, everyone is equal under the law and equally subject to the law.\"  She said unionism stood for pluralism and multiculturalism.  \"We must be inclusive and welcome all, recognising they bring added value to a broader and greater overall sum.  \"I want to genuinely reach out to our minority communities and show them the hand of friendship, recognising they have made Northern Ireland their home.  \"If we truly believe in equality of opportunity for all in Northern Ireland, then we must respectfully engage and reach out to those who perhaps have not always been respectful of our position.

The Scottish Information Commissioner revealed last week that ministers had run a secret two-tier FoI system, making it harder for those most likely to embarrass them.  Requests from the media, MSPs and their researchers faced extra scrutiny, despite the law saying the FoI process should be blind, and each request judged solely on its merits.  The government last week accepted the Commissioner\u0026rsquos report in full and agreed to overhaul its procedure to stop taking into account the identity of requesters.  Ahead of a Holyrood debate on transparency tomorrow, Labour will ask MSPs to back \u0026ldquoan independent review of both FoI handling and the recording of information from meetings.  MSP Rhoda Grant said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos damning report reveals repeated attempts by the SNP government to bury bad news.  \u0026ldquoNot only was the clearance process different, but there is some evidence that information was suppressed in answer to these journalists\u0026rsquo requests.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP has so far failed to recognise the seriousness of this unacceptable behaviour and properly take responsibility for it.  \u0026ldquoThat is why Scottish Labour is demanding a full investigation into the SNP\u0027s handling of FOI requests.  \u0026ldquoAnything less would only show that the SNP government simply cannot be trusted.  Meanwhile, the Scottish Liberal Democrats demanded that FoI should be extended to big private contractors delivering public services.  MSP Tavish Scott said ScotRail and the failed contractor Carillion were examples of companies where was a clear public interest in greater transparency.  A survey by the Scottish Information Commissioner found four-fifths of Scots thought organisations building and maintaining schools and hospitals should be subject to FoI.  The government currently spends around \u0026pound11bn a year procuring public services.  Mr Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe public are left with little recourse to uncover how taxpayers\u0027 money is being spent and what level of performance is being achieved.  \u0026ldquoThey want to know whether the contractors maintaining our roads or running our railways and prisons are doing a good job.  \"Some of these firms are vast behemoths handling as much public money as a government department or council, so this is a crucial step to making these firms accountable.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoScotland already has the most open, far-reaching freedom of information laws in the UK \u0026ndash we are working to widen the coverage even further and welcome all suggestions as to how that can be done.  \u0026ldquoLegislation has previously been expanded to a range of arm\u0026rsquos-length-organisations providing cultural, leisure and sporting services on behalf of local authorities, private prison contractors, providers of secure accommodation to children and young people, and grant-aided and independent special schools.  \"An order to extend FOISA to Registered Social Landlords is currently under consideration.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to assess options to further expand coverage, and whether other private companies exercising public functions should be brought within scope."},{"url":null,"title":"Producer behind Oscar-nominated film The Lobster named director of Screen Unit","story":"              A FILM executive who has worked on a series of award-winning films is to lead Scotland\u0027s new screen funding body.

But now Glasgow City Council has confirmed that the while it has not changed \"practical support\" for the event, it had been decided that the People Make Glasgow log shoujld be removed.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur conventions team uses the brand \u0026ndash and, in this case, that reflected the practical support they offer to event organisers and venues in the city.    \u0026ldquoAt the same time, the brand is hugely popular and we appreciate that people in the city feel some sense of ownership of it \u0026ndash which is a really positive thing.  \u0026ldquoThere was clearly some confusion about what it represented on this occasion, so we agreed with the organiser that it was better to remove it.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references.

I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 19, 2018 at 4:25 pmThe Orkney public are being asked for their views on the latest version of the Orkney Local Biodiversity Action Plan.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events. We all share the same vision in terms of upholding Orkney’s reputation as a quality food and drink location and we’re all very proud to be representing the islands on the national stage.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
