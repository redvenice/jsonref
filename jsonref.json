Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall.

But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/17/4EA5D17300000578-6002543-This_year_the_48th_International_Day_took_at_the_Royal_County_of-a-4_1532796367210.jpg","title":"Hubbie home kids Zara goes solo polo","story":"    Zara Tindall has made one of first appearances since having her second child last month  The International Day combines fast-paced test match polo and film, fashion, entertainment \u0026amp societyAbbey Clancy puts on a leggy display in thigh-split spotted...Love Island\u0027s Rosie Williams takes the plunge in a peach...Share this articleZara, 37 and husband Mike\u0027s new arrival Lena Elizabeth, believed to be a nod to Zara\u0027s grandmother the Queen, was born at Stroud Maternity Unit in Gloucestershire weighing 9 lbs 3 oz on June 18. This year the 48th International Day took place at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, Winkfield, Windsor for the first time.                This year the 48th International Day took place at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, Winkfield, Windsor for the first time.

Football star Gareth Bale (left) and rugby legend Sam Warburton in their earlier years\u0027I don\u0027t think Hollywood could have come up with it. You could not have written it.\u0027Thomas, 32, is three years older than Bale and Warburton. But just like them he shared a love for all school sports and excelled in athletics. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it, and I still see it now, how Geraint ran down that home straight in the final of the 1500 metres,\u0027 Mr Williams said.    Geraint Thomas aged 16 in his school sports portraitMany such shared stories made a book Thomas wrote a few years ago a publishing hit and genuinely one of the best in cycling\u0027s vast literature.He told of shaving his legs as a 14-year-old in a Port-a-loo at a race in Germany. Loving his first cycling-specific shades so much that he barely wore them. Suffering such an extreme case of the chronic fatigue cyclists call \u0027bonk\u0027 that, after pedalling home, \u0027I just kept nudging the doorbell with my forehead in the hope that someone inside might hear me.\u0027After 21 days in which the French have made it patently clear how much they loathe the clinical, robotic, po-faced Team Sky machine, grinding on to victory, Thomas provides the antidote. Never has one deeply unpopular team more needed a winner as self-deprecating and human as the man they all call \u0027G\u0027.There was normality from the start - not least school-days at Cardiff\u0027s Whitchurch High School where Thomas, Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton were all alumni within a three year period in the last decade: a Welsh golden generation if ever there was one.A life in cycling seems to have been a happy accident. The nine-year-old Thomas had turned up to swim at the local leisure centre, when he peered through a fence and saw the local Maindy Flyers club training on the track which encircles a neighbouring athletics track. \u0027He came along a few days later and had a go himself,\u0027 the club\u0027s Debbie Wharton said on Friday. \u0027When he first started, he was just like any of the other kids on the bike, wearing baggy shorts and trainers.\u0027 The Lycra came later. Despite prodigious early promise, many were coming around to the view that the 32-year-old had been cut out for a life in the slipstream.His years at the Tour de France have been defined by his work as a domestique for Chris Froome. A bad day is \u0027when Froome is alone in the front group of twenty and there are sixty kilometres to go,\u0027 he said in the book, \u0027The World of Cycling, According to G.\u0027 (Even the title is a mickey-take.)A good day is \u0027when you deflect every nightmarish arrow slung at you. One by one, you throw yourself onto the pyre so that your leader may be venerated.\u0027           Froome (right) appreciates the contribution Thomas has made to his four Tour de France winsHe has venerated Froome far less than Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite shepherding him to three Tour de France titles. It is impossible to avoid the impression that he likes Froome far more. Thomas found Wiggins\u0027 mood unpredictable, though he has found Froome\u0027s lack of ego and often vacant personality endearing.In one of their early encounters, Froome wore a traditional Kenyan sarong - \u0027also known as a towel worn as a skirt,\u0027 Thomas drily observed.Thomas also delighted in Froome\u0027s lack of cycling knowledge. \u0027Who\u0027s that Astana guy? He\u0027s quick,\u0027 he asked Thomas after the 2013 Tour of Oman. \u0027Mate, it\u0027s (Vincenzo) Nibali,\u0027 Thomas informed him.\u0027The success hasn\u0027t gone to his head,\u0027 Thomas has said of Froome. \u0027He can handle the mickey-taking - about how he stays upright on his bike, that he knows nothing about anything but cycling today. Tell him you\u0027re watching the Six Nations and he\u0027ll ask which six and why, what are they doing?\u0027 Even in the last three weeks, he\u0027s been brutally straight about his own place in their dual pecking order. \u0027I\u0027m just \u0027erm… maybe a bit more than a pawn,\u0027 Thomas said after the defining Stage 12, when he eased away from Froome to record an historic second consecutive stage win at Alpe d\u0027Huez.That was the evening Chris Boardman wondered aloud about whether all this modesty was actually a cover for a slight mental deficit.           The Welshman, who rode 20 stages of the 2013 Tour with a broken hip, is treated after a crash          Thomas early in his career as an older teenager racing for a Welsh team, years before he would become a world champion\u0027He\u0027s had several opportunities in the past and… folded, Boardman said on ITV. \u0027I think he\u0027s a little bit fragile on that front and it\u0027s a way to deflect the pressure.\u0027It was an allusion to the solitary off-days which Thomas always seems to have had in the mountains. He was fourth overall after a brilliant Stage 17 climb three years ago, but calamity on La Toussuire two days later saw him lose 22 minutes. He finished 15th.Others who know Thomas well agree that his career in the shadows of others have left the question of that elusive winning mentality answered. \u0027Others were always the stars,\u0027 one source tells Sportsmail. \u0027First Mark Cavendish, who he came through the track academy with, and then Wiggins and Froome on the road. \u0027The elite competitors tend not to be normal. Thomas is balanced. You could have a pint with him. That\u0027s not normal where these kinds of competitors are concerned.\u0027                        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/19/4EAC5FAC00000578-0-image-m-11_1532889011049.jpg","title":"How wealthy elite run Royal Albert Hall profiteering","story":"    Many regard the Last Night of the Proms (pictured in 2013) as a once-in-a-lifetime experienceTo understand why, one need only spend a few minutes using the internet to search for information about the aforementioned Last Night, where the BBC Symphony Orchestra will this year be conducted by Sir Andrew Davis.The unique celebration of British patriotism has been one of the hottest tickets in showbusiness for years.To secure one of the 5,272 seats, which cost the (relatively) bargain price of between £27 and £100, most ordinary members of the public must first attend at least five other Proms concerts. That entitles them to enter a hugely oversubscribed ballot for the right to buy a ticket.Many thousands of classical music enthusiasts go down this arduous road every year. Many regard the Last Night as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Attending is a hard-earned privilege.Unless, that is, you have oodles of cash to spare.For, as so often in our increasingly commercial internet age — where everything seems to have its price — a hefty quantity of tickets also happen to be freely available to those prepared to throw vast sums of money at the problem. So it goes that websites such as the ticket re-sale site Viagogo were this week advertising seats in the stalls for £1,000 each.The world premiere of Donizetti\u0027s L\u0027Ange De Nisida fails to...Holiday firm Thomas Cook reveals it will stop selling trips...Share this articleTo sit in a box in the second tier of the auditorium, you must fork out £1,600. The going rate for a \u0027grand tier\u0027 box seat, regarded as the best in the house, is nearer £2,500.These prices are not, of course, being charged by the event\u0027s organiser, the publicly-owned BBC. Nor are they being levied by the Albert Hall which, as I have pointed out, is a charity.Since members of the public don\u0027t receive their ballot tickets until a few days before the Last Night, very few of them are in a position to cash in, either.Instead, the vast majority of the tickets being flogged so shamelessly turn out to belong to a lucky — and, as we shall see, increasingly controversial — breed of inidual known as a \u0027Member\u0027 of the 151-year-old Royal Albert Hall.Members currently own some 1,270 of the venue\u0027s seats, and they are each issued tickets to around 250 of the events that take place there each year.These include not just the Last Night of the Proms, but also such sought-after events as upcoming gigs by Cliff Richard, Jools Holland, Billy Ocean and The Beach Boys.Members of the Hall, a mixture of iniduals and organisations, can buy or sell seats on the open market (one in the stalls currently fetches around £150,000). They pay an annual fee of around £1,500 for upkeep, and in return are able to do whatever they want with their tickets.          Rock stars Roger Daltrey (pictured) and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027Many choose to return unwanted ones to the box office for resale at face value to the wider public. For this they receive a good share of the spoils, totalling around £5,000 per year per seat should they give up their ticket for every event.Should members feel like maximising their financial returns, however, they can sell tickets for otherwise sold-out events on the open market. This can produce a substantial profit: some estimate between £15,000 and £20,000 per year per seat.The list of members at the centre of this row provides a fascinating insight into the changing nature of Britain\u0027s financial elite. Where once the list was dominated by philanthropists, boxes are now owned by major corporations such as Shell, BAE Systems and Aviva Insurance.Anonymous financial entities control still more. A firm called Palmyra Holdings, based in the tax haven of Jersey, controls five.Two boxes are owned by Astor Care Tickets Limited, a subsidiary of a company run by a doctor named Brian Cheung, that runs an Oxfordshire care home which has been much criticised by the Care Quality Commission.Sixteen seats are controlled by the Albermarle Booking Agency, which runs them commercially. Coutts, the royal bank, and a Guernsey-based entity called Newstead Enterprises control others.The Queen\u0027s lady-in-waiting, the Hon Mary Morrison, owns two seats, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin has a box.There is no suggestion that any of these iniduals or companies flogs their seats online (a friend assures me that Mary Morrison, for one, finds the practice \u0027despicable\u0027), but the fact that some members do put tickets up for resale at huge mark-ups has prompted criticism from a host of performers.Rock stars Roger Daltrey and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027. Harvey Goldsmith, the Live Aid promoter, described it as legal, but \u0027morally reprehensible\u0027.Five years ago, to cite one example, The Times revealed that Earl Spencer, who owns a box of 12 seats, was using the internet to sell his tickets to an Eric Clapton gig for a whopping £4,470, including fees.          The Royal Albert Hall is governed in a manner which contradicts normal guidelinesMoreover, several trustees own large numbers of seats, many of which were purchased as investments, and are flogging tickets in a manner designed to maximise returns. Between them, the board controls 160 seats, which are conservatively valued at £25 million. Should they choose, they could make between £2.6 million and £3.2 million a year with them.The Charity Commission believes this situation to be deeply at odds with standard practice, which dictates that trustees should never financially benefit from their role with a non-profit organisation.They also say it presents a potential conflict of interest: while the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s formal objective is to \u0027promote . . .the Arts and Sciences\u0027, trustees\u0027 decisions on how to fulfil this brief could, in theory, be influenced by a desire to maximise their personal income. For example, board members might be tempted to use their influence to ensure that a particular slot in the calendar was used for a concert by a modish pop star, rather than a worthy (but less desirable) classical music event featuring, say, a youth orchestra.Or they might resist a proposal to make the Last Night of the Proms one of the 150-odd events each year for which members are not given tickets, but are paid a flat rate so the entire Hall can be let to a promoter.Such situations are, so far as we know, entirely theoretical. The Royal Albert Hall admits there is \u0027an authorised conflict of interest in our constitution\u0027, but says it is \u0027managed through a conflicts of interest committee\u0027, to protect the organisation\u0027s \u0027integrity\u0027.However, the Charity Commission takes a different view. The regulator believes it to be wholly unacceptable for a majority of trustees to be exposed to such a conflict of interest.Last year, it asked the then attorney general Jeremy Wright, the Government\u0027s most senior law officer, to refer the structure of the Hall to the Charity Tribunal, which rules on charity law.The attorney general initially agreed, only for the charity to make what the Commission described as \u0027legal threats\u0027. Mr Wright therefore changed his mind in March \u0027to prevent unnecessary litigation\u0027, asking the regulator to seek an alternative solution.That has not proven possible. So earlier this month, the Commission re-applied to the attorney general for the matter to be ruled on by a tribunal. Inevitably, the Royal Albert Hall is once again consulting lawyers. An expensive legal showdown beckons.\u0027A gang of very wealthy iniduals, who have property rights that are under threat, are sure to hire the most expensive lawyers in the land to defend them,\u0027 is how Paul Palmer, of Cass Business School, puts it. \u0027So the Commission will have to take them on. But they are, in my view, bringing charities in general into disrepute. So it\u0027s a case that needs to be heard.\u0027Sharon Hodgson, a Labour MP who campaigns against ticket touting, agrees. She has called the situation at the Hall \u0027shameful\u0027 and says \u0027action needs to be taken\u0027.Certainly, the sums involved are considerable. Last year, the billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe spent £2.76 million on a 12-seater box in the Grand Circle.In March, a neighbouring one went on sale for £3 million. \u0027Boxes of this nature tend to appreciate greatly over time and are a genuine generational purchase,\u0027 said the agent, Harrods Estates.Two of the most controversial members of the Royal Albert Hall are a financier named Leon Baroukh and his family, who own around 50 seats, and Richard Waterbury, the chairman of pensions for a chemicals company, who controls 29.Their seats appear largely to be run as investments, which is particularly provocative since both Baroukh and Waterbury are senior members of the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s board of trustees.Does their combined commercial interest in the charity — worth upwards of £13.5 million — mean they should be excluded from involvement in running it?The Commission says yes. The Hall says no. The public, who help pay for this great monument, are free to make up their own minds about which side is in the right —and what it might say about who really rules Britannia. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/01/00080E3B00000C1D-6005075-The_former_boxer_pictured_in_1991_says_he_has_been_off_medicatio-m-21_1532910123383.jpg","title":"Frank Bruno goes three years without medication bipolar disorder struggle","story":"    Frank Bruno was sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2003 and twice in 2012Former boxer Frank Bruno has revealed he has not needed to take medication for three years after a highly publicised struggle with bipolar disorder.Bruno, 56, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2003 and on another two occasions in 2012.After taking part in the Great North Run in 2015, Bruno told the Sunday Mirror he admitted himself to hospital after he went \u0027hell for leather\u0027 in training and \u0027hit a brick wall\u0027.Bruno credited his improved well-being on his daily fitness regime, eating well and a positive outlook.The former heavyweight champion told celebrity magazine Hello!: \u0027It\u0027s the best I\u0027ve ever felt.

Final figures are due August 15.Asked about the country turning into a one-party state, the CPP spokesman said it was \u0027the decision of the people,\u0027 adding that Cambodia\u0027s constitution allows for a multi-party system.But the ballot lacked any serious challengers after Hun Sen cracked down on the opposition last year, leading to the arrest one of its leaders and then the dissolution of the party by the Supreme Court.Opposition figures had urged a boycott of the poll.But election authorities warned they would take action against those pressing for a \u0027clean-finger\u0027 campaign and pointed to an 82 percent turnout as evidence that the boycott call had failed.Experts say high turnouts are common in authoritarian states where voter intimidation is more widespread.Yet in a sign of a kickback from unhappy voters, around 600,000 ballots - around 10 percent of the total - were spoiled, according to a preliminary count by the National Election Commission.   Sunday\u0027s ballot has prolonged Hun Sen\u0027s 33-year rule, but observers say that questions of legitimacy may haunt the wily political survivor as frustration sets in over lack of changeHun Sen came to power in 1985 in a country still plagued by civil war and his CPP has won every election since 1998.But wearied by a culture of impunity and corruption more than 44 percent of voters backed the opposition CNRP in 2013 polls, creating the most serious challenge to Hun Sen in years.This time the Cambodian leader ruthlessly moved against his critics in the election run-up, corralling civil society, independent media and political opponents.That led many western governments to pull their support from the vote.It was \u0027neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people,\u0027 the White House said in a statement.The US would consider a \u0027significant expansion\u0027 of visa restrictions introduced last year against some senior Cambodian officials, it warned.In contrast China, a key Cambodia ally which has provided cash and soft loans to Hun Sen\u0027s government without raising questions over human rights and democracy, offered its \u0027sincere congratulations\u0027 on the poll, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. The 65-year-old Hun Sen is also seen as a stabilising force in the eyes of many in a kingdom with a bloody and bitter recent history that s civil war, the horrors of the Khmer Rouge and occupation by Vietnam.Hun Sen has cultivated his support base through rural and urban infrastructure and investment schemes that have added malls and condos to the skyline of the once sleepy capital Phnom Penh.The premier also adroitly turned to Cambodia\u0027s garment sector, which employs about 750,00 people, showering cash gifts on workers in the months ahead of polls.\u0027I am happy that the Cambodian People\u0027s Party won overwhelmingly, more than previous mandates,\u0027 said supporter Sang Kimson, 38, the morning after the election.But many other Cambodians are despondent at the idea of yet another term for Hun Sen, who is among the world\u0027s longest-serving leaders.\u0027It is him again,\u0027 shrugged one man sitting outside a coffee shop who asked not to be named and who said he felt \u0027hopeless\u0027 watching the results come in.Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia ision at Human Rights Watch, predicted simmering discontent.\u0027I think what we will see here in Cambodia is continued passive resistance and anger by the Cambodian people, they weren\u0027t given the opportunity to vote for the people they wanted,\u0027 he said.Hun Sen has held onto power through political and family alliances in the police, military and media.He was installed as prime minister during the Vietnamese occupation of the 1980s after defecting from the Khmer Rouge, which killed a quarter of Cambodia\u0027s population from 1975 to 1979. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/17/4EABDC8300000578-0-image-a-51_1532881392116.jpg","title":"Speed limits traffic jam information beamed straight car dashboards new trial","story":"    Highways England is going to test new 5G technology on the A2 and M2 between London and Dover later this year (pictured at the M25 junction) and some gantries could be torn downThe £20million trial will start by Christmas and run until the end of 2020 and the technology will only work in the newest of cars.   The report says: \u0027This may eventually allow some roadside infrastructure, such as gantries, to be removed.\u0027 Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the technology is there but is concerned about removing too many signs in case the technology fails. But it is already being used in  Belgium, France and Holland.Staycations ruined as torrential rain and 50mph gale force...Stansted luggage chaos as hundreds of unclaimed bags and...Back on the BOIL!

There remain major questions over how much of the waste put out for recycling by households actually is recycled (file picture)Amounts going to incinerators have risen in recent years, while a high proportion is sent for recycling abroad.The export trade in recycling material took a blow last year when China announced it would stop accepting large amounts of western rubbish.

Many regard the Last Night as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Attending is a hard-earned privilege.Unless, that is, you have oodles of cash to spare.For, as so often in our increasingly commercial internet age — where everything seems to have its price — a hefty quantity of tickets also happen to be freely available to those prepared to throw vast sums of money at the problem.

Nor are they being levied by the Albert Hall which, as I have pointed out, is a charity.Since members of the public don\u0027t receive their ballot tickets until a few days before the Last Night, very few of them are in a position to cash in, either.Instead, the vast majority of the tickets being flogged so shamelessly turn out to belong to a lucky — and, as we shall see, increasingly controversial — breed of inidual known as a \u0027Member\u0027 of the 151-year-old Royal Albert Hall.Members currently own some 1,270 of the venue\u0027s seats, and they are each issued tickets to around 250 of the events that take place there each year.These include not just the Last Night of the Proms, but also such sought-after events as upcoming gigs by Cliff Richard, Jools Holland, Billy Ocean and The Beach Boys.Members of the Hall, a mixture of iniduals and organisations, can buy or sell seats on the open market (one in the stalls currently fetches around £150,000). They pay an annual fee of around £1,500 for upkeep, and in return are able to do whatever they want with their tickets.          Rock stars Roger Daltrey (pictured) and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027Many choose to return unwanted ones to the box office for resale at face value to the wider public. For this they receive a good share of the spoils, totalling around £5,000 per year per seat should they give up their ticket for every event.Should members feel like maximising their financial returns, however, they can sell tickets for otherwise sold-out events on the open market. This can produce a substantial profit: some estimate between £15,000 and £20,000 per year per seat.The list of members at the centre of this row provides a fascinating insight into the changing nature of Britain\u0027s financial elite. Where once the list was dominated by philanthropists, boxes are now owned by major corporations such as Shell, BAE Systems and Aviva Insurance.Anonymous financial entities control still more. A firm called Palmyra Holdings, based in the tax haven of Jersey, controls five.Two boxes are owned by Astor Care Tickets Limited, a subsidiary of a company run by a doctor named Brian Cheung, that runs an Oxfordshire care home which has been much criticised by the Care Quality Commission.Sixteen seats are controlled by the Albermarle Booking Agency, which runs them commercially. Coutts, the royal bank, and a Guernsey-based entity called Newstead Enterprises control others.The Queen\u0027s lady-in-waiting, the Hon Mary Morrison, owns two seats, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin has a box.There is no suggestion that any of these iniduals or companies flogs their seats online (a friend assures me that Mary Morrison, for one, finds the practice \u0027despicable\u0027), but the fact that some members do put tickets up for resale at huge mark-ups has prompted criticism from a host of performers.Rock stars Roger Daltrey and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027. Harvey Goldsmith, the Live Aid promoter, described it as legal, but \u0027morally reprehensible\u0027.Five years ago, to cite one example, The Times revealed that Earl Spencer, who owns a box of 12 seats, was using the internet to sell his tickets to an Eric Clapton gig for a whopping £4,470, including fees.          The Royal Albert Hall is governed in a manner which contradicts normal guidelinesMoreover, several trustees own large numbers of seats, many of which were purchased as investments, and are flogging tickets in a manner designed to maximise returns. Between them, the board controls 160 seats, which are conservatively valued at £25 million. Should they choose, they could make between £2.6 million and £3.2 million a year with them.The Charity Commission believes this situation to be deeply at odds with standard practice, which dictates that trustees should never financially benefit from their role with a non-profit organisation.They also say it presents a potential conflict of interest: while the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s formal objective is to \u0027promote . . .the Arts and Sciences\u0027, trustees\u0027 decisions on how to fulfil this brief could, in theory, be influenced by a desire to maximise their personal income. For example, board members might be tempted to use their influence to ensure that a particular slot in the calendar was used for a concert by a modish pop star, rather than a worthy (but less desirable) classical music event featuring, say, a youth orchestra.Or they might resist a proposal to make the Last Night of the Proms one of the 150-odd events each year for which members are not given tickets, but are paid a flat rate so the entire Hall can be let to a promoter.Such situations are, so far as we know, entirely theoretical. The Royal Albert Hall admits there is \u0027an authorised conflict of interest in our constitution\u0027, but says it is \u0027managed through a conflicts of interest committee\u0027, to protect the organisation\u0027s \u0027integrity\u0027.However, the Charity Commission takes a different view. The regulator believes it to be wholly unacceptable for a majority of trustees to be exposed to such a conflict of interest.Last year, it asked the then attorney general Jeremy Wright, the Government\u0027s most senior law officer, to refer the structure of the Hall to the Charity Tribunal, which rules on charity law.The attorney general initially agreed, only for the charity to make what the Commission described as \u0027legal threats\u0027. Mr Wright therefore changed his mind in March \u0027to prevent unnecessary litigation\u0027, asking the regulator to seek an alternative solution.That has not proven possible. So earlier this month, the Commission re-applied to the attorney general for the matter to be ruled on by a tribunal. Inevitably, the Royal Albert Hall is once again consulting lawyers. An expensive legal showdown beckons.\u0027A gang of very wealthy iniduals, who have property rights that are under threat, are sure to hire the most expensive lawyers in the land to defend them,\u0027 is how Paul Palmer, of Cass Business School, puts it. \u0027So the Commission will have to take them on. But they are, in my view, bringing charities in general into disrepute. So it\u0027s a case that needs to be heard.\u0027Sharon Hodgson, a Labour MP who campaigns against ticket touting, agrees. She has called the situation at the Hall \u0027shameful\u0027 and says \u0027action needs to be taken\u0027.Certainly, the sums involved are considerable. Last year, the billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe spent £2.76 million on a 12-seater box in the Grand Circle.In March, a neighbouring one went on sale for £3 million. \u0027Boxes of this nature tend to appreciate greatly over time and are a genuine generational purchase,\u0027 said the agent, Harrods Estates.Two of the most controversial members of the Royal Albert Hall are a financier named Leon Baroukh and his family, who own around 50 seats, and Richard Waterbury, the chairman of pensions for a chemicals company, who controls 29.Their seats appear largely to be run as investments, which is particularly provocative since both Baroukh and Waterbury are senior members of the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s board of trustees.Does their combined commercial interest in the charity — worth upwards of £13.5 million — mean they should be excluded from involvement in running it?The Commission says yes. The Hall says no. The public, who help pay for this great monument, are free to make up their own minds about which side is in the right —and what it might say about who really rules Britannia. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/23/4EAE5CE600000578-6005103-image-m-4_1532903839057.jpg","title":"England rugby star Ben Foden romped PR girl 26","story":"      It\u0027s over!

It is both a love story and a screeching train wreck of violence, cruelty and obsession. Its words contain a strength and soul that every writer hopes to achieve, yet few manage. As for the author, although an enigma to the point of myth, Emily Brontë has resonated with readers of all ages worldwide. Brontë’s novel does not shy away from the uncomfortable truths that make us human. And that is why her works strike home, generation after generation.After publication in 1847, Wuthering Heights unsettled and outraged critics. Its characters were described as “demons in human form” and some called for the book to be discarded or burned. After Emily’s death a year later, Wuthering Heights continued to disturb readers with its violent, graphic content. In the preface to the second edition, Charlotte Brontë leaped to her sister’s defence, calling her an innocent, primal child of the moors. It was better to forge a myth than admit that a rational person could write such things.Emily had, however, been imagining and writing such things since she was a child. Aged 11, she had bold visions about what would become key plot details of Wuthering Heights now housed in the Brontë Parsonage Museum, a little picture drawn by Brontë in 1829 depicts a smashed mullioned window, with a hand reaching through. It is the earliest documented reference to Cathy’s famous appearance at Lockwood’s bedroom window, where, after roaming the dark and icy moor, the ghostly heroine wails and claws at her childhood bedroom window – “let me in, let me in!”But, Wuthering Heights’s main origins lie in a collaborative partnership Brontë had with her sister Anne. As teenagers, they crafted a make-believe kingdom set in a familiar, thunderous Yorkshire landscape called Gondal.From 1832 until their deaths in the late 1840s, the pair would escape to their world and immerse themselves in a fantasy of castles, craggy mountaintops and howling winds. Gondal was a Romeo-and-Juliet-inspired saga, with four dynasties battling for both heart and kingdom. The siblings would plot and act out stories wherever and whenever they could, whether huddled around the fireplace at the Parsonage or on a train journey across the Yorkshire countryside.For Emily, this imaginary space was an exercise in escapism. Her verses are fraught with love affairs between rulers and scenes of exile and death in rotting dungeons. Not only is the content sensational but also, in a revolutionary move for the era, Gondal is led by a warrior queen. Coinciding with the coronation of Queen Victoria, Queen Augusta Geraldine Almeda ascends toGondal’s throne in 1837. Like Victoria, Augusta would also fight to protect and expand her empire. She is described as a strong-minded Amazonian beauty who is ruthless in her personal and political relationships. After taking lovers, she drives them to exile or imprisonment. One dies of a broken heart, another is driven to suicide. Writing as Augusta, Emily says:Strong I stand though I have borneAnger hate and bitter scornStrong I stand and laugh to seeHow mankind have fought with meShade of mast’ry I contemnAll the puny ways of menThe author had a deep attachment to her heroine who, like her creator, loved her wild and rugged kingdom with its jagged landscape swathed in heather. It is easy to see how, years later, this regal woman would be seamlessly remodelled into Wuthering Heights’ wilful Cathy. Like her prototype, Cathy is as wild as the environment she inhabits, and, like Augusta, breaks the hearts of men who yearn for her. Cathy is by no means the strongest female lead in the collective Brontë works, but she embodies the spirit of Augusta, fighting to survive in a cutthroat patriarchal society. Having published her most novel under a male pseudonym (“Ellis Bell”) to escape the prejudice of male critics, Emily knew this fight all too well.

In preparation for Brexit, Brussels has proposed ideas that could give the EU more responsibility for regulating foreign clearing houses.The former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean told a House of Lords Committee in 2016 he had “absolutely no doubt at all” that London would lose euro clearing after Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39dcfeec660666fae7953791421cc52af57d0898/0_122_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60e52ace8d30941d5f37624aed5109de","title":"markets cautious after tech sell off and ahead of central bank meetings business live","story":"Investors nervous after Facebook and Twitter declines and await interest rate news this week from UK, US and JapanOil prices are moving higher, helped by last week’s strong growth figures from the US.The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence.Here’s the Press Association on the UK lending figures:The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show.Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January.It said: “Credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years and the growth rate of credit card lending has exceeded that of other loans and advances (which includes personal loans, overdrafts and car finance) since January 2018.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the continued strength in non-mortgage borrowing “is symptomatic of the pressure on consumers’ finances, rather than rising confidence about the outlook for their incomes”. The recent volatility in tech shares could herald a tricky summer for markets, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading platform XTB:The summer months are often seen as doldrums as far as the markets are concerned with the perception dating back several centuries and characterised succinctly with the “sell-in-May” trading adage.However, there have been some large moves in recent years and there are growing signs that we could be set for another turbulent August as we saw in 2011 and 2015. The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks.Last week’s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August’s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility.Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says:This meeting is Mark Carney’s leap of faith. He has led the markets to expect a rate rise, so he now has little choice but to follow through or risk losing credibility.The pound is having an uncertain time as investors try to decide whether or not an interest rate rise is coming this week. Sterling is of course being influenced not only by the prospect of a rate rise but the continuing Brexit discussions and the progress (or lack of it) being made by the government.Ahead of the latest eurozone GDP figures due on Tuesday, ING economist Bert Colijn said:While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week’s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk.Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures.The EC’s economic sentiment indicator for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3. The commission said:Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from decreases in industry and retail trade confidence, which were offset by an increase in the services sector. Confidence in construction remained broadly stable while it stayed unchanged among consumers. The marginally better outcome of the headline indicator for the EU (+0.1) was mainly due to the marked improvement of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economy, the UK (+1.6) More on the UK borrowing figures:Signs of life in the UK housing market, as mortgage approvals picked up last month.Bank of England figures showed approvals rising from 64,684 in May to 65,619, slightly better than expected and hitting a five month high. Net mortgage lending rose by £3.851bn while consumer lending increased by £1.567bn.Some bad news from Heineken, the world’s second-largest beer maker. Reuters reports:The brewer of Heineken lager, Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider reported first-half earnings below market expectations and said its operating margin would decline by 20 basis points in 2018, compared with a previous forecast of a 25 basis point increase, after it fell sharply in the first six months.Overall, the brewer sold more beer in the first six months of 2018 than expected, with growth rose steepest in its two most profitable markets, Vietnam and Mexico, along with Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Ethiopia and Russia.Heineken shares traded down 6.0 percent at 86.84 euros, by far the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares.The Dutch brewer, whose Heineken lager is the top seller in Europe, said the new guidance was because of the negative translational hit from currencies concentrated more in its higher margin countries, such as Vietnam, and a larger dilutive effect of its expanding Brazilian business.Heineken acquired the loss-making Brazilian operations of Japan’s Kirin in 2017 to become the number two player in the South America country, and had previously warned of an impact on its margins. The latest Twitter comments from the US president have moved away from trade disputes for the moments, which may give some relief to investors, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management:US President Trump has been active on Twitter. Most of the tweets are about media and the Mueller investigation, and do not matter to markets. However, there was also a threat of shutting down the US government if US President Trump’s “big, beautiful wall” is not approved by Congress. There is a 30 September budget deadline.The downbeat mood continues although it is by no means a rout. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:The markets got off to a negative start on what is going to be a crazy busy week, with investors caught between last Friday’s US tech-sell-off and the Fed and Bank of England meetings on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.As for the Eurozone indices, there were in a similar mood to their UK counterpart. The DAX dipped 35 points, taking it back under 12850, with the CAC slipping 20 points to slip below 5500. In comparison to the UK and US the region doesn’t have a huge amount going on this week, meaning its trading could be driven by the euro’s relationship to the dollar and pound.GVC, the owner of bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral, is topping the FTSE 100 risers after confirming a $200m deal with MGM Resorts, the world’s biggest casino operator.As expected, European markets have begun the week on a downbeat note, following the tech sell-off on Wall Street on Friady.On the results front, London focused estate agency Foxtons has slumped into loss as the capital’s property market continues to struggle.It lost £2.5m in the first half compared to a £3.8m profit this time last year, and said the outlook was mixed with a subdued sales market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said:Deutsche is reported by the Financial Times to be moving almost half its euro clearing activities from London to Frankfurt (£).Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Stock markets are expected to open lower after a tech sell-off on Wall Street at the end of last week. Investors are beginning to wonder if the relentless rise of the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now owned by Alphabet) - could be over.More likely is that there will be increasing ergence between them. Amazon reported stellar results once more and Alphabet easily shook off the effects of a European Commission fine, but Facebook recorded the biggest ever one day loss in value on Thursday after its outlook statement unnerved the market. This followed disappointing results from Netflix a few days earlier.Earnings season had set off to a good start, however tech stock headlines have quickly dominated, transforming perceptions and raising questions over valuations of FAANG stocks. With Netflix, Facebook and now Twitter disappointing with results, investors are seriously questioning these advertising revenues based or subscription-based models. On the other hand, Amazon beat earnings expectations comfortably, whilst Alphabet shrugged off a €5 billion fine. This original FAANG trade, which petty much guaranteed impressive returns across previous years, suddenly looks a lot more complicated. Whilst prior to the year these stocks could do no wrong, suddenly that is no longer the case.Investors will now be looking ahead to Apple’s results on Tuesday, with the iPhone maker expected to be closer to the Amazon end of the scale than Facebook,This week also sees a number of central bank meetings. The Bank of England is expected to sanction an interest rate rise on Thursday, but the US Federal Reserve is likely to hold fire a day earlier, albeit it could well give further hints at a September increase. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:It’s the turn of the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to guide on monetary policy, and while no surprises are expected from the FOMC, we could get some policy tweaks from the Bank of Japan after last week’s interventions in the JGB market. We could also get a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday when they meet to run the rule over the UK economy and the latest inflation report.Back to today, and there are a few economic numbers to look out for.9.30 BST UK mortgage approvals and net lending"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72c8eb360979207c1ba6c58438e0336dda910d3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b6e3322706d838ac11f7ea1369dfe3","title":"follow new silk road china belt","story":"Jon Watts journeys along China’s Belt and Road as it flows from the steppes of Central Asia down to the Black Sea and into Europe, creating ports, railways and entire cities from scratch and radically remaking the lives of the people in its pathThe Silk Road setting feels timeless: an expanse of desert scrub below the Tianshan Mountains, where weather-beaten farmers herd flocks of sheep much as their descendants might have done in Marco Polo’s day.Rising up surreally in their midst, however, are the new landmarks of a modern development: the gleaming yellow gantries of the world’s biggest dry port and the shopping mall towers of a duty-free zone the size of a city.Welcome to Khorgos, China’s new land gateway to the mineral-rich resources of Central Asia and the consumer-rich markets of Europe. Further from the sea than almost anywhere on Earth, it is both the middle of nowhere and the centre of Beijing’s plans for a new world order.China is opening new commercial routes across Eurasia. The construction of a new network of Silk Roads – as well as railways, pipelines, ports and ferry routes – is part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.It is a vague concept, but there has been concrete progress. Next month Xi is due to open a China-to-Europe highway, which stretches 8,445 kilometres (5,247 miles) from the Yellow Sea to the Baltic. Last year, a new section of railway came into operation between Khorgos and Urumqi, the capital of China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Almost every week there is a new opening, unveiling or funding announcement.For those who fear China’s rise, the Belt and Road is terrifying. They worry Beijing will use trade routes to increase its influence and export an authoritarian brand of politics. Some have warned of an “infrastructure power grab” and a new Great Game, referring to the 19th century scheming as Britain and Russia vied for control of commerce between Europe and Asia.Others see Belt and Road as a boon that will redraw the world’s trade routes and turn peripheral countries and cities into hubs. Ancient routes are being rejuvenated, new ones opened, and cities are being built from scratch. visited three cities on the central corridor of the new Silk Road – Khorgos, Aktau and Anaklia – to find out how China’s grand plan is reshaping this often overlooked part of the world.“There’s China and there’s Kazakhstan,” says young trader Nurzaman Nurkadilov as he looks down at the border fence from the roof of his 20-storey hotel in the Khorgos special economic zone. “And there are shops, shops, shops. Nothing more. Nothing less. This will be the world’s biggest duty free.”He points out the dozen or so mega-malls – each the size of an airport terminal – that have risen from the desert in the past few years then the cluster of cranes building ever bigger emporiums: one topped with a yellow dome, another jagging up several dozen storeys in a Dragon’s Teeth design.“In a couple of months, my uncle is going to build a Happy Land theme park over there,” he says, gesturing towards the Kazakh side, where there are far fewer cranes, more empty plots and lower buildings.The disparity between the two sides of the city is unsurprising given Khorgos itself is a manifestation of political will and old school centralised planning. Although both countries are invested in the project, the one calling the shots is China (population 1.4 billion, GDP $11.2tn) rather than Kazakhstan (population 18 million, GDP $133bn). That imbalance is a source of concern but also a force many hope to tilt in their favour.Rauan Akkeshin, chief of staff of Khorgos International Centre of Boundary Cooperation, predicts a million people will move to the city on the Chinese side. He wants to lure tourists and businesspeople across the border into Kazakhstan with entertainment and conference facilities.He shows off tiny white plastic models of the planned circus, race track, water park, hotels and a conference centre where Chinese executives will be able to meet foreign partners without needing a passport.Despite doubts about the pace of progress and rumours of corruption that resulted in the fall of his predecessor, he says investors have committed money and the goal is to finish everything by 2022. “This place is already the centre of the Silk Road. At first the visitors were only Kazakhs. Now they come from all over Central Asia. In future, we hope they come from Europe.”Tourists clearly enjoy posing for selfies on the border line, where a single step over the red-blue ision on the road can take them across two time zones. But very few areas are bustling and some, such as the Yiwu mall on the far extreme of the neutral zone, are eerily empty.Chinese tourist Lanzhen Tang is unimpressed. “I like it but it’s a bit small. There aren’t many people,” she says before posing for photographs beside a stretch limousine.Traders say visitor numbers collapsed a couple of months ago after the Chinese tightened import controls and restricted the movement of people between the two sides. This was ostensibly done to crack down on corruption, but ethnic discrimination and political tension may be a bigger factor.On the walls of every shopping mall on the Chinese side are posters forbidding entry to any man with a long beard or any woman with a hijab. Visitors must pass through a metal detector and have their bag checked by security guards. On the streets outside, there are CCTV cameras and the police presence is striking. This is due to tensions in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Several cities there have witnessed ethnic riots, terrorist attacks and fierce repression by state security forces, who have blocked all public displays of Islamic faith.This threatens to undermine Khorgos. Most traders are Muslim and unhappy at restrictions on their co-religionists. As businessmen, they are also troubled by the frequent regulatory changes.It is clear China is calling the shots, but its heavy-handedness has not halted corruption. Businessmen in the neutral zone say they can bribe customs officials to ensure their goods get through, that illegal casinos and brothels operate inside the shells of half-completed buildings, and that there have been secret bare-knuckle boxing tournaments, where spectators could gamble on two teams formed of 10 Chinese and 10 Kazakh fighters.But Khorgos is more than a bizarre bazaar. The entire region around it is being transformed. Construction will soon begin on an airport. Work is already under way on an industrial centre, which will offer a rent holiday and zero taxation until 2035. Eventually the region’s planners hope to attract IT and robotics companies. By 2025, they aim to create 25,000 jobs.Zhasulan Khamzin cheerfully admits he had never heard of Khorgos before moving here five years ago to manage the world’s biggest dry port and the installation of three 41-tonne gantries to move containers across flatbed trains on the different gauge tracks on the two sides of the border. “We are developing an area where there was nothing before,” he says. “We are pioneers.”The first train passed through in July 2015. A year later, the facility handled 45,000 containers. This year, it is set to exceed 150,000. Meanwhile, a new dormitory town – Nurkent – has been built from scratch and is home to 4,000 families. Khamzin predicts this too will become a city.“Nurkent is still just a baby, but it will grow. This will be one of the biggest cities in Kazakhstan. By 2035, we expect 100,000 people will live here,” he says.The climate is not exactly welcoming. In winter, residents put up with thick snow and temperatures as low as -36C (-32F). In summer, they bake in 40C (104F) heat. But relatively high salaries, no tax and free accommodation are bringing people in.“I didn’t want to come but I had no choice, because my previous company went out of business,” says crane operator Osipova Galina, as she sits down after a 12-hour shift. “My first impression wasn’t good. Just very ugly shopping malls surrounded by a barbed wire fence.”But she has warmed to this place on the corridor into central Asia. “The people here are very committed. They are invested in this,” she says.As the sleeper train clunks slowly out of Khorgos, passengers watch the evening sun dip below the dunes. Almost all are small-scale traders and shoppers, making the journey from the megamalls on the border to their home towns.The train trundles overnight to Almaty, once the capital of Kazakhstan. From here, people and goods are sucked away in a spaghetti of directions. The architects of the New Silk Road are working to upgrade three main routes: north, through Russia southwest through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iran and – most direct but complex of all – due west along a central corridor that passes for more than 1,500km across the vast deserts of central Kazakhstan to the Caspian Sea port of Aktau and beyond.During the Cold War, this Soviet-era port city was shrouded in military secrecy. Built by prisoners in the 1950 and 60s, it was initially little more than a barracks and a uranium mine. That legacy is still apparent in the garrison-like housing blocks in the centre, an MiG fighter plane that seems about to fly off from a marble plinth, and the grimly contaminated Lake Koshkar-Ata on the outskirts, where farmers take horses and camels to drink despite radiation hazard signs and a stream of stinking black effluent pouring from an industrial complex. On windy days, contaminated particles blow into the city, which is home to 178,000 people.Over the past 30 years, Aktau has opened up and the focus has shifted to oil production. Belt and Road is seen by the Kazakh government as an opportunity to accelerate the city’s rebirth as a logistics hub, tourist resort and conference centre.City planners want to clean up the lake and plant rows of trees to hold back the dust, but progress has been slow. Russian influence is still strong here, but Chinese companies have invested in oil fields and a bitumen plant, which supplies the needs of the growing number of Silk Road highway upgrades.The first consignment from Khorgos to Europe passed through earlier this year. It was a container of tomatoes, farmed in Xinjiang, and sent to a paste processing plant in Italy. Last month, there was another first when a consignment of cars passed through on a journey from Chongqing via Khorgos to Iran. It took just 14 days.“We can do it in half the time it previously took,” says Martin Voetmann, who heads the Aktau Port operation for logistics company DP World. “If we had sent it by the regular sea route, it would have taken 40 to 45 days.”Although it is the shortest distance across Eurasia, the central corridor of the Silk Road requires multi-modal shifts between trains and ships, and the bureaucracy of border checks in at least five countries. The old Soviet ferries which ply the Caspian are not made for modern container lorries. There is no timetable. Both cargo and people can wait more than a week for passage, which takes another 20 to 40 hours depending on weather.The high expectations of China are shared by senior figures in business and politics in Tblisi. Ketevan Bochorishvili, a former Georgian vice minister of economy, hopes Beijing will push forward with a $2.5bn plan to build a deep sea port at Anaklia on the Black Sea coast.The scheme has been in limbo for most of the past 10 years, but she says the Belt and Road Initiative has nudged it close to reality. A new free-trade agreement with China came into force this year, and last month Bochorishvili signed a memorandum of understanding with a Hong Kong logistics firm.Anaklia is currently little more than a village. Cows and pigs wander across the single-lane access road. In September, the UK consultancy Buro-Happold will present a masterplan for a free industrial zone and city at Anaklia. Work is already under way to clear the site of the planned new city – an area of marsh and dunes patrolled by security guards on horseback, whose main role is to fend off invading cattle.The project has been briefly held up by unexploded Russian bombs, which had to be dismantled and removed – a reminder of recent conflicts with the breakaway region of Abkhazia. A major Silk Road project in this troubled region would be a geostrategic boost for Georgia, which pitches itself as the most democratic and market-friendly of the former Soviet states.If the project comes off, Anaklia will be the yang to Khorgos’s yin, the western gateway on the shortest overland route between China and Europe. “It will be a mix of Khorgos and Dubai but with the climate of California,” says Bochorishvili.There are still many ifs in these three New Silk Road cities – one embryonic, one hoping to be reborn and the other created out of nothing – but their architects feel the long-term trends may be in their favour.The material impact on global trade should not be overstated – it will never compare to the shipping industry – but the political ramifications are significant.In many ways the New Silk Road is typical of the Old Silk Road, which has usually been an east-west flow of goods and people, with heavy restrictions in the opposition direction. The exception was during the 13th century, when the Mongols briefly unified the Eurasian landmass and opened up the west-east path for European traders. That allowed Marco Polo to make his famous 24-year round-trip to China.He returned to Venice with silk, spices and incredible tales of the cities he visited. “I have not told half of what I saw for I knew I would not be believed,” he said. He might say the same of claims made for the New Silk Road – but the journey would certainly be shorter.Design and Development by: Frank Hulley-Jones and Garry Blight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2badb05d9f8269d4d735eb298064e7b6e043d1/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5b5acf2be8053d9e9c0f1fdf29524c","title":"zimbabwe rival parties results election","story":"The post-Mugabe era will be run by one of two candidates. But key to Zimbabwe’s progress is showing it can run a fair election“Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again.” For pretty much the average life expectancy of many Zimbabweans, one man has ruled the country with an iron fist. Eight elections were held during his rule – and every time, that fist ensured victory for Robert Mugabe.On Monday Zimbabweans go to the polls to elect his successor. The current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, the man who finally ousted Mugabe in a bloodless coup last November, has also crushed his enemies ruthlessly in the past – but his iron fist lies within a well-padded velvet glove.Mnangagwa goes head to head at the polls with Nelson Chamisa, 40, who took over as leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after Morgan Tsvangirai died earlier this year.Whoever wins, this election heralds a new dawn for Zimbabwe. Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again. Certainly Mnangagwa brings a lot of baggage from the Mugabe era – having been the former president’s righthand man. But he is different in many significant ways – today, Mugabe even urged voters to turn their backs on his leadership, and went so far as to wish Chamisa well. Most importantly, Mnangagwa understands business and is determined to resuscitate Zimbabwe’s moribund economy and give the people what they so desperately want and need – jobs.He is primarily a soldier, having left Zimbabwe as a teenager in the early 1960s for military training in China. He has fashioned himself after the former communist leader Deng Xiaoping, who modernised China and laid the foundations for the economic powerhouse it has become, while maintaining a strictly authoritarian regime.Deng abandoned many orthodox communist doctrines to incorporate elements of the free-enterprise system. Mnangagwa seems determined to do the same for Zimbabwe. He is a wealthy man in his own right, having run Zanu-PF’s and his own businesses since the early 1980s. He has been mentioned in a UN report on the plundering of mining and logging resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo together with General Sibusiso Moyo, who is now the foreign affairs minister.While Mugabe was a consummate manipulator, skilfully playing people off against each other and weaving a complex web of patronage, Mnangagwa is a much more of a strategist. He will be prepared to make tough decisions that could ultimately benefit the economy. He has certainly been more successful in attracting foreign investment in the short time he has been in power than Mugabe was in decades of berating the west.The MDC’s Chamisa is just as pro-business as Mnangagwa, and to his credit has surrounded himself with several capable technocrats. There is no whiff of corruption about him and he has been drawing massive crowds in many rural areas which, under Mugabe, were no-go areas for his party. And of course the MDC’s democratic and human rights credentials are well established – while those of Zanu-PF are a constant cause for concern.Should Chamisa win the election, there is no doubt that the world would welcome Zimbabwe back into the fold with open arms. But Mnangagwa is smart enough to realise that international recognition of his government can only come if this election is acknowledged as free and fair by the global community. While Britain has been unswervingly supportive of the post-Mugabe regime, the US has reserved judgment – recently renewing its sanctions on Zanu-PF leaders and companies, but promising to lift them once credible elections have taken place.And there’s the rub. Many believe it is impossible for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to run a free and fair poll. It is accused of rigging every election since it was established in 2004 it is still staffed largely by the military and Zanu-PF loyalists and it has shown shameful bias towards the ruling party in recent months. For example, the law says the ballot paper should be in alphabetical order, which places Chamisa second on the 23-person list. The commission cleverly formatted the paper into two lop-sided columns, in order to place Mnangagwa at the very top of column two.So this election could bring three possible results: if Mnangagwa wins, the MDC already has enough ammunition against the electoral commission to cry foul. If Chamisa wins convincingly, it will be a new dawn indeed – but the military might not accept this, as the generals have already invested a lot in Mnangagwa.But if there is no clear winner, the most sensible way forward would be for the two protagonists to agree to a marriage of convenience – otherwise known as a government of national unity.• Wilf Mbanga is the founder, editor and publisher of The Zimbabwean weekly, published in the UK and Johannesburg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08d97d7fb4d3e37c1e0fc8291092129b5b49af89/159_169_3816_2290/master/3816.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aab047391a2bac68da5f4addaa4c4087","title":"labour kate hoey deselect vauxhall mp independent thinker expel","story":"There are unfashionable causes, and there’s party politics. It seems an outdated way of running a country: at a time when we demand clarity, conviction and purpose, political parties look messy, unruly, essentially ungovernable. But this is what makes them so valuable. And it’s why the treatment of Kate Hoey and Frank Field by some Labour party members should be a cause for reflection, if not concern.Britain’s major political parties are essentially coalitions. There are wings, factions, wings with wings, factions within factions. This is frustrating for those who want their politics neat and tidy, who are convinced of their own righteousness and see dissenters as enemies. But this disorderliness is to be cherished, for it militates against zealotry. It is no friend of that seductive but ultimately destructive idea we call ideological purity.Now, there is no doubt that Hoey is something of an eccentric figure. But the above examples point to little more than an independence of thought and a refusal to be bound by traditional party lines. The role of an MP is not simply to reflect what the majority of constituents think rather, MPs are elected to exercise judgment and discretion on their constituents’ behalf. And Hoey’s constituents have apparently been perfectly satisfied with her: she increased her majority at the last general election. She has also been a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, something that cannot be said for a fair few of her parliamentary colleagues.In the case of Field, his crime too is to have voted with the Conservatives on Brexit. Never mind that Field and Hoey vote the same way as other Labour MPs on the vast majority of issues, or that Field in particular has a proud history of campaigning against poverty.The manner in which Hoey and Field have been treated seems of a piece with some of the less edifying characteristics of our times. There are increasingly noisy howls on the left and right of British politics to expel those seen as traitors and saboteurs, with only the truest believers worthy of support. And this is dangerous, for it implies a refusal to listen, an absence of doubt, and an intemperance of spirit. Political parties should be examples of breadth, of ersity, of richness, of plurality. They should be theatres of conversation and deliberation they should be a check on the rule of dogma.This is where political parties differ from groups set up to promote single issues. In the case of matters such as racism, sexism and homophobia, there is no scope for compromise nor should we feel the need to agree any sort of deal with fascists. But political parties exist for far more complex purposes, and healthy ones should be mature enough to be able to accommodate people whose views may differ widely, but who seek broadly the same outcome. Surely that is an effective means to counter those forces that seek to ide us, forces that these days are often in the service of profits for social media corporations and power for reactionary politicians.Enthusiasm, fervour and passion are essential and laudable surely no one wants our politics painted in various shades of beige. There is even some evidence that all the fractiousness and polarisation of recent years has been good for democracy. But even with the noblest of intentions, political zeal left untempered can become a dangerous force. Referring to Soviet communism, the Czech-born writer Milan Kundera wrote: “The criminal regimes were made not by criminals, but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise.”We need to learn not just from those with whom we agree, but from those with whom we disagree. We are all wrong, just in different ways. In today’s world, seeking common cause with people who hold different views from ours feels like a subversive act. But that’s what party politics should be all about. So let’s try it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54884a9e743b1644e6d7c73ba76eaf3d377d24a4/0_117_5341_3204/master/5341.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05f9458f28515f3eef9bb6b0e00878a","title":"no bosses managers flat hierachy workplace tech hollywood","story":"Imagine working for a company with no bosses. On your first day, you are given a handbook for new employees. This will be “the greatest professional experience of your life”, you read. “We don’t have any management, and nobody reports to anybody else.” You can decide which projects you work on. If you hate who you’re sitting next to you can simply move – there are wheels on the bottom of your desk to help. The company has some exciting quirks like a massage room, an in-house radical economist, and trips where everyone in the whole company goes on holiday together.This is no fantasy. It’s a computer game development company called Valve. Based in a suburb of Seattle, Valve has produced well-known games such as Half-Life, and a hugely successful digital distribution platform called Steam. It has recently started developing hardware for games developers.In 2012 Valve’s new employee handbook was leaked. Fawning articles about this unique and amazing company appear everywhere from the BBC to Harvard Business Review. Valve’s economist in residence – Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister – appeared on a podcast describing the company’s unique system of rewarding employees.Since then, the glittering aura of Valve’s “no boss” culture has started to fade. In 2013, an ex-employee described how the company had “a pseudo-flat structure”. “There is actually a hidden layer of powerful management structure in the company,” she said, which made it feel “a lot like high school”.Now, five years later, another ex-employee has taken to Twitter to share his thoughts about a nameless company that closely resembles Valve. Rich Geldreich described how the firm would hire employees, make them grand promises, then fire them once they were no longer useful. He described the firm as being run by “barons” – and advises new employees to cosy up to a baron in order to “rapidly up your purge immunity level before the next firing cycle”.Geldreich’s description squares with some reviews of Valve on Glassdoor, a site where staff leave anonymous verdicts on their employers (although it has to be said that many employees like Valve’s culture). One describes the no-boss culture as “only a facade”: “To succeed at Valve you need to belong to the group that has more decisional power and, even when you succeed temporarily, be certain that you have an expiration date. No matter how hard you work, no matter how original and productive you are, if your bosses and the people who count don’t like you, you will be fired soon or you will be managed out.”Geldreich describes a neo-feudal workplace culture of powerful barons who ruthlessly exercise their whims over temporary favourites, then turn on them during the next “head count reduction” exercise.Such endemic uncertainty is not unique to the computer games industry. Jeffrey Pfeffer, of Stanford University, points out that many young employees in the tech industry think there is no hierarchy, their boss is their buddy, and work is fun. This is fantasy, Pfeffer says. The lack of formal rules and hierarchy masks a vicious informal power structure. But unlike good old-fashioned hierarchies, there are few checks and balances in place in flat firms. Powerful “barons” can pursue their caprices with few limitations.The industries with the least in the way of formal rules and regulations are often rife with sexual harassment. In a forthcoming book, Peter Fleming, a business school professor, points out that the wave of scandals triggered by revelations about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged predation is in no small part connected to the highly flexible organisational structures that Hollywood runs on.Like firms, the famously bureaucratic public sector has also fallen for flatness. In place of rules, regulation and evidence, many public agencies have started to look for “passion”, “enthusiasm” and “flexibility”. It might sound great, but the academic and author Paul du Gay warns that it can lead to dangerous and even disastrous results. For instance, the military misadventures of the early 21st century were often due to the passion and enthusiasm of elected officials trumping the formal rules and expertise offered by civil servants and military personnel.Getting rid of formal hierarchies has also proved dangerous in social movements. After spending years in the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s, the American political scientist Jo Freeman warned of the “tyranny of structurelessness”. Although egalitarian and democratic structures have many benefits, she pointed out, structurelessness easily “becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others”. By putting rules and structures in place, you make it clear and transparent how the group or organisation works. The lesson Freeman learned in the early 1970s has been forgotten over and over again.Fantasies of no rules, no bosses and no hierarchies are seductive. Hierarchies can be repressive, rules can be absurd, and bosses can be toxic. But not having these things can be worse.• André Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School in London, is the author of Business Bullshit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a907d78a440509498501f4536f87f5c779a96f/0_108_3055_1833/master/3055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c39cf7dce0c7709b4b48cd81c62cbe8b","title":"outsourced schools parents primary academy trusts","story":"This is a story they don’t want you to know. Much of it had to be prised from the grip of officials in Whitehall and the local town hall. Yet it demands to be told, because it shows how democracy and accountability are being drained from our schools, and how a surreal battle now rages over who knows what’s best for a child: the parents and teachers, or remote officials and financiers.The school in question is Waltham Holy Cross primary in Essex. Helping on a school run last week, I found an entire small world. It was the last day of term, and teachers joined hands to form a human arch. The bell rang and all those leaving to start secondary ran under their teachers’ arms. Parents whooped while staff hugged overwhelmed pupils. There was barely a dry eye in the playground.More than a school, this is a community – yet officials judge it a failure.Just days before last Christmas, when a classroom’s mind is normally on the nativity play, Ofsted inspectors dropped by. Three long months later, they damned Waltham Holy Cross as “inadequate”. In the Conservatives’ “all-out war” on mediocre education, that is all the excuse needed to take it off the local authority and turn it into an academy. A trust called Net Academies will soon turn it into a “model school”.This version of events does not match the views held by any parent I’ve spoken to, nor does it fit the facts brought to light by numerous freedom of information requests. Reported today in a newspaper for the first time, those requests reveal how little say parents and teachers have over the future of their children and school once it is forced to become an academy. In 2016, the then chancellor George Osborne ordered all schools to make the same conversion. Public outrage forced the Tories to back off then, but next time this story could be about your child.Ofsted tells me the allegations are “simply untrue”, and that “inspectors do not go into schools with a preconceived idea of what judgment the school will receive”. Yet last August, a high court judge attacked the department for believing its views “will always be unimpeachable”.Ofsted’s draft report – which only emerged through freedom of information – is shot through with errors. The headteacher is given a new surname and the number of nursery classes somehow halved. When the report was finally published, with its “inadequate” ruling, many parents could not square it with the happy place they knew. “The day we were told, I took my daughter into nursery – and she skipped all the way,” remembers Jayshree Tailor. “Is that a failing school?”True, Waltham Holy Cross had been through rocky times, but over the past few months it has got a new headteacher (“fabulous”, say parents) and some vim. This month’s SAT results for Year 6 show a remarkable double-digit improvement in reading, writing and maths.Once absorbed by an academy, Waltham Holy Cross has no way of returning to local authority control. This is a form of outsourcing, but with even less control than a contract with Carillion.Ignoring my other questions, Net Academies asked why I wanted to know about its top salaries. Public interest, I replied: you’re taking taxpayers’ money to run schools. Stories of lavish pay and expenses are rife in this industry. I received no reply.Those leading the fight against this academisation aren’t politicians or unions, but parents. On being told in March their children’s school was going to be forcibly converted, the meeting exploded. A group of them began firing off freedom of information requests and peppering officials with awkward emails. They have become what one councillor from a neighbouring borough calls “the most dogged parents I have ever come across”.For Shaunagh Roberts, it began when she first looked up Net Academies – and got a jolt. “I just sat there researching for days, wearing the same pair of pyjamas.”She’s been told how Net Academies successfully runs four academies in Harlow, Essex. Two of Net’s seven academies in Warwickshire and Reading have been ranked “inadequate”, a third “requires improvement”. According to the latest Education Policy Institute report, Net Academy Trust is the sixth-worst primary school group in England, falling below even the collapsed Wakefield City Academies Trust.Its board is stuffed with City folk: PFI lawyers, management consultants, accountants – but apparently no working teacher. Even as it drops three of its schools, the trust’s aim is to run 25 to 30 institutions. Waltham Holy Cross will be the latest notch. “My kids are my world – and this school is their world,” Roberts says. “Why should Net spoil that?”Senior staff don’t want Net either. In April, headteacher Erica Barnett sent a heartfelt private letter to the regional schools commissioner at the Department for Education (Dfe), Sue Baldwin, who has ultimate say over her school’s fate. If it must be an academy, Barnett says, at least let it be run by a rival local trust, Vine, which also has an “incredibly strong community feel”. Come visit, she urges the education official: see what a special place we are. Baldwin doesn’t visit. She picks Net Academies. And we have no idea why – despite this being a taxpayer-funded public asset, parents have been given no full reasoning for the decision. Perhaps because there is no good reason. The DfE told me it was because Vine “did not have the same level of capacity” as Net, the group struggling with almost half its schools. Yet the head refers to Baldwin’s “concern” about Vine being a trust of church schools, which Waltham Holy Cross is not (neither Barnett nor Vine see this as a problem). But the letter contains another clue.Faced with potential conflict of interest in other areas, officials would have ensured they were seen to be a million miles away from the decision. What’s most striking about academies is that there appears to be no such pressure – perhaps in part because private meetings between officials and business people allows everything to happen.And the people who know most about what their kids need – the parents and teachers – are shut out.Academisation laughs at the idea that Britain is a modern, transparent democracy. Under it, the needs of the child are trumped by the demands of rightwing ideology. And as Waltham Holy Cross is discovering, it tries to reduce parents and teachers to mere bystanders.Battling that are mothers like Roberts and Tailor. Never the sort to go on marches, they are now activists. They’ve learned about freedom of information, and used it to unearth scandalously bad decisions. They’ve done it in spare minutes, with cracked smartphones and against official condescension. While trying to preserve their children’s school, they have received another education – and taught officials a few things. Watch these women, because I think they might win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de45494411c951bb52bff2cdef8481b8f74c894/0_68_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b880a00fdda291d574960025a1b9dff7","title":"railway privatisation fragmented fiasco chris grayling","story":"Which question is best when something goes wrong? How to put it right, or who to blame? The first makes sense, but the second is more fun. That is why Chris Grayling, the hapless transport secretary, is being cursed by rail commuters from Brighton to Bedford to Blackpool. Today, yet another emergency timetable enters operation on Northern rail, announced with an inaugural cancellation on Preston station.Grayling can no more run a train than run a mile. He has been in the post for two years of ceaseless controversy, but his job is merely to sit tight and fend off incoming fire, directed at his department and an industry that are both woefully unfit for purpose. For some 20 years since 1993, privatisation ran trains with a degree of success, but passengers are now dwindling and rail has hit the buffers.Last December’s timetable fiasco, chiefly in the north-west and south of the country, was the direct result of over-ambitious companies encouraged by government to bid for new franchises with more trains. This depended on Network Rail upgrading track and signalling on time, and on drivers being retrained by a certain deadline. When both were running late last autumn, a coherent company would have backed off fast. Instead, each tier in the industry assumed someone else would catch up – and if not could be blamed or sued. It was precisely the outcome critics of fragmented privatisation feared.In the 1980s, the Treasury thought rail efficiency would flow from replacing a single corporate hierarchy with a mass of internal sub-contracts between government, operators and an infrastructure company. The same principle was applied, by Labour and Tories alike, to the NHS, social benefits, prisons and probation. It went down great in management schools but it was wrong. The rail infrastructure company Railtrack went bankrupt, and its state-owned replacement, Network Rail, under-performed. Operating rail franchises have been vulnerable to fiasco. Whitehall is now more involved in running railways – and subsidising them – than ever under nationalisation.Privatisation has not worked, not because a private company cannot run a railway but because the structure was wrong. Internal contracting and transfer pricing, as the NHS has found, does not suit a fast-moving public service. It corrupts corporate morale, diminishes executive responsibility, and shifts blame on to contracts.Transport ministers, including Grayling, often muse that the railways would run better if each region were entirely in the charge of a single, vertically integrated company. They are right, but no one has the guts to bring it about. What should happen is plain. Network Rail should be broken up, and its assets put under regional operators, with long-term leases from the government. The boards of Virgin, Stagecoach, Arriva and the rest should run every aspect of their service. They could still be private, but “parastatal” – that is, regulated in the public interest.Then, and only then, would we really know who to blame when the trains are late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0748f37dc88169d99fdbc3b831d0192420936132/0_0_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb53082cf3746e1bda595e7855c7e8e","title":"slaves britain human trafficking","story":"“Lucy” was 12 when she was told she was going on holiday with a family friend. She left her village in west Africa, excited to get on a plane for the first time. All was not as it seemed. She was brought to the UK and left in a house with strangers. She was trapped. Men began to visit the house. Day after day, night after night. For months on end, Lucy endured physical and sexual abuse. Finally, she found the chance to run. But, with nowhere to go, she was forced to live rough on the streets.Tragically, Lucy’s story is far from isolated. Human trafficking – for sexual exploitation, forced labour and other modern forms of slavery – is not some foreign evil. It is happening right here, on our doorstep. In fact, in 2017, UK nationals formed the largest number of trafficking victims in the UK. And the matter is only growing more urgent.Thousands of victims are trafficked into slavery in the UK and kept hidden in plain sight, often working seven days a week for little or no pay in nail salons, car washes, building sites, kitchens, factories and farms. They are trapped, abused and exploited, with no hope of returning home to their loved ones. Often, unknowingly, we are contributing towards someone else’s suffering by buying services and products from people living in modern slavery.We can’t leave it to law enforcement to fight human trafficking alone. All of us must stand watch against modern slavery, rooting it out of our communities, leaving no refuge for traffickers. That’s why, with the charity One Family, I created the campaign #HumanToo. Through #HumanToo, One Family is standing in solidarity with victims and survivors, recognising their humanity and asking everyone, everywhere, to be a part of putting an end to trafficking and modern slavery. We are asking people to learn the common signs of trafficking and slavery, and to be vigilant to report suspicious activity to the police to be curious about the businesses they buy from, and use their purchasing power to support those that are upholding human rights.Kevin Hyland OBE, the UK’s inaugural anti-slavery commissioner, said of the campaign: “It is a reminder that this crime impacts society in many different ways. Most of those who perpetrate these crimes do so for financial gain. No matter what business sector or industry the criminals take advantage of to exploit vulnerable people, it is only through collaboration between the community, the private sector, NGOs, statutory agencies, faith groups and government that we will finally eradicate this crime.”As a part of the campaign, actors will be placed in installations across the City of London representing a nail bar, a school (where sometimes cleaners are in fact slaves), a hotel room, a prison and a construction site, to spotlight key industries that people are trafficked into in the UK. Our installations highlight that human trafficking is hidden in plain sight: a dark underworld oozing just beneath the surface of our everyday lives. But together, we can end it.• Hannah Wheatley is a founding director of the charity One Family"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912ce6518db84abe47a6ed7fea053e07b2cadb5c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f17556b9ee7090d64a7c3ae92de0d0","title":"headline shows the seven greatest music venues in the us","story":"From Madison Square Garden out east to the west’s Hollywood Bowl, via New Orleans blues bars and secret Joshua Tree saloons, visit the most important musical addresses in the USConsidering its totemic role in the creation of virtually every form of popular music we listen to today – from hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and soul to house, hardcore punk and good, plain old classic rock – it should come as a surprise to no one that the US is home to a huge share of the world’s most storied music venues.Some of them are famous for their size, scale and setting, while others have entered the popular consciousness for their part in the history and development of certain styles of music. Some of them, too, are sadly no longer with us, such as New York’s CBGB, or may not count as music venues in the formal sense at all – the street corners of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Compton and suburban Atlanta that gave birth to hip-hop come to mind. Whatever your taste or level of music-nerdery may be, one thing is for sure: the seven venues below have all at some point provided the setting for significant moments in US cultural history.To New Yorkers, Madison Square Garden holds a singular place in the city’s imagination. Known to them simply as “the Garden”, this 20,000 capacity venue describes itself, modestly, as “the most famous arena in the world”. Ordinarily, such a claim would hardly be credible but, in the case of Madison Square Garden, it’s more than justified. Consider this: since the current arena opened its doors in 1968 – there had been three previous public venues occupying the same site since 1879 – the Garden has hosted a number of the greatest shows in the history of popular music, including George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 Parliament Funkadelic’s legendary sold-out shows of 1977 and 1978 and, more recently, LCD Soundsystem’s final (or, as it turned out, not so final) show in 2011, which was released the following year as the groundbreaking concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. It might also be worth mentioning that while the Garden doesn’t have an official house act, that bloke from across the Hudson who goes by the name of Bruce Springsteen has played the venue no less than 47 times. The most famous arena in the world? They’re probably right.If Madison Square Garden is the premier indoor concert venue in the US, then Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre would have to be its most spectacular outdoor musical locale. Framed by an enormous angled rock on one side, with stunning views of the rugged mountain terrain on the other, Red Rocks’ unparalleled outdoor setting has been used to a striking effect in concert films over the years, including U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky and Neil Young’s Red Rocks Live. With a capacity of almost 10,000, the otherworldly arena has also hosted legendary performances by REM, Stevie Nicks and, on what must have been a particularly psychedelic night in 1968, Jimi Hendrix and the Soft Machine. This year, its programme of events includes appearances by Jackson Browne, Seal and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as every rapper’s favourite rapper, that inimitable Brooklyn native, Nas.Instantly recognisable for its “shell” of concentric arches over the stage, the Hollywood Bowl is to Angelenos what Madison Square Garden is to New Yorkers. Set in the bowels of the Hollywood Hills – with the Hollywood sign perched not far off in the background – the list of notable pop and rock performances here is too exhaustive to detail, hosting over the years the Beatles, the Doors (both of whom recorded live albums at the site), Kraftwerk, Prince, Black Sabbath and Dolly Parton. But the 17,500 capacity venue isn’t just famous for its live shows this being Hollywood, it has also featured as a location in films as varied as Some Kind of Wonderful, Beaches and Escape From LA.Perhaps no other continuously operating venue in the US has such a mythical status for its role in the history and development of one style of music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. All of the greats (and by that we do mean all) recorded and performed here over the years: Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, Monk, Rollins, Evans, Brubeck, Baker … the list goes on. And for this reason, the Village Vanguard might just be the No 1 place of pilgrimage for jazz lovers in the world. But it is by no means for jazz buffs alone this intimate, 120-seat venue offers an authentic taste of an older New York – as a much a place to sit back with a good martini, take in the portraits of the legends that line the walls and imagine the curlicues of smoke that once rose from the tables and gave this tiny basement club the hazy ambience that jazz venues the world over have sought to replicate.If Nashville is the home of country music, then the closest thing it has to an exact address would be 2,804 Opryland Drive, where you’ll find Grand Ole Opry – a venue that holds roughly the same significance for lovers of country music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. But the Grand Ole Opry is a little bit more than a music venue: taking its name from the weekly concert radio performance, it is also the longest radio broadcast in US history, having first hit the airwaves in 1925, moving between Nashville locations before finally settling in its current, purpose-built venue in 1974. The great names of country and western, from Johnny Cash to Loretta Lynn, and Garth Brooks to Patsy Cline, have all been regulars at the Opry, and some 215 acts have held a coveted Opry membership (a sure sign that you’ve “made it” as a country star) at some point in their careers.Possibly the coolest venue in the US that you’ve never heard of, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s is a dusty saloon bar located in the depths of California’s cowboy country, on the fringe of Joshua Tree national park. The stature and notoriety of Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s has grown rapidly in recent years, since becoming the venue of choice for many an artist booked at the nearby Coachella festival to play a secret little show of their own on the side. Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritualized, Sonic Youth, Lorde and – pause – Paul McCartney have all passed through for a jam at some point. Oh, and it’s also home to a fully preserved cowboy and western film set out the back, complete with the facades of a local bank, chapel and saloon, which served as the location for dozens of films and television programmes in its 1950s heyday.No list of the US’s great music venues would be complete without at least one entry from New Orleans – and given that it is the home of the legendary Preservation Hall, competition was stiff. But we all know that they do things a little bit differently south of the Mason-Dixon line, and nowhere down south does that hold truer than in New Orleans, so it only seems fitting to choose Kermit’s Treme Mother-in-Law Lounge – one of the most magnificently eccentric music spots in the city. Set up by 60s R\u0026ampB legend and self-proclaimed “emperor of the universe” Ernie K-Doe, the lounge hosts local jazz, funk and legendarily swampy Louisiana blues performances week in, week out, and is as famous for the mind-bending murals that adorn its exterior walls as it is for its raucous shows and southern soul food.United Airlines flies from four UK airports to key US hubs, with onward connections to more than 280 destinations across the Americas.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

Retailers will have to decide whether to pass such rises on to consumers.Following the year’s wet and cold spring, many livestock farmers have had to dip into their stores of winter feed early, said Robert Martin, who keeps a 120-strong herd of dairy cattle near Carlisle. “Milk yields are down because of the conditions,” he added. “People are coming to market early with cattle because they can’t afford to carry passengers.”The next few months would be crucial, he said. “Brassicas, such as broccoli and cabbage, are down in volume. With salad, growers are having difficulty just keeping the plants alive. But there is still time for potatoes to bulk up, and onions,” he said. “That will depend on the weather in August and September.”Many farmers are having to harvest crops, particularly grain, early this year because the hot conditions have caused them to ripen sooner, but without time to “bulk up” to their usual size. This is likely to depress the yield on such crops, which could in turn raise prices.The widespread nature of the heatwave across Europe and beyond would mean retailers cannot simply pick up cheaper food elsewhere to put on their shelves, said Liz Bowles, head of farming at the Soil Association. “Many food exporter regions around the globe are being affected, so we could see pressure on prices for consumers,” she said.Farm economics are also much affected by the weak pound, added Dossa, which he called a “double-edged sword”, because while it makes exports more profitable, it raises the cost of inputs such as feed, fuel and fertiliser. Meanwhile, the uncertainty over Brexit has resulted in a slump in confidence among farmers, with the NFU’s latest survey in April showing confidence at its lowest in eight years. Low confidence translates to lower investment, which could have a long-term dampening effect on productivity.Farmers are used to dealing with the vagaries of the weather, but the long winter and cold spring, followed by the heatwave, has produced a meteorological double whammy that has sent many reeling. That would have been bad enough, but the added effects of Brexit are creating turmoil. Thomas said: “Reacting to what the elements throw at you is part of a farmer’s life, and most accept that. However, extreme weather creates extreme challenges that make it impossible to plan for anything. There’s already tremendous uncertainty about the future due to Brexit and the implications of a possible no deal outcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f59b075b51d0fe4e9f261c482979715f7496a025/0_0_7160_4296/master/7160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7df3a066c87337ad2abb82f40ef8904","title":"this one has heat stress the shocking reality of live animal exports","story":"The global demand for meat means more animals are moved around the world than ever before. Activists say the conditions they endure are intolerable – and we are all turning a blind eyeAt the Kapikule border crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, Lesley Moffat charges forward, clipboard in hand, marching alongside the parked lorries loaded with live cows and sheep waiting in this no man’s land to be exported from the EU. Sometimes, the animals are left on the lorries for days, stuck inside metallic freight containers barely shielded from the blinding sun as truckers, bureaucrats, importers and exporters haggle over paperwork and fees.The cows struggle to bring their heads close to the fresh air. Their containers are filled with urine and manure, levels of ammonia steadily rising inside the trailers as journeys wear on. Moffat – the founder of the Dutch-based charity Eyes on Animals – sticks her hand through the grating of one lorry to check the animals’ water supply. “Look at this,” she says, grabbing at the hay stuck into the water trough and pointing to the dung clogging it. “It gets full of dirty straw and shit, and they can never drink from it,” she says. “The drivers need to give them water in buckets.”She whips out an electronic thermometer holstered in her satchel and sticks it through the grates. She notes the temperature – over 30C, higher than EU regulations – and jots it down on her checklist as she moves from truck to truck, petting some of the distressed animals on their snouts and even pouring water out of her own bottle for the parched cows. “This one is showing signs of heat stress – its tongue is rolling,” she says, pointing to a cow inside one of the trucks.For years, she says, authorities have promised to build a shaded grazing area for animals waiting at the border, even showing plans for where the facility is meant to go up. But nothing has happened. “Every year, it’s the same situation here,” she says. “Trucks are arriving when it’s over 30C, even though that’s illegal. There’s just one fire hydrant, no shade, no infrastructure, trucks waiting in the sun all day.”Demand for meat is rising all over the world, even as the industry faces challenges from animal-rights activists and burgeoning vegetarian and vegan lifestyles in the west. The live export business is thriving. At every moment of the day, animals are being moved huge distances across the planet’s surface. Horses from the US are packed on to transport trucks and sent to be slaughtered in Mexico. Pigs from Canada endure icy temperatures as they wait for long periods at the US frontier. Livestock from central Europe is trucked to the farthest reaches of Russia, where they are slaughtered, fattened or bred. Cows from Australia, Uruguay and Argentina are loaded on to ships and endure weeks-long trips to the Middle East.The trade makes economic sense, catering to people, such as those in Turkey, who are willing to pay a premium for imported meats because they consume far more than they produce. Live animal exports reduce the need to install expensive equipment to keep meat frozen. The EU imports large amounts of fruit and vegetables, and live animal exports help to plug the trade gap.What’s more, butchers in Muslim countries demand newly slaughtered lamb and beef. “It has to do with the meat consumption culture,” says Jean-Luc Mériaux, the secretary general of the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union (UECBV), a Brussels-based lobbying group that argues the export trade makes an important contribution to the EU’s economy. “They’re looking for very fresh meat, they eat it immediately after the slaughtering. And if we don’t supply the cattle, someone else will – maybe Brazil, Uruguay or Australia.”But the trade raises some uncomfortable ethical questions. Here at the TurkeyBulgaria border, the bottleneck where so many animals leave the EU for Turkey and the Middle East, many of the cows are crammed into quarters so tight that they are unable to lie down. Eerily, few of them moo, a possible sign of exhaustion. One cow is bleeding from a raw stump where her horn caught in the railing of the truck and was ripped off.Moffat is a blur of activity here, talking to truck drivers, trying to offer care for the animals as much as she is able. When she spots a newborn calf in distress (the calf was probably born in transit), she summons a vet from the nearby city of Edirne in north-west Turkey and pays for medical treatment.Moffat is the granddaughter of cattle farmers in Ontario. They treated their 40 or so cows well, but as a child she watched as global agribusiness moved in and set up industrial conditions for livestock that she considered unbearable for the animals and unhealthy for people consuming their meat. “I learned about factory farming as a 12-year-old,” she says. “It made me an activist right away.”Now, she physically chases down traders and trucks, often trailing cars for miles, keeping track of how they treat the animals under their care. Her scariest experience came in 2005, while monitoring a businessman in rural Belgium. She was watching him load donkeys on to a truck from across a field. He spotted her. She ran back to her car and he followed with a baseball bat, which he used to smash her car. She sped away with the man in pursuit. “I’ve never driven so fast,” she says. “I was going through these tiny towns at 180kmh.” She finally parked in front of a cafe and called out for help.Most encounters are far less confrontational. During the hours we spend at the border, several truckers whom Moffat awakens from their naps agree to turn on the fans installed inside the trailers when she points out the temperatures. Others promise to water the animals while waiting for customs papers to come through. Moffat is sympathetic to the plight of the drivers, many of whom would be working in agricultural jobs were it not for the rise of industrial farming. Many of the truckers voice sympathy for the animals and seem eager to cooperate.“They’re not the ones with the big money,” she says. “They’re not the bosses. They’re forced to drive really long hours, long distances alone, which is illegal, but saves the boss money.”This is just one of the frontlines on which activists around the world have fought for years. In the 90s, widespread protests in the UK dominated the press. In 1995, a 31-year-old animal rights activist, Jill Phipps, was crushed to death by a lorry during a protest against export of live calves to the Netherlands. The subject has come to the fore because of the Brexit discussions, with Michael Gove, the UK’s environment secretary, consulting on banning livestock exports after the country leaves the EU. It is a move that would not be allowed under EU trading rules. New Zealand has been operating a de facto ban on exports for slaughter since 2003, while activists in Australia are now seeking a ban after using undercover footage to expose the abuses they say go on inside the ships carrying farm animals for slaughter around the world. Cows, they say, are held in containers that fill up with tens of thousands of litres of urine and faeces during hot, weeks-long journeys.Animal rights advocates insist the trade in live animals is unnecessary and that animals should be raised closer to where they are eaten, or slaughtered and exported as frozen carcasses. “We want to end this cruel and completely outdated trade,” says Reineke Hameleers, the director of Eurogroup for Animals. “Animals are not goods. They are beings.” Jørn Dohrmann, a Danish member of the European parliament who is serving as rapporteur on live animal exports, says the EU should refuse to sell animals to countries when they might be subjected to abuse.Activists say that guidelines laid down by the EU and member states are quickly discarded from the moment animals are herded on to lorries or ships operated by giant firms. “They can’t move,” says Francesca Porta, of Eurogroup for Animals. “If they fall down, they cannot get up. They are exhausted because the length of journey is very long. They don’t have water, feed, or resting time. For unweaned animals in particular, the mortality rate is high.” The EU is keenly aware of the controversy and is preparing an assessment of how its rules are being implemented, which should be ready by January 2019. Dohrmann travelled to Turkey this month to see the treatment of animals at the border. “I think the European commission is weak on this question,” he says. “You have 28 different set of rules they are not implemented in the same way in each country.”The UECBV insists that the industry abides by strict national and European commission legal requirements, while acknowledging occasional “shortcomings” and room for improvement. Mériaux says companies that don’t abide by the rules are not able to operate. “Try to load a truck in France or Ireland in the summer and you will not get permission to go to Turkey because the temperatures are too high,” he says. “You are told to wait a couple of weeks.”Industry advocates even argue that the activists’ actions lead to unintended consequences. Kirk Leech, executive director of the London-based advocacy group the European Animal Research Association, cites the example of a Dutch company forced to use a rusting, dilapidated Russian tank ferry to move sheep from the coast of Kent to France for halal slaughter because no other shipping firm will move live animals.“Because the activists made a big campaign about this, they have forced potentially better transport providers such as Eurotunnel not to touch it,” he says. “Eurotunnel moves tanks, alcohol and cigarettes, but they won’t touch animals for food consumption or research purposes because they fear the reputational consequences.”Only Air France and a few charter planes will fly live animals for research or consumption. Leech cites the case of live animals that needed to travel 300km within Portugal from Lisbon to Porto, but had to be flown via Frankfurt, putting additional stress on the creatures, because the Portuguese national carrier refuses to carry research animals.Moffat is familiar with these arguments. She admits that sometimes they win and sometimes they lose. “You’ve got to start somewhere, and when it gets cleaned up in one area, it gets a little dirtier in the other area,” she says. She is not about to give up any time soon, though. “It doesn’t matter that these animals are ultimately headed for slaughter,” she says. “Anything that has the desire to live and feels pain we should think twice about making suffer. I see it as enlarging the circle of compassion to include all things that feel pain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea30ee4c2bd66440b3418e60361bac52fdc401a0/0_133_750_937/master/750.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b61c245eb164f397869a063f4edd67b 880w","title":"forest green rovers named worlds first un certified carbon neutral football club","story":"Gloucestershire-based League Two club powered by renewable energy and endorsed by Vegan SocietyA British professional football club that is powered by renewable energy and serves vegan food to players, staff and fans has received a prestigious United Nations certification.Forest Green Rovers, which plays in League Two, announced on Monday that it has become the world’s first UN certified carbon-neutral football club.Based in the Gloucestershire town of Nailsworth, the club has signed up for a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initiative called Climate Neutral Now for the 2018-19 season.FGR’s green credentials have been attracting attention around the world for several years.

It could be bumpy at the start and fans have no option but to trust in the new man writers’ predicted position: 5th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 20-1The first thing to make clear is that the man charged with reviving Arsenal is not the Spanish equivalent of David Moyes. The second is that for any comparison with Manchester United’s struggle to adapt to life after Sir Alex Ferguson to hold, Arsène Wenger would have had to leave his successor a title-winning team, rather than one that failed to win an away game in 2018 until the final day of last season.If Unai Emery’s task is daunting, it is only because the previous boss was well past his glorious peak. Whereas United’s travails since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013 have exposed their structural failings, the unfortunate truth is that decay had taken hold at Arsenal long before the announcement of Wenger’s departure on 20 April. The folly of telling the Wenger Out brigade to be careful what they wished for whenever dissatisfaction rose had become impossible to ignore.How, after all, did it make sense for Arsenal to turn a blind eye to Wenger’s decline simply because United hired Moyes? It was a disingenuous argument, a counterproductive way of thinking and a waste of time. As long as the status quo remained in place, there was no way for Arsenal to make real progress.The price of inertia is that the squad Wenger left behind was the worst of his 22-year reign, which at least means that Emery can start with expectations at a realistic level. Arsenal missed out on Champions League qualification again last season and they will have to re-establish themselves in the top four before thinking about winning their first title since 2004.That explains why there was little grumbling when Wenger left with a year remaining on his contract. It will be strange not to see the Frenchman in the dugout when Manchester City visit the Emirates on the opening weekend but the time had come for Arsenal to innovate – and it is telling that Emery’s title is head coach, with Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat placed in charge of transfers. This project is Ivan Gazidis’s baby. The club’s chief executive, who was linked with a move to Milan last week, finds himself in a strong position in north London, having found a manager willing to work under his structure.Crucially, Arsenal have had a while to adjust. Emery was in place less than a fortnight after Wenger’s final game, allowing the Spaniard a full summer to work with his new squad, and it will be fascinating to see if the 46-year-old is capable of invigorating a team who have been crying out for more direction. Vague tactics have led to Arsenal becoming flimsy, immature and prone to collapse at the first sign of trouble.While it might have been braver for them to press ahead with their early interest in Mikel Arteta, who has received quite the education as part of Pep Guardiola’s entourage at City, it is worth keeping in mind that the 36-year-old would have been learning on the job. Could Arsenal afford a gamble when they have already fallen so far behind their rivals? Not when Emery was regarded as the safer choice.Perhaps that does not reflect too well on Arsenal. They have gone for experience but they have not appointed a sure thing. Emery is not a genius like Guardiola, a forceful personality like Jürgen Klopp or a ruthless winner like José Mourinho. He has won more than Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino and Chelsea’s Maurizio Sarri, true, but even his achievement of leading Paris Saint-Germain to a domestic treble last season comes with the caveat that he lost the title to Monaco in his first season in France and made no impression in the Champions League.Equally, however, PSG’s financial advantage can magnify their setbacks. Perhaps it was the wrong fit for Emery. His reputation as a demanding football obsessive might have stopped him from connecting with PSG’s egotists but it has helped him flourish in less suffocating environments. The experience of achieving three consecutive Europa League triumphs at Sevilla should prove helpful as Arsenal prepare for another Thursday-Sunday schedule.Above all, Arsenal have turned to a coach who will work relentlessly on his players’ weaknesses, which should benefit stagnating youngsters such as Héctor Bellerín, Calum Chambers, Rob Holding and Alex Iwobi. There will be more intensity and Emery, who seems likely to favour a 4-2-3-1 system, has spoken about shifting the emphasis from dominating possession to showing remorseless hunger off the ball.A new Arsenal are gradually starting to take form. There has been no major clear-out yet – Jack Wilshere has moved to West Ham after being told his opportunities would be limited and Santi Cazorla has returned to Villarreal in search of a fresh start – but the tweaks Emery has made so far show where he wants to improve.The arrival of Stephan Lichtsteiner, the experienced Swiss right-back, on a free transfer from Juventus should harden a naive side, while Arsenal have looked to toughen their soft centre with the £17.7m signing of the Greece centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund and the £26.5m signing of the talented Uruguayan midfielder Lucas Torreira from Sampdoria. Bernd Leno is expected to take the No1 spot from Petr Cech after joining from Bayern Leverkusen for £19.2m, while Mattéo Guendouzi, a 19-year-old French midfielder, is one for the future after signing for £7m from Lorient.That, however, is that as far as new signings are concerned. Funds are limited, meaning that Arsenal have required a focused approach, and Emery could find himself itching to replace a few members of his squad soon.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette could form a potent partnership in attack, Aaron Ramsey offers goals and energy from midfield and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson and Konstantinos Mavropanos showed promise last season. However, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Mesut Özil are not as consistent as their equivalents elsewhere, Danny Welbeck has struggled to stay fit, Granit Xhaka can be rash in central midfield, Shkodran Mustafi has toiled at centre-back, Laurent Koscielny is injured and Sead Kolasinac and Nacho Monreal are unconvincing options at left-back. There are holes to fill and a lack of quality depth.Framed in that way, Emery has his work cut out and it remains to be seen if Arsenal have made up enough ground on their rivals. These, ultimately, are uncertain times in north London and it will only take a couple of bad results for people to start questioning the wisdom of parting with Wenger. But there is no going back, no room for doubt or panic, even if it is painful at first. In Ivan, Raúl, Sven and Unai they have to trust. They have no other option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b645e1eeb2ecdbca84ce70910a8b57853958062/0_291_6282_3770/master/6282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76560efa18f18f7b8bff9dbbc3e9408","title":"seven ways to manage asthma","story":"One in 12 adults in the UK have asthma, but although it is a long-term condition, doctors now believe that, with the right precautions, most people can live active livesAsthma attacks kill three people every day in the UK, but two-thirds of these deaths are thought to be preventable. Asthma symptoms can be controlled with inhalers and oral medications, but, in case you have a severe attack, it is advisable to have a reliever inhaler on hand as it can act rapidly to relax straining airways. If you have to use a reliever inhaler three times a week or more, this is a sign that your asthma isn’t well managed and you should see your doctor to review your medication regime.Everyone with asthma has certain environmental triggers that make them susceptible to an attack. Record the things that could be making your symptoms worse and work out strategies for avoiding them. Common culprits include mould, tobacco smoke and air pollution.Various studies have found that obesity may result in more severe asthma symptoms and can even trigger the onset of the disease. The link isn’t fully understood, but scientists think it is because the condition is triggered by inflamed and swollen airways and many obese iniduals have chronic low-grade inflammation.Dusting and vacuuming rooms twice a week (while wearing a filter mask), using high-efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filters to keep the indoor air clean, and washing bedding weekly can lead to an improvement in symptoms. Using anti-dust mite covers on mattresses and pillows can reduce contact with microscopic creatures, present in dust, which can trigger an attack.Some asthmatics are very sensitive to the proteins in flakes of skin from animals, which can cause the immune system to overreact and trigger an attack. If you still want to keep a pet, grooming and bathing it frequently can help to reduce the likelihood of a reaction. Discuss using a nasal spray to control allergic symptoms with your doctor or asthma nurse.Research suggests that a regular programme of breathing exercises, such as the Papworth and Buteyko methods can improve quality of life and reduce the need to use a reliever inhaler. However, these are complementary therapies that should be used alongside medication, not as a replacement.Asthmatics can exercise. After all, Paul Scholes and Paula Radcliffe are just two examples of elite athletes who have asthma. Exercise is often good for asthmatics as it improves lung efficiency and boosts the immune system. However, if you haven’t exercised for a while, or have been experiencing regular attacks, it is best to stick to moderate aerobic exercises, such as walking, yoga or swimming (although the chlorine in swimming pools can trigger an asthma attack in some people)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b50e3c036fb31e3821144ccef610041ab035869/0_1057_6775_4066/master/6775.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c002f807cb602d87c28f9cc90c3a05","title":"thomasina miers recipe for roasted aubergine and tomato salad with black beans","story":"Fresh oregano lends a robust flavour to this smoky dish, tossed with a refreshing salsaHave you noticed there’s a quiet vinegar revolution happening?

Roast for 35-40 minutes, until soft and caramelised, stirring a couple of times during the cooking.Meanwhile, melt the butter and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large casserole dish, then add the onion. Sweat over a medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the lardons. Finely chop the remaining garlic cloves, add to the pan, turn up the heat a little and cook for another five minutes, until the fat has rendered out of the bacon. Add the black beans, bay leaves and remaining chipotle or paprika, cook for a few minutes, then add 200ml water and stir. Cook for 10 minutes to allow all the flavours to mingle – this gets better if you leave it to mature overnight.When you are ready to eat, blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain and peel. Cut them into wedges, then into cubes, and toss with the onion, lime juice, coriander and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and add a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are lacking flavour. Toss the aubergine with the tomato salsa and check for seasoning – add one to two teaspoons of vinegar for acidity.Serve the black beans in a bowl or platter topped with the aubergine and the fresh tomato salsa. If you prefer, crumble over some lancashire cheese or feta, but I like it as is.I love to toss the aubergine salad into warm Camargue red rice, quinoa or couscous for part of a meze spread. It is also delicious with a whole roast fish. The beans are a favourite at Wahaca – serve them with anything from barbecued chops, grilled lobster, chorizo oil or just a drizzle of sour cream and a grating of sheeps’ cheese."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20fda54290041652957c7d687edce053ef477c18/192_252_4521_2916/master/4521.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f1715a7a37639be7707adabda2d4feb","title":"how was your weekend running","story":"Why don’t more women try track racing? Someone has to keep me company, folks ... As always, share your weekend triumphs and flops below the line It will come as no surprise to regulars when I say that I love the track. Track sessions, mostly on my own, twice a week, are the bread and butter of my training. But I also love a track race: and I wish more people did them.Of course I know that it’s not always possible, practical or accessible for many people to enter track races. But I also know that lots of people simply don’t realise they exist - exist, that is, at a fairly local, low key level organised by running clubs and certainly not only for ‘elite’ runners. That you don’t need to be Laura Muir or Chris O’Hare to toe the start line, and that testing yourself over a short distance on the track is both hideously painful, and a whole lot of fun.On Friday night I took part in the Soar Mile - a series of graded mile races (times ranging from just over four minutes to just under eleven) on the London Community Track - or, as it used to be know, the Olympic warm up track. Just before the races started, the skies opened and torrential rain threatened to turn the races into 1609 metre swims. But we were lucky, the clouds passed on, and the track soon dried up. As each group did their best four laps, other runners gathered in lane three to cheer them round - beer in hand if their race was already done. It’s the first time I’ve done a mile race with such a closely grouped field - for the first two laps I felt completely boxed in, nearly got tripped twice, and was frustrated at what seemed like too slow a pace. Ah, mile racing. How quickly “This is too slow!” turns into “My lungs are on fire!”. Having managed to forget my Garmin, I’ve no idea what my lap times were but I suspect my attempt to really put the hammer down on lap three may have been a tad over enthusiastic, resulting in a ‘running through treacle backwards’ lap four. Mind you, if the last 400m of a mile race doesn’t feel like that, you’ve not gone hard enough. As my coach, Tom, messaged me before the race, “Racing a mile is like being a boxer: if you don’t want to get punched in the face and hurt, don’t get in the ring!”. At any rate, the cheers from lane three and the great atmosphere definitely helped me to my fastest ever mile (5min 37sec: I did once run a 5min 35sec mile on the road but I remain unconvinced it was properly measured!). And on Wednesday I’m toeing the track line again for an open 3,000m. Glutton for track punishment, me.But do have a look into your local clubs and see if there’s something that takes your fancy. These events thrive on enthusiastic runners and volunteers - and one thing they really, really need is more women. When I do a road race, I look around and the gender split seems roughly even. When I look at a track race, it’s often a couple of women and a hundred blokes. The Soar mile races were a happy exception to this - but check this out for a depressing gender split (13 women out of 150 entries). Lets do something about that, ladies!So, over to you. How was your weekend running - did you race, enjoy the relatively cooler weather or are you starting to think about autumn races and goals?

Simon Fox, chief executive of Reach, said the write-down reflected the poor long-term outlook for print sales and readership, not digital opportunity for local titles.“It is about the print assets,” he said. “In terms of our regional digital strategy we are going into cities where we never had a print presence, like Leeds, and we are about to open in Edinburgh. Those are unrelated to the print assets we hold.”Fox said national newspaper ad revenues were down “low single digit” – a major improvement compared with last year – thanks to heavy World Cup advertising and some of the major supermarkets returning to print advertising.Overall, Reach reported £173.8m in charges that included £8m in restructuring, covering costs such as the job cuts following the Express takeover, and £7.5m to top its fund for settling historical phone hacking claims against its newspapers. The company said it expects to make £18m in cost savings for the full year – up from a previous target of £15m. By 2020, the company expects to have made £20m savings from the business, with £12m of that coming from editorial.“We have delivered a positive financial performance in what remains a difficult trading environment for the industry, in particular the regional businesses,” said Fox. “The benefit of improved performance from national print advertising coupled with further cost mitigation will support profits over the year despite a further increase in newsprint prices for the second half.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58da9281b16834ced0970df969922ff5cd661a9c/63_0_2937_1762/master/2937.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b338443446a9bcb8e31ce3681de2db7f","title":"help to buy scheme new build interest rates","story":"Help-to-buy is not an option if you don’t want a new-build home – and interest rates can be higherQ In your opinion is help-to-buy a good option?

A stickler in some matters, Smyth was subversive in others. In her Mass in D, originally conceived in 1891, she chose to have the Gloria close the sequence of movements, and conducted it that way in the 1928 Three Choirs festival. Ninety years on, artistic director Geraint Bowen’s performance with the Festival chorus and orchestra-in-residence, Philharmonia, honoured Smyth’s intention of a glorious culminating finale, with its momentary references to Beethoven’s Ninth and the affirming joy of D major.Division of the text and word-setting is unconventional, the word Crucifixus repeated over and over, passed through the choral voices as though beads on a rosary. Overall scoring is similarly unusual and, in the Agnus Dei, the mezzo-soprano combined with horns and tuba to create a mellow richness. Soloists Eleanor Dennis, Madeleine Shaw, Paul Nilon and Neal Davies reflected well the often operatic style, a reminder that Mahler planned to stage an opera of hers in Vienna. While complemented here by John Ireland’s These Things Shall Be, Smyth’s Mass had given Geraint Bowen his starting point for a whole festival celebrating women and, in an earlier afternoon recital, Trio Dali played trios by Clara Schumann, Lili Boulanger and Rebecca Clarke.

She said: “We do not act in donors’ interests, except to the extent that they have an interest in pursuing free trade and free markets.” She added it makes “independent editorial decisions and then seeks funding ... it is surely uncontroversial that the IEA’s principles coincide with the interests of our donors”.The thinktank said it was “spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Littlewood said: “We want politicians to listen to us. I don’t apologise for that.” When asked whether the IEA was sufficiently blind to the interests of its donors, he said: “We have to find people with whom we have synergy. We have to raise money from companies, iniduals, foundations.”The Institute of Economic Affairs was established in 1955 by admirers of the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek. Its mission involves “analysing and expounding the role of markets in solving economic and social problems”.\u0026nbspIn July it launched a £50,000 prize for ideas about harnessing the free market to solve the UK’s housing crisis. It is established as an educational charity and does not have to declare its donors, although it is widely known to have been backed by tobacco, alcohol and oil companies, among others. It publishes reports, and organises conferences and dinners that are often attended by government ministers as well as donors. It has a high media profile, regularly supplying spokespeople to TV news channels.Last year it spent £2.3m on its activities, which include distributing a magazine about economics to thousands of A-level students.Its trustees include Patrick Minford, a pro-Brexit economics professor who supported Margaret Thatcher, and the hedge fund billionaire and Conservative party donor Sir Michael Hintze.\u0026nbspThe IEA was established in 1955 and is one of the most influential rightwing thinktanks operating in the UK and operates with a annual budget of £2.3m.Purkis said the IEA appeared to be “promoting particular free trade policy prescriptions, which is not compatible with being an educational charity”.“To be an educational charity, you must not be promoting a controversial, predetermined position,” Purkis said. “Instead, you should be presenting facts and arguments in a balanced and neutral way, allowing the reader to reach his or her own conclusion.”Trickett’s letter to Lady Stowell, the chair of the Charity Commission, said that “contrary to assurances the IEA previously gave the regulator that funders could not affect the contents of papers or other research output, it has privately indicated that potential sponsors could influence the content of report, ensuring the report is ‘salient’ to their business concerns”.“The system is clearly not working if a registered charity, supposedly prohibited in law from having a political purpose, uses foreign money to lobby politicians to support its extreme political agenda,” Trickett told the , which first reported the investigation by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigations unit, on Sunday.Asked about this, the IEA said Singham was “quite clearly not ‘writing Gove’s script’ given the significant ergence in their opinions” on issues such as leaving the customs union.The Charity Commission investigated the IEA in 2016, following an earlier complaint by Purkis. At that time, it concluded that “the only sponsored research IEA accepts is from iniduals or trusts who do not have a vested or commercial interest in the topic” and that “the sponsorship only goes as far as suggesting topics, not the contents of the paper”. It also said that the IEA’s trustees assured it that it does not engage in “policy engineering” or “campaigning”.Responding to the Greenpeace investigation, Purkis said: “Offering donor access to ministers is a practice more closely associated with commercial lobbyingPR companies or raising funds for political parties rather than charities, but charity fundraisers do quite frequently offer donors access to their patrons and celebrity supporters.“The more serious aspect for the Charity Commission may be the focus on influencing current policymaking in a particular direction, whether directly or via donors with access, which is not what educational charities should be doing. Littlewood talks about the IEA’s ‘ideological position’, which to some may suggest a closed world view that the IEA is trying to promote. Educational charities should not be promoting an ideology.”He continued: “The reference to donors being able to influence ‘substantial content’, though not conclusions, adds to the worries that the public’s trust and confidence in charities as existing solely for the public benefit can be endangered if charity reports are perceived to be ‘substantially influenced’ by big donors – who may represent particular private interests and whose identity, in the case of IEA, is often secret.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a43b1cdbdec97ceed41a5eb273d12f99bdd180e9/0_96_4214_2529/master/4214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d751225b0e6e573dfc378650374e5cf","title":"origin of the species where did darwins finches come from","story":"Galápagos finches have been the subject of a plethora of evolutionary studies, but where did the first ones come from?When the first of the Galápagos Islands arose from the ocean floor around 3m years ago, they were naked, angry, lava-spewing cones devoid of life. Now, millions of years later, they are alive with some of the world’s most iconic animals. Giant tortoises. Sea iguanas. Flightless cormorants. And those finches equipped with Swiss army knife beaks.The Galápagos finches are probably one of the most well-known examples of evolution and will forever be tightly linked to Charles Darwin’s voyage and his theory of natural selection (although you may be surprised to learn that the Galápagos finches were not as central to Darwin’s theory as we like to think). With their ersity of bill sizes and shapes, each species has adapted to a specific type of food the ground-finch (Geospiza) has a thick beak adapted to feeding on a variety of crunchy seeds and arthropods, whereas the warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) developed a slender, pointy bill to catch tasty insects hiding between the foliage. The woodpecker finch (Camarhynchus pallidus) even uses twigs or cactus spines to pry arthropods out of treeholes.The Galápagos finches are seen as a classic example of an adaptive radiation, the rapid evolution of ecologically different species from a common ancestor. Comparisons of anatomical features of the Galápagos finches, as well as modern molecular techniques, show they are indeed more closely related to each other than to any other species. This means they form a monophyletic group, a group of organisms all descended from one ancestral species. Based on the accumulated differences that occurred in their DNA over time (a way of estimating when species split from each other), the ancestral flock likely reached the Galápagos about 2-3m years ago (Grant and Grant, 2008). What did those very first finches look like? And where did they come from?Although many of the Galápagos Islands themselves are several million years old, the oldest known fossil remains of Galápagos finches come from the Holocene period (the last 10,000 years) (Steadman et al, 1991). These fossils are from two species of ground-finches, Geospiza nebulosi and G magnirostris, that are still living on the islands today. They thus tell us little about what the earliest finches looked like and where they might have come from.Because of the islands’ close proximity to Ecuador, scientists have looked towards mainland South America in their search for the ancestor of the Galápagos finches. The avian palaeontologist David Steadman argued, based on morphological and behavioural similarities (1982), that the blue-back grassquit Volatinia jacarina, a small tropical bird common throughout much of Central and South America, was the most likely direct ancestor of the Galápagos finches. Later studies, such as that of Sato et al. (2001), started using mitochondrial DNA and found that another species of grassquit, Tiaris obscura, was the most likely ancestral species. This species originated in Central America, but spread into South America as the Isthmus of Panama, the land bridge between North and South America, formed around 3m years ago. From South America, it made its way to the archipelago.However, others have argued, based on similarities in morphology as well as behaviour, that the Galápagos finches are more closely related to Caribbean species of Tiaris or the Saint Lucia black finch Melanospiza richardsoni (Baptista and Trail, 1988). This possibility of a Caribbean origin of the Galápagos finches was also corroborated by a recent analysis (Funk and Burns, 2018). In this analysis, the majority of species most closely related to the Galápagos finches were found to have their ancestral range in the Caribbean. However, the analysis was not conclusive, and there remains an equal probability of a Caribbean origin or a South American mainland origin to the Darwin’s finch radiation. A Caribbean origin of the Galápagos finches seems counterintuitive, as the nearest mainland from the Galápagos is South America, but dispersal does not always follow a straight line. This is nicely demonstrated by the finch that inhabits nearby Cocos Island, Pinaroloxias inornata. Although this island is closer to the mainland than the Galápagos Islands themselves, genetic research has shown that the Cocos Island finch descended from a Galápagos species, not a mainland one (Grant and Grant, 2008).Birds are excellent long-distance dispersers, even over open ocean, as demonstrated by the repeated colonisation of the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand. Moreover, other Galápagos birds, such as mockingbirds and the Galápagos flamingo, exhibit similar Caribbean connections, indicating that a Caribbean origin is plausible. Remarkably enough, this pattern has also been found in other animal groups, such as snakes, moths and sponges (Grehan 2001). Thus the Caribbean remains as a likely source for the origin of Galápagos finches.Although the lack of fossils means that we don’t know much about the appearance of the first finches, we can narrow down their area of origin. The closure of the Panama land bridge altered ocean circulation, and probably brought about changes in wind strength and directions. These changes may have facilitated the colonisation of the Galápagos Islands, especially if that area was the point of departure for a flock of adventurous finches.Baptista, LF, and Trail, PW, 1988.

The British driver won the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday and now enjoys a 24-point lead over his title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel. However he warned that the Scuderia had the quicker car, a view backed by an optimistic Vettel.Hamilton won in Hungary after a dominant run from pole position, a big win for Mercedes at a track where they had expected to be weak, the proliferation of slow to medium-speed corners not playing to the strengths of the W09 car. The victory completes a remarkable turnaround for Hamilton over the last two races. At the previous round in Germany he came from 14th to win, while Vettel made an error and crashed out. The lead has changed hands six times this season but the 31-point swing in Hamilton’s favour since Hockenheim has given him the largest lead either driver has enjoyed as F1 heads into the summer break.It has been far from plain sailing however. Hamilton has suffered from three mechanical setbacks and three poor strategy calls, but the British driver believes his team have still had the edge.“This year Ferrari really do have the upper hand pace-wise,” he said. “But I think all around, as a whole, we have hopefully done a slightly better job. We’ve got work to do, we’ve got things to improve. We’ve got to try and catch them – but we’ve got to continue to keep rising with all the other elements, which allows us to beat Ferrari when they don’t bring their A-game.”The Ferrari has demonstrated superior pace in the last two races and the Scuderia has clearly stolen a march in engine development. Given that their car has been the better of the two this season, Vettel could have expected to be in front at this stage but in the opening 12 races he has made four mistakes that have cost him points. He took a grid penalty for impeding Carlos Sainz in qualifying at the Red Bull Ring. In Baku he lost places, too aggressive on the restart, in France he clipped Valtteri Bottas in turn one and then went off into the barriers in the wet in Germany. Nonetheless Vettel remains optimistic that he has the car to challenge and would do so in the second half of the year.“This year the pendulum seems to swing once this side, once that side,” said the German. “Obviously if it’s like this, consistency is the key. Scoring points. I didn’t do myself a favour in Germany but I think it’s part of racing. Compared to last year, we lost the championship because our car wasn’t quick enough to be a match in the final part of the season, despite what happened with the DNFs. This year has shown so far that our car is more efficient, our car is stronger and still has a lot of potential to unleash – I’m quite confident with what’s in the pipeline that we can improve. Should be an exciting second part of the year.”Hamilton, however, has a formidable recent record in the second half of the season. In 2014 he retired at Spa after being hit by Nico Rosberg but went on to win five races in a row between Monza and Austin on the way to the title. In his other two championship-winning years with Mercedes, 2015 and 2017, he took five wins from six races immediately after Hungary and was hopeful of similar this year.“The second half is always exciting, it’s always intense,” he said. “The second half usually gets a bit better on our side so we will go and prepare and make sure we come back even stronger.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7dd7eb5424bc2a026a65b9bdfd6fa92f702e7/0_157_3794_2278/master/3794.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a124316e532fb13f5f98bf298440e90","title":"melissa reid demons golf british open","story":"Melissa Reid has plenty to say. That shouldn’t be interpreted as a criticism it was apparent again during the Open Championship as the 30-year-old proved an excellent addition to BBC Radio 5 Live’s commentary team in Carnoustie. She has ambitions in that domain. “I have always loved broadcasting,” Reid explains. “I would love to have a show where I would talk to athletes who have gone through adversity.” More of that later.Earlier, a marquee player the Ladies European Tour should be taking counsel from and promoting to the highest degree ruffled feathers within the organisation with a blunt analysis regarding the scenarios facing emerging players. One glance at the LET’s money list or fractured schedule backs up Reid’s claim that her professional-playing friends have had to get part-time jobs to get by. Two months on, Reid believes LET executives are “not interested in what I have to say”. Heading into this weekend’s Scottish Open, 10th on the money list has earned less than £26,000 for the year.Reid, a six-times LET winner and three-times Solheim Cup player, says: “It’s not really a schedule, is it? I got into a bit of trouble for talking about it, I got called in. It is my opinion, I have mates who have been out on tour for 10 years and had to get part-time jobs. People don’t understand that and don’t understand the struggle for girls, just getting a tour card and with no events to play. The tour is still giving out 30 cards a year which to me is daylight robbery because they have no events to play in.“I just stated facts, which are people are having to get jobs and there won’t be a tour soon. Those are facts. They have assured me there will be events next year so we will have to see. I’d love to eat my words.In response to complaint – and Reid is hardly alone – the LET has consistently pointed towards economic challenges. “I think it’s an explanation but I also think it’s to do with how the product is being sold,” Reid insists. “It is a fantastic product and it’s not getting marketed in the right way, in my opinion. I understand it is hard to get events but I feel like there have been bridges burnt.”Reid has similar, if less deep-rooted, scepticism regarding the youthfulness of players on the LPGA Tour in the United States. Teenage prodigies, she believes, come with drawbacks. “It’s incredible that Lydia Ko was winning events at 15 I’m not taking anything away from her and it’s an incredible achievement but at 15 I was still climbing trees,” Reid says. “I had a job at 18. For these girls it’s just golf, golf, golf.”If the Englishwoman’s forthright approach is highly admirable, it barely resonates in comparison to the fact she still plays professional golf at all. Six years have now passed since, when travelling to watch their daughter play in an event in Germany, Joy and Brian Reid were involved in a car crash. The golfer’s mother did not survive.“It is obviously a devastating thing to happen to anybody,” says Reid. “I don’t think it matters what age you are when you lose your mum, it will always be a big thing. The way I lost her was like a triple whammy. It definitely cut off a bit of my career and the stuff I went through, I doubt a lot of players would have come back from. The demons I had, I just struggled. People think I went off the rails, I didn’t really I just couldn’t be bothered to play golf.“It will affect me for my whole life. It has changed me as a person. Us golfers are a bit egotistical whereas this has made me the person my mum always knew I was. I don’t have to prove anything any more, I am really proud of who I am. I wish my mum had seen this but she knew it was there, I just had to grow up a little bit.“I really hope that I win a British Open or something big to prove to people and myself that, no matter the adversity, you can get over it as long as you surround yourself with the right people.”Reid’s latest British Open opportunity begins on Thursday, at Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes. The last time the event was there, in 2009, Reid was in the process of extricating herself from a high-profile mentoring project involving Sir Clive Woodward and 13 advisers. Kinetics experts and biomechanics specialists ultimately proved too much for Reid’s liking.“Do I completely agree with the concept, looking back? Probably not,” says Reid. “It was a little bit too much but I understand what he was trying to do.”Lytham again arrives at a time of change. Reid has switched caddie and coach within the last few weeks, with a straightforward ambition in mind. “I don’t feel like I have fulfilled my potential at all,” she says. “This is the first time I have felt consistent in work ethic, in who I hang out with. I feel like the best part of my career hasn’t happened yet.” Reid is firmly of a mind to walk the walk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f27c50350aeff317368657a549f85b245927ebd/0_64_6457_3875/master/6457.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103310659834be88c65866d62fe9206d","title":"tom daley if i hadnt met lance i dont know if id be diving now","story":"From being objectified at 14 to coming out five years later, the er has lived his life in public. Still only 24, he talks about his marriage to Lance Black, fatherhood – and why he’s speaking out about gay rights around he worldYou could say this about any famous athlete, but Tom Daley more than most: you’re so used to seeing him in some outlandish endeavour – superhuman, ethereal, from such a young age, on such a vast stage, a Peter Pan without the wires – that it is incredibly confusing to see him sitting, like a regular person, in a regular London office (his publisher’s), in regular clothes, talking about mindfulness. He is about to publish Tom’s Daily Goals, subtitled “Never feel hungry or tired again”, which is a bit rum from this beacon of good living, yet of course, hard physical graft for many hours of most days means that he probably knows better than most what hunger and tiredness mean.“I’ve toned this book towards imagining what my mum would be able to do, and what people would have time to do,” he says. Besides, he says, it’s not like the old days, when he could eat anything and do anything: most mornings, he wakes up and something hurts. He is still recovering from a shin injury, which itself is related to a hip problem, which itself is about a “lack of thoracic mobility. As I’ve gotten older as a er, I have to really focus on doing everything I can to make my body younger.” He turned 24 in May, but, of course, elite athletes live time differently, do as much to themselves in a year as everyone else does in a decade yet even leaving aside the brute physical endeavour, he has lived a lot of life at 14, he was the youngest British competitor in the 2008 Olympics, dragging his sport with him on to the front pages. He still wears a ring of the Olympic rings that his parents got him, in lieu of what he really wanted. “They were, like: ‘We know you’re going to get a tattoo, but you know, we can’t let our 14-year-old get a tattoo. Imagine what your brothers would ask for.’” (He now has them tattooed on the inside of his upper right arm.)Three years later, his father died of a brain tumour. A year after that, he became the mascot of all the exuberance and optimism that unexpectedly exploded with the London Olympics. “By 2013, I was thinking: ‘What am I doing? What now?’ All I’d focused on was London 2012, all I’d been thinking was: ‘I’ve got to try and medal.’ But then what? I was just down in the dumps. I went through a phase of just enjoying myself, eating what I wanted, going out with my friends, being an 18-year-old. I didn’t even know if I wanted to e any more. If I hadn’t met Lance, I don’t know if I’d be ing now.”When he released his YouTube video, which was touchingly done, a declaration of love more than anything else, he had been in a whirlwind romance with the US screenwriter Lance Black for just over six months. “It was a real love-at-first-sight thing. But then I had to come back to England so we were just talking on the phone or WhatsApp or whatever. Then he came over eight weeks later. The first night, I took him to meet my friends and said: ‘This is my boyfriend.’ The next night we went on our first date. The next night he asked me to be his boyfriend. The night after that, after a couple of lychee martinis, he told me he loved me. He extended his trip, we were already talking about babies and weddings. So that was in the first week. It was weird. But now it’s five years later …”The couple’s baby, Robert Ray Black-Daley, was born to a surrogate mother in July: probably the most remarkable respect in which Daley matured before his years was his desire to be a father. “I’ve been shopping for baby clothes for six years, since before I met Lance, since I was 17 or 18. There’s nothing I’ve ever been more sure of in my life than having a family. One of the things I was so mortified about, so upset about, when I came out, was that I’d never be able to have a family. But then obviously I did more research. Because there’s something so special about passing on what my parents have taught me to children of my own.”The couple live in central London: “I think Lance would feel even more homesick if it wasn’t the current political situation out in the States. Right now, he’s happy to not raise a child in that environment.” And he’s worrying about schools, because “in Plymouth, I know every school, I’d know exactly where I wanted him to go. In London, there are thousands, I don’t even know if I should be getting his name down.” I am able to share the peerless wisdom, here, that if he wants Robert Ray to go to a state school, he can just turn up when he’s five. “Yeah, I don’t know if I’d want to pay £50,000 a term. I went to a comprehensive till I was 10.” (At that point, he went to Plymouth College, a school so sporty that he was one of five pupils or ex-pupils in the London Olympics: if it had been a country, it would have come 23rd in the medals table.)Lance’s full name (Daley talks about him so much you get to feel as though you’re on first-name terms) is Dustin Lance Black he won an Oscar in 2009 for best original screenplay with Milk, making them the only married couple, as far as I can tell, who have an Oscar and an Olympic medal in their house. High-achievers live quite peaceably together, apparently: “Being in such different fields, there’s that constant level of curiosity but we also have so much understanding of how much work goes in to being at the top of your career. One of us will say: ‘I have to work tonight.’ ‘Fine.’ ‘I need to go to bed early tonight.’ ‘Fine.’ ‘I need to make sure that I get up at this time and have breakfast.’ ‘Fine, so long as you make me some breakfast.’”Black has also had a fascinating life, growing up a Mormon and then escaping with his mother, who remained “super-conservative”. Both men have achieved their full potential against hurdles of grief, pressure, prejudice, attention and acclaim, a living example of what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Daley’s book credits “making good decisions” – sleeping well, breathing, avocados on toast, being vegan for a day once a week, focusing on mobility, getting your blood moving, gyrotonics (this is a mixture of yoga and pilates, though that won’t help people who don’t know the difference).It’s not a very easy sell, fitness advice from a er it’s such a precise skill, such an unattainable physique. “You have to be the right shape, you can’t be 7ft tall. You’d just spin really slowly. The smaller you are, the faster you spin. Believe it or not, I’m one of the taller ers in the world.” (He is 5ft 10in.) Divers have a quality of mathematicians, so erudite and accomplished that if you’re any age over eight, you are too late to even begin to understand what they do and how they do it. Daley describes es that take a year to learn, that take on the quality of a quest: “One of the es that I’ve learnt was a forward three and a half somersaults with one twist. My coach saw someone on YouTube doing it on a Russian swing, part of a circus act. And we had to take it from a circus to an Olympic context. It’s not quite physically possible yet to do some extra somersaults in some es. But in the past 10 years ing has progressed faster than ever, just due to tech, facilities and learning more about the physics of it, basically.”He is able to draw universal tips for a life well-lived out of such a specific discipline because he has a deep-rooted, almost mystical respect for the idiosyncratic: it doesn’t matter if you’re doing it right, so long as you’re doing it. It comes out when he talks about his father, which he does a lot: a man who didn’t care what people thought but also sought to delight them, who had a comedy car horn and dressed up as Santa. “He would just be silly and joke around and not care. And that’s what I think: if you want to wear an orange and green tie-dyed shirt, go for it. If that’s what you like, you do you.”Tom’s Daily Goals is published by HarperCollins on 23 August (£16.99).

For most of the 80s we spent the days folded into cagoules as England performed the cricket equivalent of hara–kiri. The weather improved in the 90s but the results not so much.Fast forward to late June 2000. West Indies had won the first Test by an innings, Brian Lara had returned and the usual blueprint for a series seemed set.At the end of the first day England were delighted to have West Indies 267 for nine and all seemed well when Courtney Walsh was dismissed with the first ball of Friday morning. By tea England had been Ambrose-and-Walshed and West Indies had a first-innings lead of 133. But then Andy Caddick, touched by his intermittent genius, took five for 16 and West Indies were all out for 54. England’s target was 188.The next day 11 of us joined the queue. My middle brother was about to marry and there was something surreal, almost dreamlike in the just-maybe anticipation.Curtly Ambrose and Walsh were not going to make it easy and in the warhorses ran, ball after ball, faster and faster, as England stumbled, revived, stumbled, revived. Mark Ramprakash, opening, was bowled for two but Michaels Atherton and Vaughan put on 92, each scrambled single greeted with a guttural roar. When both fell and England found themselves 160 for eight, all seemed lost.But with not a hospitality bottom out of position, enter Dominic Cork who with a six, four fours and desperate singles took England to a barely believable victory. Walsh finished with six for 74, Ambrose with figures of 22-11-22-1.As the sun emerged we spilled punch-drunk on to the Lord’s turf England went on to lift the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 1969.Your favourite might be the first, or the most thrilling, the one with the tightest finish. Or it could be the one with the finest innings, in which your best-loved player scored all the vital runs or took the crucial wickets and catches. They are all good reasons to love a match. Only, it seems to me now that it is not what you are watching that matters so much as who you are watching it with. Oh, you can try and tell everyone else what it was like, to put across how exciting it all was. But the memories are so much better when you can share them with somebody you don’t have to describe them to, because they were there with you. Like Joe.It was Joe who called me up early in 2005 to say they’d put tickets for the last day of the Ashes on advance sale and to ask did I think we should get a couple. I told him not to bother, that the match probably wouldn’t make the fifth day, never mind the series. Thank God he bought them anyway. I remember our excitement when they stopped play early on the fourth day and we knew, for sure, we’d be there for the end of the series. Those tickets were going for over £1,000 each now. And we were both so skint that we probably should have sold them on, but we couldn’t bring ourselves to do it. We’d been waiting for England to win the Ashes over half our lives.I can’t even recall all that much of it now, just the little bits and pieces that survived the hangover from a party that started at 10am on Monday morning and lasted till we stumbled away from the victory parade in Trafalgar Square sometime the next afternoon. Kevin Pietersen’s century, yes, and the moment Shane Warne dropped that catch, and Ashley Giles’ 59, still the very best underdog innings I’ve seen in my lifetime. I don’t see Joe so much any more, since we settled in different parts. It doesn’t matter. When we meet, we talk about 2005, and I am endlessly grateful I have a friend who knew enough to know better than me.The Test began on Thursday, and Sunday was a rest day, as always. No rest for some: it was also speech day at boarding school, interminable as ever. But I did not then go home. I went to Manchester to stay with my friend Anselm, just as cricket-dotty as me. England’s 408th Test, my first ever. In some eyes, the worst ever.On an absurdly bland pitch, Australia had spent almost three days getting 656 for eight. By Monday, after we had escaped and reached the ground, England had no chance of winning and Australia had secured the Ashes yet again.But then Ted Dexter stayed most of the day and Ken Barrington stayed forever. In my mind’s eye I can still see the imperious arc of Dexter’s bat as the ball sped to the boundary. I have no such memory of Barrington, who batted more than 11 hours for his 256. Objectively he was not much fun. But we were giving the Aussies what-for in return and that was good enough for me.My memory also tells me it was hot and sunny. More reliable sources say mild and breezy. They also say that by the Tuesday, when England had also passed 600, matching Australia block-for-block, the crowd had dwindled and most of the kids on the ground were round the back playing their own livelier matches. Were we? What is certain is that following that strange debut I was somehow inspired to become a cricket correspondent. So Old Trafford ’64 must have had something.It had the reverse effect on Anselm. When we got back to school in September, he joined the Boat Club. He still lives in Manchester and says he HAS been back to Old Trafford to watch cricket - twice in 54 years. A Test match? Never again.England won by 18 runsThe virtues of the obvious are unfashionable nowadays. One only has to see how the England and Wales Cricket Board believes that the Hundred is so preferable to T20 cricket and that two conflicting short-form competitions in the summer of 2020 are somehow better than one good one. So I shall go for the obvious.The best series I have ever witnessed and am ever likely to witness is the 2005 Ashes the most extraordinary game remains the Headingley Test of 1981. The climax took place while I was engaged in a humdrum Championship match at Taunton against Derbyshire - except for the fact that Viv Richards was hitting a century to complete his set against all the counties. Even so I was glued to the TV in the dressing room as my Somerset teammate Ian Botham celebrated his triumphant return to the ranks in the England team and a possessed Bob Willis snubbed a startled Peter West in the post-match interview.The images remain: of a drab three days of Test cricket at gloomy Leeds in which England were being all too easily humbled. The barbecue on the eve of the rest day at the Botham residence was as near to a wake as is possible for that event. Willis contemplated being dropped and the imminent end of his international career Mike Brearley pondered the wisdom of returning to Test cricket – and why he had left out John Emburey? Then on the Monday when England followed on there is the unshackled Botham guffawing in the middle alongside Graham Dilley Brearley on the balcony to applaud Botham’s century and animatedly urging him to keep going as the faint possibility of a miracle entered his head the ball going into and out of Richie Benaud’s “confectionery stall”. Just before lunch on Tuesday Kim Hughes rejects a single to protect Graham Yallop from Willis, who was, by now, in another world.I once asked Botham whether this was his favourite Test. Of course it wasn’t. This game defined him and tormented him. By his own hand he had delivered such potent evidence of why he should not be captain of England.England won by an inns and 78 runsGreat Test matches tend to be close ones. Indeed the first Test with New Zealand at Lord’s in 2015 – an undulating affair of attack and counterattack, parry and riposte, that had spectators queueing round the block on the fifth day to be rewarded with a successful England victory charge – was arguably the most absorbing witnessed that summer cricket-wise.And yet it is the Ashes encounter at Trent Bridge a couple of months later, when Stuart Broad sliced through Australia with surgical precision and his colleagues delivered adhesive excellence in the slip cordon, in effect recapturing the urn in the first 94 minutes of the contest, that is burned into the old brain box forever.The scorecard – one that shows figures of eight for 15 by Broad, the tourists bowled out for 60 in the shortest first innings in Test history (18.3 overs), extras top scored with 14 and Joe Root ended the day with an unbeaten century - is an eye-catching record of the day, as are the frantic scribblings in this jotter’s notebook that seem to include more exclamation marks than runs managed by Australia.But it is as much about the imagery that the numbers and excessive punctuation throw up, such as the visiting skipper, Michael Clarke, staring long and hard into the green surface before the toss like a condemned man. His side’s granite-handed shots thereafter. Broad’s wide-eyed tribute to Edvard Munch after some brilliance from Ben Stokes at fifth slip, or the man of the hour (and a half) walking off with the Dukes ball held aloft and still displaying some of its gold lustre.To pinch a phrase from Brian Clough, another miracle worker on the banks of the Trent, I wouldn’t say Broad’s that day is the best bowling performance I have seen in my 10 years of covering Test cricket to date. But it is definitely in the top one.England won by eight wicketsThere have been many better England teams than the Class of 94, as nobody in history has ever called them. But none in my cricket-watching lifetime have produced a performance as savage and memorable as that team did against South Africa at the Oval. On the Friday evening England were facing a 2-0 series defeat. Then the whole team went postal and for five astonishing sessions they brutalised an excellent South African side. It was cricket’s version of Falling Down.England played like Pakistan at their most brilliant, with a desperate, irresistible aggression not so much cornered tigers as cornered lions. The mood was established by some beery slogging from Darren Gough and Phil DeFreitas, who ked Allan Donald all round south London on that Friday evening. Devon Malcolm, stirred after being hit on the head by a Fanie de Villiers bouncer, then produced the most coruscating spell of fast bowling. He took nine for 57, the best figures by a truly fast bowler in Test history, and flattened South Africa for 175. Their batsmen looked as if they had seen the devil. It was only Devon but on that day it was hard to tell the difference.Malcolm was one of many England players who for one reason or another were feeling aggrieved. Two others, Graham Gooch and the captain Mike Atherton, then blasted a barely believable opening partnership of 56 in five overs and England cantered to an eight-wicket victory. From the moment Gough and DeFreitas came together, England scored their runs at 5.76 per over and took a wicket every 30 balls. That team never played together before or after. If I live to 150, I doubt if I will see a more devastatingly brilliant England performance – in any sport. Oh and it was the weekend after I got my A-level results, and I had my whole life ahead of me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872442ca8c512513a88f5c487eadcea2843beb78/0_111_3128_1878/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ccdb5921343f87486465806441964f0","title":"talking horses popular limini back in action at galway tonight","story":"Willie Mullins’s mare hasn’t been seen for more than a year but punters fancy her chances for Monday’s return to Flat racingChris Cook: Limini, who won the mares’ novice hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival a couple of years ago, returns to action at Galway on Monday evening after more than a year on the sidelines. She’s evidently a warm order for the 7.40pm race, having been cut to 7-4 for that 20-runner handicap.It’s not my idea of a great bet but you can see why it appeals to some. Limini fared well on the Flat in France before joining Willie Mullins and he’s been saying for months that he’s keen to run her on the Flat. He’s also said it is a constant battle to keep Limini right and perhaps that job becomes easier if she doesn’t have to jump anything.She gets to run today off a rating of 89, which is probably lenient, seeing that her hurdles rating has climbed past 150. Very broadly, you’d expect a 40lb gap between the two, though such calculations are by no means reliable in every case.Ruby Walsh also makes his return to action, on the 11-8 shot Easy Game in the opening novice hurdle at 5.20pm. Walsh broke a leg in November and made a six-day comeback in mid-March before reinjuring the leg during the Festival.Good luck to him and also to punters betting on Galway this week. Goodwood, which starts tomorrow, will be quite tricky enough for me.Newmarket maidens frequently prove to be a fine source of future winners, particularly those maidens run at the July meeting. As usual, the standard appeared strong there earlier this month.It can pay to look back at recordings of these races to find runners making good late progress and one such candidate is No Way Jose (1.20), who is out again at Lingfield today.This No Nay Never filly was having her second career start last month in what was a strong renewal of a 6f fillies maiden that resulted in runners from the Charlie Appleby, John Gosden and Roger Varian stables filling the first three places with promising sorts.For a while, it was “No Way Jim” as Crowley had to sit and suffer on the Brian Meehan-trained filly from over a furlong out with limited room to manoeuvre and take advantage of a winning opportunity. The jockey was forced to accept a large slice of misfortune. Meehan’s horses often improve for a run or two, so No Way Jose can be even more streetwise this time around. With only five rivals, a repeat of any traffic problems is less likely. She’s available at 11-10."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269ba1f2b6e82633b8ba6ad916b18533ce1fd04d/422_138_3221_1933/master/3221.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9000fa77fd1f616b077605c939ee18e","title":"love island bluffers guide everything you need to know before the 2018 final","story":"What do you mean you haven’t been watching?

Because tonight is Love Island’s live final, where, after almost eight weeks of crying, dumping, fighting and very loud sloppy kissing, we find out which couple has won.Look: maybe you’re not one of the 3.4 million people watching Love Island. Maybe you decided to spend the summer watching the World Cup, instead, or didn’t want to dedicate 48 hours of viewing time to the show. Maybe you even went outside and lived your life – we’re not judging, but you definitely made a huge mistake. Don’t panic! It’s still possible to blag it. Here’s everything you need to know ...In theory, contestants couple up with someone they don’t mind sharing a bed with for the whole summer, and stay with that person despite loads of hot single people arriving every week to try to tempt them away. In practice, they just choose whoever they fancy on the day of the recoupling and hope for the best. Tonight, the public vote for the couple they like best, and the prize is £50,000, plus the unofficial prize of low-level fame for the next year.There are four couples in the final: Kaz and Josh, a supernaturally beautiful makeup artist paired with a lad who can’t believe his luck Wes and Megan, a 20-year-old nuclear engineer (really) coupled with a ‘shy’ model who “gets her tits out for a living” (her words) Laura and Paul and Jack and Dani.If Jack – a pen salesman from Essex with shockingly white teeth and a passion for birdwatching – and Dani – a sweet, innocent angel and daughter of EastEnders legend Danny Dyer – do not win Love Island, something has gone seriously wrong. The nation’s sweethearts got together on day one and have endured trials such as Jack’s ex Ellie entering the villa (they had a polite conversation and then proceeded to ignore each other) and the revelation that Jack has cheated on all of his previous girlfriends, which sent Dani into a panic spiral that he’d do the same to her. Ofcom received 2,600 complaints when the show made Dani cry. When they were separated for three days, Jack was so upset he couldn’t eat. Her dad appeared via Skype to give Jack his blessing (“a proper geezer, bang on”). If they are not crowned the winners, expect millions of people to take to the streets, overthrow the government and burn Buckingham Palace to the ground.Supporting Jack and Dani is a real basic move. Instead, say that you’re backing Laura, the ‘older’ – she’s 29, which is about 76 in Love Island years – contestant. Laura’s very relatable: a seething mass of insecurities permanently teetering on the edge of losing it, almost pathologically paranoid she’s about to get mugged off at any second, having been dumped by walking erection Wes AND personality void New Jack in favour of younger, hotter, blonder girls. She’s now paired up with Paul, a model who blew his one good anecdote (he snogged Britney Spears in a music video) too early on and is now scared to ditch Laura because there’s every chance she’ll go fully Fatal Attraction and murder him with her personalised water bottle.There was a point early on where it looked like Alex George, an actual doctor with a brain but the world’s most awkward bedside manner, would be a favourite. No one wanted to couple up with unlucky-in-love Alex, and dumb blonde cliche Hayley even swerved snogging him during a kissing game. This was significant as the contestants treat the rules of the games as laws and abide by them at all times, even if it involves getting off with someone you really don’t want to touch.But after weeks of lusting after women who don’t fancy him (new Laura, new Ellie) and treating the ones who do (Charlie, Grace, Alexandra) like dirt, public opinion has turned on ‘nice guy’ Dr Alex. Now no more than a sunburnt incel (mysteriously, he does not tan, just stays a violent shade of pink), he shoved Alexandra’s hand down his shorts in bed one night then accused her of “moving too fast” when she talked about meeting his friends after they left the villa. A man who thinks the phrase “I love cars” is an acceptable thing to say past the age of 10, Dr Alex has mistaken Love Island for having-a-bit-of-banter-with-your-mates Island and he somehow avoided being dumped from the island for weeks and weeks and weeks … until last night. Alexandra nailed it when she told him: “You’ve wasted my time, you’ve wasted your time, shame on you.”He will, of course, become a huge star and be seen giving out health advice on This Morning within a week.Actually, there’s been hardly any sex this year, apart from Wes and Megan’s determination to keep everyone awake at night in the communal bedroom. Instead, they’ve invented the Do Bits Society, which is for couples who haven’t had full sex, but have “done bits”. It’s basically a nice way of saying dirty stuff without spelling it out for their parents watching at home. Love Island: the Live Final airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2.

It was the impassioned plea of Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, as she summoned all the courage she had to reflect her feelings about her son’s death at the hands of George Zimmerman at a rally in New York. And it’s this remark that serves as the cornerstone for Rest in Power.After a lengthy bidding war, Jay-Z’s documentary series demarcates the comprehensive nature of race and justice in America. The small-screen doc demonstrates just the racialized roadblocks that inhibit Sybrina Fulton’s claim that “my son is your son” from becoming a unifying clarion call for justice. It’s an elaborate patchwork of interviews, vivid recordings, and critically important historical nodes, which help unearth the devastating details of Trayvon Martin’s death, the trial proceedings, and their impact on perceptions of criminal justice and the Black Lives Matter movement.Unlike the news cycle, the documentary takes numerous steps back to cover the more comprehensively the issues that informed the killing of Trayvon Martin – touching on everything from gun rights, political stakes, and the history of race in America. Like the director Jenner Hurst’s previous documentary work such as Brick City in 2009, the characters animate what would otherwise be a longer version of a prolonged item in the news cycle.The rawness of Trayvon’s father Tracy Martin’s pain strikes the viewer distinctly as he speaks about the moments after he found out that his son wasn’t missing, but that he was dead. But perhaps most raw and striking are the segments when Benjamin Crump, the family’s attorney, describes the vast array of tools at his disposal to place pressure on the city to release tapes and documents and eventually press for an arrest of Zimmerman. The media frenzy we faintly recall that informed the world about Trayvon Martin wasn’t rooted in happenstance but instead represents Crump’s mastery of the public narrative.The documentary appropriately avoids reenactments and es straight into unearthing clips, documents and in-person interviews. But it doesn’t preoccupy itself solely with interviews with lead attorneys, Trayvon’s family, or the arresting and investigating officers. Rather, the scope of inquiry expands the consideration of who is to blame not only for Trayvon’s death, but Zimmerman’s eventual exoneration. But in no way do the directors shy away from calling out the political elements that enabled Zimmerman to kill Trayvon under the guise of self-defense. Clips of then-Florida governor, Jeb Bush signing the “stand-your-ground” law with Marion Hammer, former Florida president of the National Rifle Association, serve as the political backdrop of the series. Stand-your-ground is what enabled Zimmerman to claim self-defense. Hammer’s inclusion in the documentary as well as the frequent and sometimes repetitive cuts to the same video of a speech by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre clearly demonstrate that Trayvon’s death was not just the culmination of fierce racial isions. It was also the consequence of careful, well-financed lobbying and sophisticated chicanery on the part of groups like the NRA. This is just a just one example of the great lengths the documentarians go to provide the viewer with the most complete picture.Rest in Power embarks on an ambitious enterprise: encapsulate the full range of systemic issues that inform the way we should perceive not just Trayvon’s death but the imbalanced relationship communities of color have with criminal justice institutions. And the series succeeds. It compels the viewer to contend with the micro- as well as macro-level impact of injustice along the dimensions of race. It treats carefully the impact of history on the present experiences of racial disparities, placing the victimized and marginalized at the center of the series’ narrative. And potentially, this piece could get the viewer closer to using Fulton’s words: “my son is your son.” In short, this docu-series should be required viewing for an education in race and criminal justice in America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a52bf9899c234ec34bc5dcf882a4f48cfd5ceb0/507_453_1029_617/master/1029.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bb6313adb9ea72e8a82a7a107d702b","title":"french skier lost 64 years ago in alps identified with help of social media","story":"Italian police Facebook post helps solve mystery of Henri Le Masne who disappeared near the Swiss-Italian borderA French skier who went missing more than 60 years ago has finally been identified after details of a probe into his disappearance were posted on social media, Italian police said Sunday.Human remains and ski equipment were found in 2005 more than 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) up the Cime Bianche in the Valtournenche valley of the Aosta region near the Swiss border in northern Italy.The man appeared to be well off given his top-line wooden skis, said Marinella Laporta of the forensic police unit in Turin.Investigators estimated the man to have been about 1.75 metres (five foot nine inches) tall and aged about 30, with his death likely occurring in the spring.They also found glasses, a watch and pieces of his shirt with embroidered initials.Having made no progress with identification, the Aosta valley prosecutor decided in late June to post the investigation’s findings on his Facebook page, asking readers to spread the information, especially in France and Switzerland.Frenchwoman Emma Nassem heard the story on the radio and said the missing man could be her uncle, Henri Le Masne, born in 1919, who went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn in 1954.Roger Le Masne, Henri’s younger brother and now 94, also came forward.“I am the brother of Henri Le Masne ... who is likely the skier who disappeared 64 years ago. He was a bachelor and quite independent. He worked in the finance ministry in Paris,” Roger said in an email made available by the police.Roger said he had gone to the hotel where his brother had taken a room for two weeks and where he found some personal effects, including money, after he went missing on 26 March, 1954.The police said a photograph provided by the family showed glasses matching those found by the investigators.A subsequent DNA test confirmed the identification, they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c73f90e115d9184d1279ac72722e094cfd131cb/0_196_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a42f65fd5e54b1c9b983b9002af7095e","title":"lombok earthquake more than 500 climbers trapped on mountain in indonesia","story":"Key route to summit of Mount Rinjani cleared after landslides caused by Sunday’s quakeHundreds of people are making their way down Mount Rinjani after becoming trapped when  a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed 17 people struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok.Rescuers set off on Monday morning to help nearly 700 trekkers and climbers who became stranded at two points on the mountain, Indonesia’s disaster agency said, after landslides caused by the powerful earthquake blocked some trails off the peak.The national park authority said a key route to the summit of the 3,726-metre (12,224ft) mountain had been cleared, and a helicopter was dropping supplies to people on other routes who were still picking their way to safety. An estimated 689 people were still on Rinjani, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the national disaster mitigation agency. “Hundreds of trekkers in the crater in climbing areas couldn’t come down when they wanted to, because the paths were covered by debris from landslides and there were fears of subsequent landslides,” Sutopo told a news conference. Authorities expected 500 trekkers to arrive at the foot of the mountain by 5pm, said Agung Pramuja, a disaster mitigation official in Indonesia’s region of West Nusa Tenggara. He said a landslide triggered by the quake trapped a group of six people at the crater lake of Indonesia’s second-highest volcano. About 100 army, police and other rescuers were working to get people down, with helicopters scouring the area for others still trapped.Mount Rinjani is a popular destination for adventurous climbers. The strenuous trek to the summit takes at least two days.“I thought I was going to die,” said John Robyn Buenavista, a 23-year-old American, who was at the summit when the quake hit. “I was clinging to the ground. It felt like it lasted forever. I saw people fall off, but it’s a blur,” he told Reuters.Officials said 17 people died in Sunday’s earthquake, which was centred on the northern part of Lombok, but was also felt on the resort island of Bali to the west. More than 150 people were injured, many by collapsing buildings. The evacuation team, which set out at 7am, comprised 184 people, including military, police and medical personnel, volunteers and park staff. Park officials closed the climbing route on Sunday morning and the stranded trekkers were advised to stay in a safe place until the rescue team arrived.According to local reports an Indonesian climber from Makassar was killed by falling rocks during the landslide. Other climbers are believed to be in good health.Buenavista, the US tourist, said he was about to take some dawn photographs at the crater edge when the earthquake struck, and his immediate thought was that the volcano had erupted. “I started running to the trail,” he told Reuters by telephone from the Gili Islands, off Lombok’s northwest coast, where he headed after a seven-hour trek to the foot of the peak. “At one point, I saw people with half of their bodies stuck in the rocks and I just couldn’t move. I felt paralysed and stopped moving. The guides were screaming, ‘Don’t die, don’t die.’ One of the guides had to shake me and take me by the hand. He told me that I had to go, and that they would be okay.” The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Lombok on Monday morning to visit the victims and oversee the provision of aid, including cash to help residents rebuild their homes. Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which is located on the seismically active “Ring of Fire” on the rim of the Pacific Ocean.

No one has managed to interview all 12, and they have been largely kept out of the public eye.The controversy over their arrival has become an obstacle to warming ties between the two Koreas. Family reunions planned for next month between relatives ided since the 1950-53 Korean war could be scrapped if the women are not allowed to return to the North, Pyongyang’s state newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, has said.Heo said he had decided to spy for the South after former classmates were executed in a political purge, and when he asked to defect, his handlers ordered him to bring the women with him.The allegations further blackened the reputation of Seoul’s spy agency, which has interfered in politics, aided corruption and falsified espionage investigations. The defection occurred during the presidency of Park Geun-hye, who was ousted and jailed for graft, and took a hostile stance toward the North amid heightened tensions.While there are about 30,000 North Korean refugees living in the South, it is rare for large groups to defect together, especially staff working in state-run restaurants abroad, who are considered elites by North Korean standards and chosen partly because of their perceived loyalty.The 12 women and one man were part of what the US government estimates to be 93,000 people dispatched by North Korea to work abroad and earn much-need hard currency for the regime. Dozens of North Korean restaurants dot China’s east coast and often include singing and dancing performances, particularly popular among South Korean tourists.North Koreans also work in the Russian logging industry and Qatari building projects.South Korea’s unification ministry has consistently said intelligence officers said the women came voluntarily, but has admitted it has been unable to speak with them directly. After the announcement of the investigation by the human rights commission, the ministry reiterated its stance that the women were not forced or coerced into defecting, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32a58522ff058f911442290f4bc7dcad87b6d1b7/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bd0421fae45e0821af9a2b41585a63c","title":"mh370 final report released by malaysian government live","story":"Four-year search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight was called off earlier this yearWe are closing this live blog now – here is our full report. Our south-east Asia correspondent Hannah Ellis-Petersen has this wrap of the key points of the MH370 report today.The long-awaited report – which was initially described as the “final report” though investigators then backtracked from that description – left the hopes of the families dashed after it failed to provide any concrete conclusions about the reasons the plane disappeared and any indicator where the wreckage might be.Speaking at a press conference, Dr Kok Soo Chon, investigator in charge of the MH370 safety investigation, did not assign blame for the incident but laid out several protocols that were broken by the air traffic control in Malaysia and Vietnam which ensured that the plane went missing for twenty minutes before anyone was alerted.Rather than providing answers, the 1,500 page report meticulously disproved many of the theories that have abounded about what happened to MH370. One of the few concrete conclusions drawn in the report was that the manoeuvre to turn the plane around, taking it off its normal flight path just after 1am, was initiated manually, either by the pilot or a third party, rather than because of autopilot, though it did not speculate reasons.“The turn back could not be attributed to an anomalous system,” said Kok. “It has been established that the air turn back was done under manual control, not autopilot...we cannot rule out unlawful interference by a third party.”Kok added that while some evidence that “points irresistibly to unlawful interference, such as the communications ceasing and the manual turn back” he also emphasised that no terrorist group had taken credit.Grace Nathan, the daughter of one of the passengers onboard MH370, who has been outspoken throughout the search for the plane, has written of her frustration at the substance of today’s report.“Ladies and gentlemen after 4.5 years of investigation the conclusion ... is : 1. We don’t know what happened. 2. We don’t know why it happened. 3. We don’t know how it happened. 4. We don’t know what if anything is going to be done about it,” Nathan wrote on Facebook. “Four years on, we are none the wiser,” she wrote.Some Chinese families of relatives who were on MH370 – and most of the 239 people on board the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing were from China – said they were waiting for a briefing on the report on 3 August in Beijing. Wen Wancheng, whose son was on the plane, said he would travel to Beijing, from Shandong province, south of the capital, for the meeting, but he isn’t hopeful.“It’s nothing more than a formality. I don’t think we are able to learn any more details, or what exactly happened. What I want is to find and punish all the people who are responsible for MH370,” Wen said.Jiang Hui, whose mother was on MH370, said, “What I care about is how the International Civil Aviation Organisation and authorities will analyse this report to adjust and improve their work to find out what happened to MH370. This report is just the start for me, not an end,” he said.The release of the investigation on Monday was widely followed in Chinese media. On the micrblog, Weibo, it was the sixth most viewed topic, with more than 2 million views. “I just want to know the truth,” one user wrote.Among the safety recommendations offered by the investigation team are reviewing the duty roster system with the objective of improving working conditions, refresher training for air traffic controllers, to introduce new security measures for cargo-scanning, and to ensure medical conditions of flight crew are reported to relevant bodies.My colleague Naaman Zhou has been following the story of MH370 throughout the search for the missing plane, he has this analysis of today’s report:Very little in today’s report is new. However, there are a few small revelations that will be interesting to the family members and next of kin. The first is that MH370’s emergency locator transmitters (ELT) all malfunctioned. ELTs are supposed to transmit distress signals that could have helped locate the plane, but all four of MH370’s ELTs failed. Their batteries were within their expiry dates, but for whatever reason, no signal was sent out. The report found that “there have been reported difficulties with ELT signals if an aircraft enters the water ... In these instances, the ELT does not activate, or the transmission is ineffective as a result of being submerged.” The second is about mangosteens and batteries. MH370 was carrying 4,566 kg of mangosteens and 221 kg of lithium-ion batteries in its cargo hold. It has long been speculated that this could have sparked a fire that led to the crash.The report today rejects this theory – but the analysis is based only by looking at previous battery and mangosteen shipments. The fine details confirm that the battery shipment did not go through x-ray screening on the day of the flight because “there were no available x-ray machines large enough”. Larger machines were installed a few months after MH370 disappeared. This could raise questions about whether a battery malfunction, or improper packing, could have led to the crash. The event is wrapping up, the moderator says 29 questions were asked and answered. He is thanking the media for their participation.It looks like questions are wrapping up. The moderator is urging journalists to ask more questions.“We don’t know when we will meet again,” he said.Someone is asking Kok Soo Chon why it has taken so long to release this report. Kok is laughing after this question, which seems understandable given he has addressed this point several times so far.However, he is answering: “This is a very difficult question so far, it is maybe the most difficult.”He says that one year after the plane went missing his team published a 600-page report. After that they began a process of checking and verifying. “After that we are able to come up with findings and analysis and conclusion.”He said there were many reasons for the delayed publication. As new information came in they had to change the report, “It’s a dynamic document,” he says. He added: “We cannot release our document, no matter how ready we are, when the search is still going on.”Kok said “sweat, tears and also joy” had gone into the report. “It won’t be satisfactory to everybody,” says Kok, but he takes comfort from the fact that seven countries had endorsed the report.Kok Soo Chon is mentioning the two passengers onboard MH370 who were found not to be travelling on false passports. Kok says “they were proved to be innocent”.Grace Nathan, the daughter of one of the passengers onboard the missing plane, has said the report “did not reveal anything new or earth-shattering”. She wrote of the Annex 13 Safety Investigation Team, who briefed the next of kin: “their role and scope came across very limited. The team was formed two months after MH370 disappeared. Therefore certain investigations had already been carried out by Malaysian police and or other bodiesauthorities before the team came into being. “They appear not have to questioned or challenged what was handed over to them. Nor was any new independent investigation launched....All in all the report did not reveal anything new or earth shattering. No conclusions were drawn, no blame was assigned.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s first trans pride parade takes place in dublin","story":"  July 28, 2018Participants call for improved healthcare and criticise Dublin Pride as \u0026lsquomarketing tool\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dragons\u0026rsquo Den star says he anticipates support from people involved in rural pursuitsGarda\u0026iacute investigating incident that destroyed 125m of wooden path on Thursday nightBrian O\u0026rsquoCallaghan-Westropp among 91 people who died in wildfires near AthensScandal called the \u0026lsquolargest health issue in decades\u0026rsquo by Labour spokesmanSteven Agnew praised for his \u0026lsquodedication and skill\u0026rsquo by Eamon RyanAn Bord Plean\u0026aacutela overturns council\u0026rsquos approval for 228-house north Dublin estatePatrick Menton ready to go home since February, but cannot until hours securedSpan would realise celebrated architect Edwin Lutyens\u0026rsquo original vision for the gardensSignificant progress made on water levels, obstacles and \u0026lsquopinch points\u0026rsquo, says MinisterJournalism undergraduates at NUI Galway lodge complaints about placementsDiscussions will include the forthcoming budget and the future of the CoalitionCourts\u0026rsquo only public restaurant, running for more than 40 years, expected to become officesCase studies: Working conditions and training opportunities draw young graduates abroadA number of initiatives and projects by a range of agencies are lined-up for 2018Four career experts offer advice on what to consider when deciding on your courseCouncil declines to outline steps it has taken to tackle the aggressive and invasive weedGrassroots developments can have stronger impact that criminal legislation, says MinisterCall from OSCE reverses Government position that it did not observe polls in US and EUMore than a third of parents taking out loans to pay for uniforms and booksIrish Medical Organisation estimates there are 1,400 fewer consultants employed than are needed"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580261.1532895266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses and doctors await commission report on staff pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNursing representatives also argue that pay rises are required both to encourage new graduates to join the public health system and to incentivise those already in post to stay there. In the coming days the Public Service Pay Commission is expected to finalise the first element of its new report: an examination on whether the country’s health service is experiencing difficulties recruiting and retaining key medical and nursing staff. The commission’s findings may not be published for a few weeks but unions and representative bodies are set to use any conclusion that recruitment and retention problems exist to press for improved pay.In essence both nurses’ and doctors’ representatives argue that Ireland is competing largely in the English-speaking world for medical and nursing graduates and that the public health service in Ireland is losing out to other countries where remuneration packages are better. Last month the Government agreed a €200 million settlement with medical consultants over its failure to pay increases under a contract negotiated in 2008.However, this did not address the two-tier pay structure that opened up after the government of the day in autumn 2012 introduced a unilateral 30 per cent reduction in salary for all consultants appointed after that time. The pay cuts were partially reversed in late 2014, but medical organisations have argued that a significant gap remains . They contend that the situation has actually been exacerbated by the recent settlement in that those appointed prior to the 2012 cut may, on foot of the new deal, be receiving up to 57 per cent more in some cases. Nursing representatives also argue that pay rises are required both to encourage new graduates to join the public health system and to incentivise those already in post to stay there. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) has pointed to the failure of special Government drives to attract Irish nurses working abroad to return home.INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha told an Oireachtas committee in July that if low pay for nurses was not corrected, “we will be unable to recruit and retain the nurses required to care for our citizens inside and outside the hospital system. That is a simple matter of fact”. Minister for Health Simon Harris, speaking at the INMO conference in May, said the Government recognised that there was a recruitment and retention challenge in nursing and health sector, although he cautioned that Ministers would await the outcome of the Pay Commission’s deliberations.However, the narrative of increased pay being needed to tackle recruitment and retention problems has been challenged in recent weeks.Separately, the Department of Public Expenditure argued in a spending review this month that there had been no mass exodus of nurses from the Irish health system. It maintained that outflows of nurses and midwives from the Irish public health system were “modest in both an Irish labour market context, and compared internationally”. It also maintained international evidence suggested that nursing and midwifery remuneration in the Irish public health system was “high comparatively”.Nurses dismissed this review as wildly inaccurate. The release by the HSE of details of hospitals being affected by up 350 vacant consultant posts will undoubtedly be seized on by the medical organisations to press the Government to address the two-tier pay system. While the difficulties of smaller hospitals in attracting senior medical staff has been acknowledged for some time, the new HSE figures show that one of the country’s largest centres, Cork University Hospital has 33 vacant consultant posts. The figures show that outside of the southsouth west- which has 67 vacancies many of the other hospital groups across the country have about 40 vacant consultant positions. The HSE report shows that there are, across the country, more than 40 vacant posts for consultants in general medicine.There are about 30 vacant posts for consultant psychiatrists and 28 for ear, nose and throat surgeons.The figures also suggest there are 18 consultant posts in emergency medicine vacant and 19 in anaesthesia.

Photograph: ThinkstockThere are almost 350 vacant hospital consultant posts across the public health service, new HSE figures show. The largest hospital in the south of the country, Cork University Hospital, which has about 130 consultants, has 33 vacant positions, according to the figures. In the Galway University Hospitals – part of the overall Saolta group in the west – there are 18 consultant posts vacant. In the Dublin-Midlands Hospital Group – which includes St James’s and Tallaght hospitals – there are 43 vacant posts.There are also 43 vacant consultant posts at the Ireland-East Hospital Group, which includes the Mater and St Vincent’s hospitals in the capital.The HSE figures show that in the South-South West group, which includes hospitals in Waterford, Tralee, Bantry and Mallow as well as in Cork city, there are 67 vacant consultant positions overall. These include 33 at Cork University Hospital. There are an estimated 3,000 consultants working in the public health service. The figures, which were released by the HSE in response to a parliamentary question tabled by Sinn Féin health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly, come as the Public Service Pay Commission is expected to finalise a report in the coming days on recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service. Unions hope this report will lead to pay increases for their members. The HSE said it had put in place a new database system that matched consultants to particular posts in hospitals. It said that where a consultant was not matched to a position on the database it was an indicator that the position was vacant.The HSE said there were currently 349 unmatched consultant positions in hospitals and community settings.However, it maintained the database had only recently been put in place and that the data matching exercise was not completed. It warned there “may be variances and gaps in the data supplied to that held within hospitals”.Medical organisations have estimated that the number of vacant consultant positions could be even higher at up to 450.Ms O’Reilly said the figures reinforced the arguments made by hospitals and medical organisations that there was a recruitment and retention crisis.“The HSE has tried every way to get around the fact that there is a problem, including employing doctors not on the specialist register as consultants and employing locumagency consultants but this just papers over the true extent of the crisis,” she said. “There is a crisis and the Minister for Health and the HSE need to engage with representatives of hospital consultants and come up with a plan to address the situation, because continuing on this current trajectory is extremely dangerous for patients, staff and the health service.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3579935.1532895877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ban gambling advertising in sport suggests president higgins","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins  at Croke Park on Saturday. Speaking in the stadium on Sunday, the President said he was “very concerned about gambling” in sport. Photograph: Tommy DicksonInphoPresident Michael D Higgins has said he is troubled over the issue of gambling in sport – and that gambling platforms should not be allowed access to advertising in sports.Speaking at Croke Park at the All-Ireland hurling semi-final between Limerick and Cork, Mr Higgins said he was “very concerned about gambling” in sport.By convention, the president of Ireland does not intervene in policy matters such as gambling, so Mr Higgins’s intervention is likely to raise eyebrows – especially with a presidential election looming in the autumn.The President referenced a recent visit to a treatment centre in Co Mayo where he drew attention to the amount of advertising for gambling websites that is broadcast during TV sports programmes.“I visited the Hope House in Mayo recently who have been a great assistance to some people who have got over what is, hopefully, a terrible temporary problem.“I think in a way we should protect our sports of keeping them free from this kind of stuff,” he said.“We need to protect our sports more,” he said, repeating his concerns about the influence of gambling.He referred to the need for more education about the dangers of gambling, but added: “You can’t do everything through education.” “I just think it should be protected from it. There is no one being heavy about it. What you can do is through education, obviously, through the school systems.“As well as that, we do need, and it’s not for me as President as I’m no influence except to say what I think, is that the integrity of sport means having care for everyone who participates,” Mr Higgins said.“Having care for everyone who participates means not exposing them when in fact they are vulnerable. How you deal with vulnerabilities is by preparing them of course.“But you can’t do everything through education. For too long in Ireland we often ignore problems that are staring us in the face,” he said.A long-awaited Bill to regulate gambling, the Gambling Control Bill, is still being prepared by the Department of Justice – five years after the then government approved its general scheme.

Video: David Dunne\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSean Spicer in the Trump Hotel in  Washington:  set to embark on a month-long tour to promote his new book. Photograph: Mitchell LongIt has just turned noon on a weekday in Washington, and at the Trump International Hotel a black SUV glides into the side entrance. A ripple of anticipation passes through the small crowd as onlookers strain to see who is hiding behind the darkened windows, when out pops Sean Spicer.The boyish former White House press secretary is all smiles as he bounds up the steps to the hotel. Inside he is greeted like a prodigal son, shaking hands with the staff members and beaming as he walks through the lobby.We’re here to meet for lunch – at my suggestion. The Trump Hotel has become something of a mecca for Republican strategists and Trump officials since the election of the 45th president of the United States, bumping some of the city’s more established boltholes like the Willard Hotel down the list when it comes to go-to meeting spots and sparking outrage from ethics watchdogs.I ask him if he comes here often. “Not so much when I was in the administration – it was tricky – but much more now,” he says, as we make our way to the hotel restaurant, which overlooks a stunning atrium.Donald Trump has visited the restaurant several times since becoming president 18 months ago – one of the few times he has been spotted outside the White House or at official events since moving to Washington from Manhattan.We take our seats at a quiet table just next to the booth where the President, along with his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, had dinner with Nigel Farage a month after the election.Spicer takes a quick phonecall. It’s someone from the White House. They are trying to co-ordinate with Spicer’s assistant who is delivering copies of his book. “Just make sure Potus gets a copy before he gets on the plane,” he says, using the DC shorthand for the President of the United States. “And Flotus, I want her to have one too” he adds, referring to the First Lady. “Sorry about that,” as he turns to the task at hand.As we settle down with menus, Spicer recommends the bacon for starters – an elaborate process that involves the waiter searing raw bacon at the table. After that, it’s a healthy salad and still water for the former press secretary who is in full-on health mode as he embarks on a frenetic month-long tour to promote his new book.He’s just off the express train from New York, where he was taking part in TV interviews for the various network chatshows. Further readings and events around the eastern seaboard await.\u0026nbspSpicer may be hailed as a superstar in the Trump Hotel but elsewhere he remains a controversial figure. He was heckled at a book event in New York and has been lambasted by interviewers for his role in promulgating the notion of fake news.“It’s been a busy few months,” says Spicer, who explains the rationale behind writing the book. “It was a few months after I left the White House. I was giving speeches, interviews that I realised that in most cases people would say ‘I read a story that said you said this,’ or ‘I heard that you said that.’ I finally realised that I could either leave it up to all of these anonymous sources to talk about me, or I could tell my own story in my own words.”The result is The Briefing, a 250-page book released this week that recounts Spicer’s six months in the White House. Though the last year or so has witnessed a flurry of books on the Trump presidency – most notably Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury and James Comey’s A Higher Loyalty – this is the only memoir from someone who served in the Trump administration.Despite the huge churn of staff at the White House there have been no kiss-and-tells. Senior officials such as Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn and Hope Hicks have largely kept their counsel since serving and leaving the Trump administration.But Sean Spicer’s new book is unlikely to cause the President or his team too much concern – it is unfailingly positive about Donald Trump.One line from the book, which has been widely mocked, is his description of the President as “a unicorn, riding like a unicorn over a rainbow”. At other points Spicer is less fawning and more analytical about the President’s talents.“What made the Trump campaign so different was that eight times out of 10 they would break the rules and be proven right. We’d said you can’t do that, and they would do it anyways. And it would work,” he writes. It’s difficult to argue with.But the huge problems presented by Trump’s presidency – from his aggressive, anti-immigration stance to his incendiary language and attacks against the media – loom across the pages of the book, a constant elephant in the room.When we meet, it is just days after Trump’s widely-panned summit with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. What is his view on the President’s handling of the situation?Spicer pauses. “I’m glad they made it clear what his position was, in his statements in the days after, and his interviews.“Having been on the inside, I know that it’s easy to immediately cast judgment on things, without knowing some of the back and forth that happened behind the scenes. At the end of the day, the question is did you fix or make it clear what you were intending – I think it was made clear.”I ask if it is a turning-point for his supporters. “No. Like so many things that affect Trump, he has faced countless obstacles, but has come back. His critics have said this a hundred times before.” He points out that Newt Gingrich – a Trump ally who described the Russian meeting as the worst mistake of Trump’s presidency – is now “back on track” after the President’s claim that he does in fact believe US intelligence that Russia interfered in the election.Similarly, I ask him how he can stand over a president who has become the face of an immigration policy that separates children from their parents. Again, a short pause, before he effectively side steps the issue.“I think that part of being a Republican is standing for strong borders and strong national security. I think we need to do a better job of messaging that,” he says. “Are we doing immigration the right way, are we ensuring that people are coming in at the proper point of entry, are we ensuring that children are travelling with people who are their legal s or parents? There is a way that we can do this better, there’s no question about it,” he says, always the consummate PR professional.But if Spicer is consistently\u0026nbsployal to his former boss, he is more honest about himself and his own shortcomings as press secretary. “I became the story too often,” he says candidly, as he reflects on his time in the White House. Was he to blame for this, or was it an inevitable outcome of representing the most unconventional president in recent history when the daily White House press briefings became must-see viewing? “Some of it was timing, but some of it was me. There are a lot of things I would have loved to do over again.”Spicer’s infamous claim about the crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration are explored in the book, as are his tense first press briefing when he stormed out of the room without taking questions.“Yes, sometimes. Anyone who doesn’t acknowledge some degree of personal pain is lying. There were plenty of times I would have liked to do something again, but it’s not just how it works.”Spicer is full of praise for his successor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “The job is to represent the President. She does that, and has successfully managed not to be the story.”Nonetheless, Spicer shares many of his former boss’s views on the media. In his book he criticises the White House press corps “pack mentality”.“The inability of any journalist in the briefing room to call out the bad or misleading reporting or antics of another reporter for fear of retribution is a problem,” he writes. He also says the media is “obsessed with palace intrigue instead of issues of substance, prioritising the number of clicks, viewers, and subscriptions”.But what about the President’s relentless attacks on the free press?He backtracks slightly: “Look, I think we shouldn’t paint anything with a broad brush – be it the media, Republicans, conservatives, what have you. It’s a much more effective strategy to highlight particular instances of concern. You don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are good reporters, good stories – but what we want to do is to make sure that we call out bad stories, bad narratives.”On one issue though he is consistent – he still contends (as he has said before) that there has been too much focus by the media on the Russia investigation. This is difficult territory for the former press secretary. Like many current and former Trump officials, Spicer is widely believed to have been interviewed by the Robert Mueller team as part of the Russia investigation. He declines to discuss it.But on the wider issue of the Russian investigation he wants to set the record straight.“Do I think we should be doing every single thing we can to be ensuring integrity in our voting systems? Yes. Do I think we should be doing every single thing to stop Russia or any other entity from meddling in our voting? Yes. Should we condemn it? Yes. Let’s be 100 per cent crystal clear on that, and the more the White House can clarify that the better. The other issue with which I think the President is rightly frustrated is this focus on – two years later – a narrative about collusion with Russia.”Spicer’s lengthy description of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his central role in the Trump campaign in the book has also raised eyebrows. Manafort, who worked on Trump’s campaign for five months, is currently in jail awaiting trial. On this point, Spicer is unapologetic. He points out that Manafort is in jail for failure to register as a foreign agent for clients he\u0026nbsphad years ago – “nothing that happened in the campaign”. He says that Manafort was brought into the campaign to focus on delegates at the convention. “Manafort had worked for Ford, Dole, Reagan. He’s been involved in delegate counting and conventions going back to the 1970s. There is no question that for that task at that time he was the right man.”Some of the most interesting passages of The Briefing are those which deal with his time at the Republican National Committee (RNC). (Though it also reveals that in his younger years, he worked for democratic Senator George Mitchell, who would later become Northern Ireland envoy.) Spicer worked for the Republican party organisation for six years, both as communications director, and chief strategist, working closely with Reince Priebus, who was tapped by Trump to become chief of staff, before being replaced by John Kelly.He was at the heart of the organisation when Donald Trump emerged as an unlikely contender for the presidential nomination, and eventually as the Republican candidate, a relationship he charts in the book.Eighteen months after the election, how does Spicer assess relations between establishment Republicans and Donald Trump now? Trump has publicly sparred with congressional leaders like Mitch McConnell, while respected Republicans such as John McCain and Lindsey Graham have openly criticised the President. But in recent months, most Republicans in Congress have rowed in behind him. Has Trumpism become the new Republicanism?“To an extent, I think that the sitting president always defines the party. In the same way, there were conversations about the direction of the Democratic Party in 1992 under Bill Clinton, there was discussion of whether Obama was bringing the party further to the left, I think the president will always reflect the party which has the White House.”He continues: “Look, the rank and file of the Republican party support Trump. That is why the party is supporting him. They’re not just following him willy-nilly. They’re following him because of the support he has. He’s got the second-highest approval among Republicans in modern history, second after George W Bush following 911, so you can make the case that there are a lot of elites within Washington DC that are unsure, but if you look at the rank and file of the party, they’re with him.”As for his own future, he has set up a consultancy firm in DC and is a regular contributor to conservative channels such as Fox News. He lives in Alexandria Virginia, just outside Washington, with his wife Rebecca, a well-known public affairs professional in DC, and their two children.Significantly Spicer has joined America First, the political action committee established to forward the Trump-Pence agenda, prompting speculation that he could be heavily involved in Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Trump jnr and Jason Miller attended Sean Spicer’s lavish book launch party at the Trump Hotel earlier this week. If there is any residual split in the Republican party since the election of the firebrand Donald Trump, it is clear whose side Spicer is on.He says he believes that President Trump will run again in 2020. But will he win? “Right now, if the election was held, yes,” he says, pointing to his huge support among the Republican base outside DC.I ask him if he misses the job. “No,” he says emphatically. “I miss the people, I’m glad I did, I was honoured to do it, but it was unbelievably intense. This was after six years at the RNC which was also intense.”There is one job he hasn’t ruled out though. Rumours surfaced a year ago, that he could be in the running to become the US ambassador to Ireland. Two candidates who were under consideration for the job have dropped out, with the result that Ireland is one of only a handful of European countries without a US ambassador.Spicer is a proud Irish-American, who in the past has spoken fondly of his Irish heritage and of William Spicer, his great-grandfather, who he said emigrated from Kinsale. He told The  that the Corkman won a medal of honour “for extraordinary heroism” sweeping mines for the US navy in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, during the Spanish-American War in 1898.Still, Spicer is coy when asked if he would be interested in the post of US ambassador to Ireland. “Right now, my focus is on the book tour, and my work here, but the idea of public service, serving my country is something that appeals to me. I would never rule anything out.”He visited the US ambassador’s residence in Dublin\u0027s\u0026nbspPhoenix Park during a recent trip to Ireland, and is due to visit the city\u0026nbspagain this month. Among the anecdotes in the book, he describes how he loaned\u0026nbspPresident Trump a green tie for Enda Kenny’s visit. Whether “Ambassador” Sean Spicer is next on the agenda will ultimately be the decision for the President.As we finish lunch and make our way back to the lobby, people start pointing and taking photographs. “I’m used to it,” he says with his trademark smile. “I was checking out of my hotel in New York this morning, this guy said to me . . . ‘Do you know who you remind me of?’” It happens all the time.”With that, he waves goodbye and walks\u0026nbspout the hotel door, head held high, ready for the next adventure.The Briefing by Sean Spicer, is out now (Biteback Publishers)"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Western cyclists killed in suspected terrorist attack in TajikistanAfrica\u0026#39s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#39s economy reelingJapanese firm selling advertising space on commuters\u0026#39 armpits claims to have signed up first clientEnding life support: Judges will no longer have to rule in vegetative state cases when families and doctors agreeKangaroo runs amok in Australian home after smashing through windowHun Sen\u0026#39s ruling party in Cambodia claims all 125 election seats in sham poll dubbed \u0026#39death of democracy\u0026#39Fake texts and toothless public votes: ITV warned it could lose public\u0026#39s trust after Love Island \u0026#39bible\u0026#39 leakedWho Is America? episode 3 review: Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s uninspired satire misses the targetFugitive speedboat killer \u0026#39hiding on the Med\u0026#39 is warned \u0026#39justice is coming\u0026#39 by victim\u0026#39s fatherDawn Sturgess funeral: No pallbearers for Novichok victim as safety measures \u0026#39protect mourners\u0026#39 in SalisburyTrains cancelled on first morning of Northern Rail reintroducing services after timetable chaosJeremy Hunt describes his Chinese wife as Japanese in \u0026#39terrible\u0026#39 mistakeZimbabwe election: Voters cast their ballots in first poll since Mugabe coupFrench skier who vanished in 1954 in Italy identified after social media appeal The decent, beating heart of Love Island: how Dani Dyer saved the seriesChina offers to open discussions on post-Brexit trade deal, Jeremy Hunt says after talks in BeijingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Pope accepts resignation of archbishop Philip Wilson convicted of child abuse cover-upWestern cyclists killed in suspected terrorist attack in TajikistanAfrica\u0026#39s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#39s economy reelingJapanese firm selling advertising space on commuters\u0026#39 armpits claims to have signed up first clientEnding life support: Judges will no longer have to rule in vegetative state cases when families and doctors agreeKangaroo runs amok in Australian home after smashing through windowHun Sen\u0026#39s ruling party in Cambodia claims all 125 election seats in sham poll dubbed \u0026#39death of democracy\u0026#39Fake texts and toothless public votes: ITV warned it could lose public\u0026#39s trust after Love Island \u0026#39bible\u0026#39 leakedWho Is America?

Five hundred are in Segara Anakan area, and 60 are in Batu Ceper, said the head of Rinjani national park Sudiyono, who goes by one name.Those believed to be stranded include citizens from the United States, France, The Netherlands, Thailand and Germany, as well as many other countries, search and rescue officials said.Indonesian soldiers and rescue team gather to prepare for evacuating tourists from Mount RinjaniAt least 16 people were killed in the earthquake across affected areas of Lombok, while hundreds of buildings were destroyed.The rescue operation on Mount Rinjani is likely to run until at least Tuesday and a military helicopter has dropped supplies at several spots on the mountain, according to search and rescue agency officials.For supplies, they can still survive for another one to two days, Agus Hendra Sanjaya, spokesman for Mataram\u0027s search and rescue agency, said.No hikers are injured, he added.Indonesian and foreign climbers are seen after walking down from Rinjani Mountain at Sembalun village in LombokA magnitude 6.4 earthquake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.Rising some 3,726 metres (12,224 feet) above sea level, the peak is the second-tallest volcano in Indonesia and a favourite among sightseers keen to take in its expansive views.Hiking trails on the mountain were closed following the quake due to fear of further landslides.The epicentre of the earthquake was 50 km (30 miles) northeast of Lombok\u0027s main city Mataram, the United States Geological Survey said, far from the main tourist spots on the south and west of the island.The initial tremor was followed by two strong secondary quakes and more than 100 aftershocks.An Indonesian man examines the remains of houses, after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck, in LombokSome 160 people were injured as a result, said Mohammad Rum, head of West Nusa Tenggara disaster agency.Among the dead are one Malaysian, with six injured, the Malaysian foreign ministry said.President Joko Widodo visited the affected site on Monday and promised financial support for people who had lost their homes.We must be aware that our country is in the Ring of Fire, so people need to be prepared to face any disaster, Widodo said.Indonesia, one of the most disaster-prone nations on earth, straddles the so-called Pacific \u0027Ring of Fire\u0027, where tectonic plates collide and a large portion of the world\u0027s volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.In 2004 a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.3 undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra in western Indonesia killed 220,000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean, including 168,000 in Indonesia.Please review our commenting policyWestern cyclists killed in suspected terrorist attack in TajikistanAfrica\u0026#39s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#39s economy reelingJapanese firm selling advertising space on commuters\u0026#39 armpits claims to have signed up first clientEnding life support: Judges will no longer have to rule in vegetative state cases when families and doctors agreeKangaroo runs amok in Australian home after smashing through windowHun Sen\u0026#39s ruling party in Cambodia claims all 125 election seats in sham poll dubbed \u0026#39death of democracy\u0026#39Fake texts and toothless public votes: ITV warned it could lose public\u0026#39s trust after Love Island \u0026#39bible\u0026#39 leakedWho Is America?

The models displaying the adverts are pictured grasping overhead handles on trains or stretching to show off their armpits.The Seishin Biyo Clinic has been the quickest off the mark to secure this unconventional advertising space, using models’ armpits to raise awareness - appropriately - of its painless underarm hair removal procedure, the Togech news site reported.The company is looking to hire more armpit models, Wakino Ad states on its web page, including male models. It has also announced plans to stage a beauty contest to find the most attractive armpits in Japan.The company behind armpit advertising says it is looking to hire more armpit modelsArmpits are not the first part of the female body that Japanese advertisers have been encouraged to take advantage of, with Absolute Territory PR in 2013 launching a campaign to encourage advertisers to purchase space at the back of models’ legs, strategically between the hem of miniskirts and the top of long socks.More than 1,300 women applied to be advertising hoardings in the first three months after the company was set up.Wakino Ad’s campaign, however, is likely to go into hibernation as soon as the autumn months arrive and young women begin to cover up to keep warm.Please review our commenting policyWestern cyclists killed in suspected terrorist attack in TajikistanAfrica\u0026#39s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#39s economy reelingEnding life support: Judges will no longer have to rule in vegetative state cases when families and doctors agreeKangaroo runs amok in Australian home after smashing through windowHun Sen\u0026#39s ruling party in Cambodia claims all 125 election seats in sham poll dubbed \u0026#39death of democracy\u0026#39Fake texts and toothless public votes: ITV warned it could lose public\u0026#39s trust after Love Island \u0026#39bible\u0026#39 leakedWho Is America? episode 3 review: Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s uninspired satire misses the targetFugitive speedboat killer \u0026#39hiding on the Med\u0026#39 is warned \u0026#39justice is coming\u0026#39 by victim\u0026#39s fatherDawn Sturgess funeral: No pallbearers for Novichok victim as safety measures \u0026#39protect mourners\u0026#39 in SalisburyTrains cancelled on first morning of Northern Rail reintroducing services after timetable chaosJeremy Hunt describes his Chinese wife as Japanese in \u0026#39terrible\u0026#39 mistakeZimbabwe election: Voters cast their ballots in first poll since Mugabe coupFrench skier who vanished in 1954 in Italy identified after social media appeal The decent, beating heart of Love Island: how Dani Dyer saved the seriesChina offers to open discussions on post-Brexit trade deal, Jeremy Hunt says after talks in BeijingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1510  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg","title":"deutsche bank brexit staff move jobs frankfurt london city euro clearing","story":"Created with Sketch.London has been regarded as a leader in the clearing market but European rivals now encroachingClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit: Deutsche Bank moves half of euro clearing business from London to FrankfurtDeutsche Bank has moved almost half of its euro clearing business from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit. Euro clearing is the system through which euro-based financial transactions are settled, and London is known as a leader in the clearing business. Clearing house LCH, owned by the London Stock Exchange, previously dominated the market, processing almost £900bn in deals per day. However, since the Brexit vote, European rivals, including Deutsche Borse-owned Eurex, have been making moves to steal London’s crown. France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire said last year that Brexit could be an opportunity for Eurozone states to take control of clearing and a 2016 report by by consultancy firm EY suggested that a departure of euro clearing could cost 83,000 jobs in the City.Deutsche’s decision to relocate clearing activities has not had an impact on UK jobs. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said that the bank is effectively pushing a different button to route the clearing to Eurex.\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Eurex said that it now has a market share of 8 per cent of euro clearing, up from virtually zero a year ago.The group said in 2017 that it was committed to the UK, as it signed the lease on a new London headquarters, taking on space at new City site 21 Moorfields for 25 years.

Mr Cryan was replaced by Christian Sewing, who said Deutsche needed to focus on what it does best, with the result that the total number of staff at the group would fall from 97,000 to “well below” 90,000.Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/14/Camp-Bestival-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6434111  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/14/Camp-Bestival-3.jpg","title":"camp bestival weather cancel close lulworth castle shut latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Organisers said they were \u0027devastated\u0027 but added it had been the \u0027best three days in the festival\u0027s history\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureCamp Bestival cancelled: Music festival forced to close due to bad weather“Devastated” Camp Bestival organisers have shut down its main arenas due to poor weather conditions.\u0026nbspAfter weeks of high temperatures in the UK, thunderstorms, high winds and rain caused many tents to flood, while all stages have been shut down due to health and safety concerns.\u0026nbspThe festival, held at Lulworth Castle in Dorset,\u0026nbspwas supposed to close tonight (29 July) by the Scottish band Simple Minds, who posted a statement addressing the issue on their Twitter account and linked to the festival’s own official update.Organisers said they have been advised by the safety team that arenas cannot be re-opened.

The data shows the annual growth rates of consumer credit and mortgage lending were unchanged last month, at 8.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively. The Bank said mortgage lending “remains modest compared to the pre-crisis period”, but noted the number of mortgages approved ticked up in June to 66,000, close to the average since the end of 2013. Meanwhile, credit card lending rose by 9.5 per cent. The Bank said credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years, with the growth rate of credit card lending exceeding that of other loans and advances such as overdrafts and car finance. The credit data comes as markets prepare for the Bank of England to announce an increase in interest rates to 0.75 per cent this week, and follows a report from the Office for National Statistics last week which showed UK households collectively spent more than they earned in 2017, for the first time this in almost 30 years. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ”The further pick-up in households’ and corporates’ borrowing in June strengthens the case for the MPC to raise interest rates at its meeting on Thursday, though we doubt that the recovery has further to run. House purchase mortgage approvals, in particular, will struggle to rise further, having hit a five-month high in June.“The upturn in borrowing will run out of steam.”Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, said the latest figures should give pause to central bank policymakers pushing for a rate hike. \u0026nbsp“With consumer credit growth remaining high, the Bank of England should think carefully about the risks of raising interest rates on Thursday,” she said.“After a decade of stagnant wages, UK household debt is now worse than any time on record, with households having turned to borrowing in order to spend £25bn more than their income to make ends meet. Will government advice on saving and debt protect us?UK adults hiding £69.6bn of secret debt from partners, survey revealsLink between mental health issues and problem debt \u0027must be broken\u0027“Unaccompanied by a boost to incomes, a rise in borrowing costs would further burden indebted households and threaten the UK economy’s fragile recovery.”The Bank’s data showed the total amount borrowed by businesses in June rose by £2.6bn, more than half of which came from bank lending. Mr Tombs noted that the increase “largely reflects a surge in M\u0026ampA activity in May, rather than signs that firms are borrowing more to invest”. He added: “A lasting pick-up in corporate borrowing likely won’t emerge until firms can be sure that a no-deal or hard Brexit will be avoided, and that point probably won’t be reached until early next year.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1510  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg","title":"deutsche bank brexit staff move jobs frankfurt london city euro clearing","story":"Created with Sketch.London has been regarded as a leader in the clearing market but European rivals now encroachingClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit: Deutsche Bank moves half of euro clearing business from London to FrankfurtDeutsche Bank has moved almost half of its euro clearing business from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit.

Mr Cryan was replaced by Christian Sewing, who said Deutsche needed to focus on what it does best, with the result that the total number of staff at the group would fall from 97,000 to “well below” 90,000.Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/28/20/11-Gregory-Peck-Getty.jpg","title":"national curriculum 30th anniversary english novels school syllabus wuthering heights hamlet","story":"Created with Sketch.From An Inspector Calls to The Return of the Native, the set texts you longed to see burnClick to followThe Independent OnlineGregory Peck as Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee’s To Kill a MockingbirdThe National Curriculum was introduced 30 years ago this week.Part of the Education Reform Act 1988, which was given royal assent on 29 July 1988, the legislation sought to\u0026nbspstandardise teaching in schools across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.While the intention of ensuring students nationwide received instruction of even quality over the same modules was a noble one - making a pupil’s experience less of a lottery at the mercy of a particular teacher’s taste - critics of the curriculum argue that, in practice, repeating the same texts year after year can be a deadening business that does no one any favours.Just ask John Keats or the Metaphysical poets.With that in mind, here’s our round-up of the books most ill-used by English teachers and their classes alike.This American favourite from Harper Lee addressed themes of race and injustice still pertinent in US society today and unquestionably deserves it places in the classroom.Even students who do not pursue reading as a leisure activity after graduation remember Lee’s principled\u0026nbspAlabama attorney Atticus\u0026nbspFinch – seen through the eyes of his daughter Scout – as he comes to the aid of falsely accused black defendant Tom Robinson\u0026nbspin the courtroom.Memorably played on screen by Gregory Peck, the work is also earnest to a fault and, as propaganda for lawyers, deserves to be taken with more than just a pinch of salt.Lord of the Flies (1954)A novel with much to say about the innate barbarity of man, a subject with which its GCSE\u0026nbsplevel readership should already have firsthand experience, William Golding’s work is bleak indeed and something of a slog.But the tale of Ralph, Jack, Piggy and their classmates forming their own tribe on a desert island before\u0026nbsptearing themselves apart in a fury of self-destructive occult violence might be repurposed as a Brexit allegory, I suppose.Tennessee Williams’ operatic Southern Gothic melodrama\u0026nbspconcerns Blanche DuBois, an ageing and deeply delusional ex-belle, who arrives in New Orleans to stay with her tirelessly patient sister Stella, only to find herself at war with her brother-in-law, the brutish, resentful Stanley Kowalski.Agreeably dark and even lurid at times, Streetcar was a safe choice for students due to its brooding adult themes and copious stage directions from the author, making it readily comprehensible and a neat introduction to stagecraft.Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire\u0026nbsp(Rex )However, it was always utterly excruciating to read aloud from as a class exercise, putting already awkward adolescents under pressure to imitate Marlon Brando or Vivien Leigh and attempt a period Louisiana\u0026nbspaccent without looking ridiculous in front of their smirking contemporaries.Aaah have always depended on the kindness of strangers...JB Priestley’s play assumes the guise of an Agatha Christie-esque\u0026nbspparlour whodunit as a means through which\u0026nbspto explore Edwardian class prejudice and hypocrisy.The great public intellectual of his day, Priestley has fallen oddly out of fashion of late, kept alive primarily by this very text being handed out to Britain’s school kids on the syllabus.Fans of the twist ending may nevertheless still prefer The Usual Suspects (1995).The Return of the Native (1878)Thomas Hardy saw classical tragedy wherever he looked and this tale of the ill-fated marriage\u0026nbspbetween free-spirited Eustacia\u0026nbspVye and\u0026nbspidealistic schoolmaster Clem Yeobright\u0026nbspamid the wilds of Egdon\u0026nbspHeath is no exception.Shorter than much of Dickens, this is as fine an entry point to the Victorian novel as any other - and packed with breezy comedy\u0026nbspcompared with\u0026nbspJude the Obscure (1895).Many students are still put off by Hardy’s curious melding\u0026nbspof grandiosity with folk detail and rustic humour and by his penchant for\u0026nbspheavy symbolism and ornate literary references.Realistically, how many finish it in time for their exams without resorting to skipping long passages or even just guessing the ending?Another quintessential Victorian “monster”, Emily Bronte’s\u0026nbspGothic romance about the tortured love affair between Catherine Earnshaw and the untamable\u0026nbspHeathcliff\u0026nbspon the wild and windy moors must have been foisted on everybody at some point.Wuthering Heights from 2011An extraordinary product of its young author’s fevered imagination, especially given the secluded life she and her prolific siblings led, Wuthering\u0026nbspHeights’ themes are sufficiently ghoulish to retain the interest but it\u0027s an unattractive group of villains on show to be sure.Kate Bush may or may not be a helpful teaching aid.Conventional wisdom insists that Shakespeare must be put before young teenagers to improve their minds but surely more are alienated by the difficulties of the language at that age than are turned on to his totemic histories, tragedies, comedies and sonnets.The idea that the Bard should be held for maturity like fine whiskey and cigars never seems to cut any ice though and so the same old hump through Romeo and Juliet (1597) and\u0026nbspMacbeth (1606) to the melancholy Prince of Denmark continues unabated.Hamlet is at least a malcontent and a wit and what interestingly gloomy teen has not practiced his famous soliloquy in front of the bathroom mirror?Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?DH\u0026nbspLawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Peshmerga recruits, some of whom are volunteers, aim their AK-47s as they take part in military training (AFPGetty)Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain.

While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people’s future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet.“Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning that a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy.”Theresa May has said voters should be “take reassurance and comfort” from\u0026nbspthe government’s no-deal planning, as details emerged over proposals to stockpile food, medicines and fuel in case supply chains are disrupted.More than 1.4m extra young people could vote in new Brexit referendumMP hits out at Labour members after losing no-confidence voteCan’t we, just for once, hear from some sensible Brexiteers?Students up and down the country support a second referendumHow the ‘Independent City State of Totnes’ hopes to stay in the EUUnder the plans, ministers are\u0026nbspconsidering drafting the army in to help deliver supplies to hard-to-reach areas\u0026nbspoutside of the southeast of England,\u0026nbspaccording to The Sunday Times.Supermarkets have already\u0026nbspdismissed suggestions that they stock up on\u0026nbspadequate food supplies\u0026nbspas “impractical”.The British Retail Consortium, the trade association,\u0026nbspsaid: “Retailers do not have the facilities to house stockpiled goods and, in the case of fresh produce, it is simply not possible to do so.“Our food supply chains are extremely fragile and this is yet further demonstration of the need for an agreement on the backstop to ensure frictionless trade is maintained after 29 March 2019.”Doctors have also warned that cancer patients could face potentially dangerous delays to their treatment if critical supplies of medical isotopes are held up at the border.Dr Jeanette Dickson, vice president of clinical oncology at the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “These medicines are like a burning fuse.\u0026nbsp“They start off with a certain amount of radioactivity and you have a set time to get them to hospital when they are still effective.

It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines.

Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns – again, on both sides – were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.A full account of The Independent’s view is available here.In 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it’s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal – before it’s too late.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/03/12/dripim.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3423216  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= dripim.jpg  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/03/12/dripim.jpg","title":"id cards brexit uk eu policy exchange david goodhart","story":"Created with Sketch.Critics are wary of implications for civil libertiesClick to followIndy PoliticsBring back ID cards after Brexit to avoid another Windrush scandal, argues think tankThe UK should consider introducing ID cards after Brexit to avoid another Windrush-style scandal, a think tank has said.ID cards are nothing new for EU citizens arriving in the UK, all of whom have to apply for registration documentation.But the think tank Policy Exchange suggested the\u0026nbspsystem should be extended to UK-born citizens. It argues that Brexit marks a natural point at which to reform the UK’s immigration system.ID cards cost £2m to decommissionID cards go up in flames in first step to tackle ‘database state’ID cards are a controversial topic, however, with opponents arguing that they infringe civil liberties.Tony Blair’s government brought in a £5bn ID card scheme in 2006 but\u0026nbspit was\u0026nbspscrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat\u0026nbspcoalition just four years later.David Goodhart, Policy Exchange’s head of demography, immigration and integration, said he believed\u0026nbspID cards were necessary – but acknowledged\u0026nbspthat people would be wary and said\u0026nbspID cards should be phased in voluntarily.\u0026nbsp“We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are,” said Mr Goodhart.“A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims,” he added.Other ideas put forward by Policy Exchange include reducing the cost of citizenship application fees and an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more.Such policies would de-incentivise illegal immigration, said\u0026nbspMr Goodhart.Your guide to immigration rhetoric The media have been impartial in their coverage of the \u0027immigration crisis\u0027Welcome to England: The Eastern European migrants were so determined to take advantage of the relaxed border controls that nothing, yes absolutely nothing, would act as a deterrent The Mail rightly points out the \u0027mass movement\u0027.

But they’ve got their work cut out for them: nobody wants to hear the verbal sewage coming out of a group whose only claim to fame is their rent-a-gob ex-leader.“Now they want dark elements of the far right in America to help plot their nasty agenda. The dangers stirred up by this kind of right-wing populism are obvious, but terrifying for the many people who fear history might be repeating itself.”A spokesperson for Ukip’s EFDD group told The Independent: “Steve Bannon certainly seems to offer a different perspective, and with his experience of American politics he could exert a large impact on the European scene which is currently going through quite a change.“Ukip MEPs wish to leave the EU in March 2019 and have no desire to return to its facade of democracy in Brussels. The MEPs will however be happy to share their experience with a new army of eurosceptic MEPs from a liberated UK.”Far-right, eurosceptic\u0026nbspand right-wing populist parties are currently scattered across a wide range of groups in the European parliament, including the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) – as well as parties with no group.\u0026nbspSuch parties are expected to make gains at EU level next year, as they have done in national elections since the last European parliament contest. Finding agreement between them to join a single group could be difficult, however, with many parties extremely cautious of their domestic image and loathe to ally with foreign parties that are seen as more extreme at home.\u0026nbspSome of the parties might turn their noses up at uniting under the leadership of an American organisation, too, as many have an anti-American political outlook.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/26/09/Israel-Gaza-airstrike.jpg","title":"gaza israel conflict what happening palestinian idf border jerusalem west bank","story":"Created with Sketch.United Nations has urged both sides to \u0027step back from the brink of war\u0027\u0026nbsp– your questions answered about latest flare-up in violence\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineA fireball exploding in Gaza City during Israeli bombardment on July 20  Q. Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Both have argued against strengthening the Palestinians’ international political clout until a peace settlement\u0026nbspis reached in the intractable Arab-Israeli conflict which agrees on the formation of an independent Palestinian state.\u0026nbspThe permanent Palestinian observer to the UN, Riyad Mansour, confirmed news of the Group 77 decision in a phone interview on Tuesday with The New York Times.\u0026nbspThe Palestinian mission to the UN was granted observer status in 2012, which made it eligible to join important bodies such as the International Criminal Court and Unesco.The Palestinians have used their membership of both agencies to further their push for statehood as well as file complaints about alleged Israeli human rights abuses\u0026nbspand settlement expansion in the West Bank.\u0026nbspPalestinian protesters clash with Israeli troops: in picturesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesThe move to give the Palestinians the chair of such a large delegation comes at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, sparked by the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, and a new, significant stumbling block in the peace process in the form of US president Donald Trump\u0027s\u0026nbspadministration.\u0026nbspMr Trump’s decision to fulfil an election campaign promise last December by recognising the contested city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked protests across the Muslim world.\u0026nbspIt also led the Palestinian Authority leadership to sever diplomatic relations with the US, declaring the White House could no longer be an “honest broker” between the two parties.\u0026nbspThe stalled negotiations do not sit well with Donald Trump, who has made Arab-Israeli peace – which he describes as “the ultimate deal” – a foreign policy priority.\u0026nbspIn an effort to force the Palestinians to the table, at the beginning of the year the US cut $65m\u0026nbsp(£49m) of an earmarked $125m\u0026nbspin funding to the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Unrwa.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

(Image: )David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integrationThe scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app and registration will cost no more than about \u0026pound75.The EU identity scheme should be seen as a trial run for a scheme that could include UK citizens too, said the Policy Exchange report.This could be the subject of a separate report, but it is worth noting how relatively simple and unobtrusive such a system could be.The system should not require a physical ID card, let alone the obligation to carry one as was the case in the second world war.The authors suggest it could initially be rolled out to UK citizens on a voluntary basis, with more people persuaded to take them up as they observed the benefits of easy access to services.It would also make it much harder for illegal immigrants to remain in limbo, said the report.That would in turn remove the need for the kind of hostile environment policy that caused the scandal of legal Caribbean immigrants known as the Windrush Generation facing deportation and losing their rights to jobs, housing and services after decades living in Britain, because they could not prove they were entitled to be here.Co-author David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integration, commented: We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.The report also calls for a more decisive process to remove failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, though there should be an amnesty to let those who have been in the UK illegally for more than 10 years and who are now part of their communities to regularise their status.The authors recommend more investment in border control including lorry scanners and staff.They want rail and ferry operators to be required to provide more advance information about passengers, as airlines already do.A single authority should be in charge of coastline border security, and Britain should work more closely with Irish authorities to stop the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area being exploited for illegal entry.Meanwhile, to reduce passport queues, they suggest Britain introduces a US-style of pre-travel Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, to enable non-UK citizens to use electronic e-gates at borders, and make it quicker for low risk groups to enter the country.The authors recommend more investment in border control including lorry scanners and staff. (Image: Policy Exchange)Mr Goodhart said: If people believe that their national borders are well-managed they are likely to worry less about the numbers crossing them.The coming end of free movement is an ideal time to invest more in a smoother, mainly digital border system.The UK is slipping behind the most innovative countries such as the US, Australia and Singapore.A Home Office spokesman said: We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform at the border as well as investing in new capability to improve passenger experience.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app. (Image: )Examples of this include e-Passport gates and motion detection technology which benefit passengers and improve security.Border Force invested \u0026pound63.5million in new technology and capability in 2017-18 and \u0026pound90.4million in the two previous years combined.Decisions on the future immigration system will be based on evidence.This is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the economic and social impacts of the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and also on how the UK\u0027s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/brexit-news-jacob-rees-mogg-996168.jpg","title":"Brexit news Jacob Rees Mogg opinion no deal Brexit","story":"Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg has lashed out at the government  (Image:  )The prominent Tory Brexiteer accused Theresa May\u0026rsquos Tories of deliberately using scare tactics in a desperate bid to bolster support for the prime minister\u0026rsquos Chequers deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister has said for a long time that no deal is better than a bad deal.\u0026ldquoIf the Government cannot now show that it can deliver a workable deal based on WTO terms then it is not competent.\u0026ldquoIt is not a good look for the Government to appear fretful, weak and incompetent, but this seems to be the way it is approaching the idea of leaving on WTO terms.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So what then?If Barnier and the sozzled Jean-Claude Juncker don’t like our proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice.No-deal is the only logical next step.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insists that we will be prepared for Brexit “come what may”. Good.We don’t want a hard border in Ireland. Nor do the Irish. But if the EU won’t budge, it may be unavoidable.Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s cosying up to Brussels and his anti-Brexit sabre-rattling is grossly misplaced.His country will be hit badly in the event of a no-deal.Let’s see how the Irish like that.THE Sun warned that the privacy ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard case would have a chilling impact on Press freedom and harm the pursuit of justice.Mr Justice Mann set a very dangerous precedent by suggesting those under police investigation should not be named in normal circumstances.Surprise, surprise! It took a week for us to get a legal letter citing the case to try to prevent publication of a story.A union official has been suspended for allegedly pleasuring themselves in their office and in public and uploading pictures of their activity online.The lawyers objected to us revealing the official’s name because they claimed an internal investigation was “private”.The judge’s ruling is a dangerous slide towards Press censorship, at the expense of YOUR right to know.Of course, the winners are the rich and powerful who can afford top lawyers to stop any scrutiny, regardless of the public interest.This terrible judgment must be appealed – and quickly.BRITS love to moan about the weather – usually about how wet and cold it is.But this week the complaints have been that it is too hot.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a private event in his constituency which had nothing to do with his role as Minister for Housing.“I put it on his diary card to be helpful though it really wasn’t my res­p­onsibility to sort things like that. Next day he was raging. He had called my line manager in a fit at 10pm. He was furious — he couldn’t find the address.“The door number was wrong, everything was a mess and he had hit the roof about his diary management. My line manager, his private secretary, knew the error had been made by another PA and it wasn’t my fault.“We tried to explain but he had no time to listen. He said, ‘I don’t care. There is an issue with diary management in this office’. I was made to feel small and undervalued. He seemed to be avoiding talking to me which created an awkward dynamic.“He had some kind of personal issue with me. In the end the other PA admitted it was her error. Even then, there was not a single apology or acceptance he made me doubt my capabilities and my place in that office. I felt bullied. I was distraught. I felt wrecked by the way he made me feel.“His inability to accept when he is wrong is a nasty characteristic. It’s typical Dominic Raab behaviour.”Rebecca said she was not the only one in the office treated cruelly by Mr Raab, who replaced David Davis as Brexit Secretary on the same day she was given her P45.She said: “There were days he would call other staff and scream at them down the phone. It reduced one of my colleagues to tears. He called her later to say, ‘Sorry, I was overworked and over-stressed’.“If he didn’t like the format of a briefing, he would just say, ‘I’m not going to read it’. I felt it was impossible to work with him. The way he spoke to others was short and sharp. He’d cut people off.”Rebecca’s claims are not the first time the Esher and Walton MP has faced a storm over his attitude.In 2011, he branded some feminists “obnoxious bigots”, claiming men were getting such a “raw deal” that it was time they “started burning their briefs”. His remarks put him at loggerheads with Prime Minister Theresa May.Rebecca went on: “He was notorious for going to the gym every day for one hour and 15 minutes. I had to fit that in no matter what. There were times when it was just not workable and I’d say, ‘I’m really sorry, I’ve had to cut five minutes off the gym because you have a really important meeting.“His reaction would be, ‘No, you don’t have authority over the diary. You ask me first and then I make that change’. I found it patronising. His responses were just rude.“His tone was aggressive. You’d be mid-sentence and he’d say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to hear from you’. Whatever your status, there is no need to be like that with anyone.”Dad-of-two Mr Raab also sometimes refused to walk to the Commons from his office.Rebecca said: “It was just a seven-minute walk, but he requested the daily use of the ministerial car.”She claims there were ­simmering tensions with the staff of other ministers in the department. She said: “If I asked Dominic to take on a commitment that others couldn’t, he’d say, ‘They all seem to think this is one big happy family. It’s not. It’s me and it’s them’. He was referring to the other junior ministers. That remark stands out.”Rebecca was suspended in April after a newspaper sting revealed she had met men via the sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement. At the time Mr Raab went on radio to dismiss the scandal as a “storm in a teacup”.Then Rebecca was dismissed for breaches of conduct — a humiliating end to a career which began when she joined the civil service at 16.Rebecca is now setting off on a round-the-world voyage. She said: “I’m excited for a new beginning. This chapter in my life has closed, and I’m ready for the next.”A source close to Mr Raab said last night: “Rebecca was dismissed according to an independent process. This is an attempt to cash in by smearing with false and malicious claims.”Rishi Sunak, who worked with Mr Raab as a junior housing minister, said: “Dom was a great colleague, supportive and collegiate. I have tremendous respect for him.”A Housing Ministry spokesman said: “We do not recognise these claims and they do not reflect the department’s experience — including those who worked directly with the minister in his private office.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The changes – which will be announced today following an eight-week consultation — will give “clear and consistent” guidelines and stop a potential boom of bogus claims for badges.Under the new rules, the badge will be extended to people who cannot undertake a journey without there being a risk of serious harm to their health or safety or that of any other person, such as young kids with autism.Others who will become eligible include those who cannot make a journey without suffering considerable psychological distress or have considerable difficulty walking.Minister for disabled people Sarah Newton said: “It is absolutely right that disabled people are able to go about their daily life without worrying how they will get from one place to another.“We’re taking an important step forward in ensuring people with hidden disabilities get the support they need to live independently.”National Autistic Society boss Jane Harris said the move would make a massive difference to the lives of many people.She said: “Just leaving the house is a challenge for many…involving overwhelming anxiety about plans going wrong.“The possibility of not being able to find a parking space near where you’re going can mean you can’t contemplate leaving the house at all. A Blue Badge will be a lifeline and prevent a life of isolation.”Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “This will be an absolute game changer for people living with dementia.It will bring great benefit to many of the 850,000 people currently living with dementia in the UK.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think some of the cast are from around the outskirts of Ascot.”Another local, who claimed to have met the cast at Ascot races, described them as “quite rough”.They added: “After meeting them [it seemed like a] very poor representation of Ascot - I hope the house prices dont decline.”On the Ascot People Facebook group, a community forum which has 10,000 members, many commented after spotting the crew filming on the local green and around supermarkets in the town.One person wrote: “One wrote: “I can see house prices dropping….”Another commented: “Dear God, could it get any worse?”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004193191431.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new mums should turn off the tv and have more cuddles with their babies to bring up healthy kids minister says","story":"Andrea Leadsom, who quit the Tory leadership race by implying Theresa May wasnt the right choice to be PM as she wasnt a mum, is launching proposals to boost care for young babies.The Leader of the Commons claimed that more new mums needed to bond physically with their babies by talking to them more, hugging them, smiling and stroking them.And that parents shouldnt rely on the TV to keep them occupied all the time.She told the Sunday Times as part of plans to set up advice sessions for new mums: Don’t let the television be the constant childminder.She added: Take time to turn the TV off and sit with your baby in the bouncer, look at your baby, count baby’s toes, stroke your baby at bathtime.Those are the things that develop the baby’s brain.Her comments come two years after she dramatically quit the Tory leadership race by comments she made implying Theresa May wasnt the right fit to be PM as she wasnt a mother.The mum-of-three said she had a stake in the future of Britain - but Mrs May has been unable to have kids with her husband Philip.Ms Leadsom previously set up the Parent Infant Partnership Charity to give psychological support to new families.The PM has asked her to help lead a committee to transform Sure Start centres and different types of support - including counselling for couples and help for mums with post-natal depression.“I recall when my baby cried, I would cry, she said.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

She spent days - maybe months - heroically struggling to survive as a castaway.Last week it was revealed Earhart did crash on a remote Pacific island where scientists claimed to have found her skeleton, according to a groundbreaking new study.The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) has painstakingly analysed the dozens of radio and distress signals picked up in the week after her plane vanished on July 2, 1937.Earhart, who was attempting to fly around the world, disappeared on the journey between Papua New Guinea to Howland Island with her navigator Fred Noonan.Human bones were found on the Pacific Island of Nikumaroro - around 2,000 miles from Hawaii - in 1940 but tests carried out by Dr David Hoodless on British Fiji initially concluded they belonged to a man.But scientists now believe this was a mistake and Richard Jantz, professor at the University of Tennessee, is convinced it belonged to Earhart.It was widely believed that her plane crashed and sank to the bottom of the ocean but Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR disputes that theory.After taking apart radio messages picked up by naval stations, one of which apparently heard the word Earhart, he claimed they were stranded on a reef for an entire week.Another station claimed they heard a woman saying we cant hold on and a third reported Earhart saying the plane went down on an uncharted island.She allegedly continued: Our plane is about out of gas. Water all around. Very dark,’ before going on to mention a storm and winds blowing.Gillespie said the last transmissions came on July 7, at around midnight, when one woman claims to have heard someone saying: Can you read me? This is Amelia Earhart. This is Amelia Earhart. Please come in.The skeleton has since been lost but Dr Janz has compared their recorded measurements to the probable dimensions of Earharts and reached a remarkable conclusion.He said: What I can say scientifically is that they are 99 per cent likely to be her.Dr Jantz estimated the dimensions of comparable bones in Earharts body by analysing photos where she appeared alongside objects which can still be measured today.He said: We had the lengths of three bones that Hoodless reported lengths for.Then we realised there were some ways we could get more information about Amelia Earharts dimensions that could be compared directly to the bones.Dr Janzs team measured the length of her humerus and radius bones from a photo that had a scalable object in it.He said: Then we also had her a good estimate of her tibia length which we got from her trouser inseam length and from her height.We were able to compare the three bone lengths from Nikumaroro island to Amelia Earhart.The result is that they are very similar and its unlikely that just a random person would be that similar.An analysis comparing the Nikumaroro bones to those of 2,776 other people found only 17 people with dimensions more similar than Earhart - just two of them women.Dr Janz said: If her position had been in the middle of that distribution, there is no way I could have concluded that it was her.The fact that she is not the closest one is not disqualifying at all, because there are going to be measurement errors on my part from estimating her dimensions, and it could be that Hoodless also made some errors.Just a random person would have a very low probability of being that similar to the Nikumaroro bones.Other products from 1930s America have also been found on the island.And there’s also evidence that Amelia made more than 100 cries for help in radio transmissions between July 2 and July 6 of the year she went missing, which rules out her plane crashing without warning.The radio would not have worked if the plane’s engine was not running.The astonishing discovery raised the prospect of the aviator finally returning home after all this time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000278667964.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"household bins to be emptied just once every three weeks under new recycling plan","story":"The government is clamping down on wasteful Britons by scaling back collections in an effort to please EU environmental chiefs.Just 45 per cent of households recycled in 2016 which is just off the target of 50 per cent demanded by Brussels.It is hoped that by cutting back collections people will be forced to recycle - rather than just dumping all of their rubbish in the same bin each week.The three-week wait has been proposed by a number of authorities including Guildford in Surrey, East Devon, St Helens on Merseyside, Oldham and Rochdale.While Wigan adopted the strategy last year.Bosses have defended the cutbacks with a new report claiming that reducing collections does not lead to fly-tipping, according to the Sunday Times.The report states: “As the evidence builds to show the scale of the savings and performance improvements, it is reasonable to expect that an increasing number of councils will opt for less frequent residual waste collections.”In North Devon a trial of the three-week system last year found that out of 3,400 homes the proportion of household rubbish going to a landfill fell from 77 per cent to 41 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000279248754.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mh370 flight mystery deepens final report","story":"A 495 page report by the Malaysian government shows the aircraft, which went missing on March 8, 2014, was under manual control when it deviated before plunging into the Indian Ocean killing 239 people.One of the theories is that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately downed the plane, which was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, in an act of murder-suicide.However today’s report by the official safety investigation team has not assigned blame to any individuals and has not been able to determine why the plane changed course and eventually crashed - leaving the mystery unsolved.The Malaysian government will only re-open their investigation if new evidence emerges.Chief investigator Dr Kok Soo Chon told reporters that his team believe the Malaysian Airlines plane was under manual control and was intentionally downed.He said: We cannot establish if the aircraft was flown by anyone other than the pilot.“We can also not exclude the possibility that there’s unlawful interference by a third party, reports News.au.WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR:Speaking about why the aircraft deviated thousands of miles from its course, he said: “The autopilot has to be disengaged,” reports Adelaide Now.He continued: “It has to be on manual. We have carried out seven simulator tests, flight simulators, three at high and four at low speed and we found the turn was made indeed under a manual, not autopilot.”Dr Kok said the investigators examined the history of the pilot and the first officer and were satisfied with their background, training and mental health.A 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau showed that pilot Zaharie had used his own flight simulator six weeks before the crash to fly a route which was initially similar to the one taken by MH370.However, Malaysian authorities concluded that the flight simulations were game-related and that there was was no unusual activities on the simulator.The final report today said that the co-pilots flight simulator was seized from his home but that nothing suspicious was found on it.Kok said his team “couldn’t find any flaws with the aircraft” and that “everything seemed OK” with it.He added that the cause of the disappearance cannot be determined until the plane and its black boxes are found, saying the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found.The report said there was no sign the plane was evading radar detection or that it was taken over by remote control.No irregularities were found in the on-board cargo, which included items like lithium batteries and about 2,500 kgs of mangosteen which is a tropical fruit.The independent investigation report highlighted shortcomings in the governments response.Dr Kok said the probe showed lapses by air traffic control, including a failure to swiftly initiate an emergency response and monitor radar continuously, relying too much on information from Malaysia Airlines and not getting in touch with the military for help.The plane is presumed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean.However, the report said there was insufficient information to determine if the aircraft broke up in the air or during impact with the ocean.Scattered pieces of debris that washed ashore on African beaches and Indian Ocean islands indicated a distant remote stretch of the ocean where the plane likely crashed.But a government search by Australia, Malaysia and China failed to pinpoint a location.And a second, private search by US company Ocean Infinity that finished at the end of May also found no sign of the wreckage.Hard copies of the long-awaited and unedited report were distributed to families of those on-board the flight earlier today.Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the team also briefed relatives of the victims on the report at the transport ministry.However, next of kin looked distraught after receiving the report while insisting the document offered them “no closure”,  reports.Many of the heartbroken relatives reportedly said some of the information contained in the report was incorrect.Others reported that while there were no major surprises the report contained more details as to the extent in which Air Traffic Control allegedly “messed up”.Captain Zaharies friend Peter Chong, who is also a pilot, said in a Facebook post that he feels disappointment over the report and the lack of closure for the grieving relatives.He wrote: I feel sad for the Next of Kin (NOK) of MH370. After all the hype and expectations, the Report released brings forth nothing new.They are no where near to closure.Just another round in the emotional rollercoaster ride.I am happy to note there is no blame apportioned to anyone.However, there is also no answers as to what happened to the flight.Earlier, Mr Loke told reporters that “every word recorded by the investigation team (has been) tabled in this report”.“It (was) tabled fully, without any editing, additions, or redactions,” he said.Grace Nathan, whose mother was on the flight, responded to the release of the report on Facebook. “Just because they call it a final report doesn’t mean it’s over for the next of kin,” she wrote today.“The search must go on. There can be no final report until MH370 is found.”On May 29, Malaysia called off a three-month search by Ocean Infinity, which spanned 43,243 sq miles in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with 239 people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at 12.14am on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH370 close to Phuket island, Thailand, in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Malaysian captain Zaharie Amad Shah was flying MH370 when it disappeared.Shah, born July 31, 1961, was described as a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981.A father of three, passionate cook and keen fisherman, Shah lived with his wife in a luxury gated community where he was said to have built his own flight simulator.In the wake of the planes disappearance, rumours surfaced claiming his wife had moved out of their home.The co-pilot was Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was on his first flight on a 777 as a fully approved first officer.He had flown five times before with a check co-pilot overseeing him.But he had 2,763 hours experience flying other jets before moving to the larger aircraft.Fariq was reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend."},{"url":null,"title":"cheeky chef gets revenge on 60 rude customers by serving up naughty dessert","story":"Anton Lofthouse, 34, had the large party booked in for a three course meal last week at a pub in South London.But when they showed up over an hour-and-a-half late without apologising, Anton decided to serve them up their just desserts.He arranged the two scoops of ice cream together and then squirted on the chocolate sauce in a phallic shape.Despite his cheeky stunt being spotted by colleagues, the customers all tucked in without complaint.Anton, who has been head chef at the unnamed establishment for seven months, said: We only have a tiny kitchen and there was only myself in there so three courses for 60 people is a massive job for one person.But they turned up an hour and a half late and offered no apologies or anything like that and they were a bit of a nightmare.So I decided to have a bit of fun.There were two other staff working that night, one being my general manager and both noticed straight away.

We had security with us just in case things went wrong.The door-knock was petrifying. I cant fully describe it because the emotions are so up and down, the adrenaline definitely kicked in.Prosecuting, Rob Welling confirmed that Jarvis used his hidden smartphone to go online, where he had set up a number of profiles, often using a girls name.At the end of May, Jarvis made contact with a girl and made suggestive comments to her.He then arranged to meet the youngster and, though she turned up, he did not meet her so there was no contact.The court heard that, earlier that month, he was also contacting two girls Facebook profiles which were decoys set up by the paedophile hunter group.Mr Welling also said that Jarvis was given a suspended sentence on April 20.And he said his defendant and was made subject to a sexual harm prevention order which said he must have safety software on any hardware which could connect to the internet.As well as the suspended sentence imposed in April, he was put on a sex offender programme in 2010 for trying to take pictures of a child.He was also spared jail in 2004 after he stalked a teenage girl as she walked home at night in Gorse Hill and pinned her against her door and sexually assaulted her.Jarvis pleaded guilty to breaching a sexual harm prevention order and attempted sexual communication with a child.Jailing him, Judge Robert Pawson said: This breach was flagrant, it was quite deliberate by you.You had that phone in order to make contact with children for sexual purposes.

Over the next few months things got harder. I felt completely trapped and gradually more out of control.My days were spent obsessively exercising, skipping as many meals as possible and either ending the day with a massive family row or eating dinner really quickly then heading upstairs to make myself sick.I used to sit in my therapy sessions being told that my body was falling apart and I was losing the fat round my organs. But I didn\u0027t believe anyone telling me this. I thought they were just jealous I had a best friend who made me feel so good.It spiralled out of control so fast that months after my first appointment at child and adolescent mental health services my heart nearly stopped and I was admitted to a mental health hospital where I spent the next year of my life recovering.It was the hardest year of my life: revisiting past experiences, learning to talk about my feelings and learning to accept that I needed help.After that year in hospital, I had developed a handbook of coping mechanisms - including learning to talk about how I felt, challenging myself around food, and getting rid of all emotions.But my biggest frustration was that people still thought your anorexia must be completely gone if you were a healthy weight.That is not the reality. There is so much more to recovery than gaining physical weight.Recovery isn\u0027t always a straight line either. You have to learn what triggers to watch out for, and to be aware if it gets tough again.As we entered in to 2016 I was feeling positive about life. I barely thought about my anorexia and I certainly didn\u0027t let her dictate what I did.But after my grandma passed away, anorexia used it as a reason to seduce me. She pulled me in when I was feeling weak and grieving, sucking me closer and closer. After four months of battling with this relentless voice in my head I reached out for help. I got an appointment at my local mental health trust, but because I wasn\u0027t underweight there was nothing they could do for me.My story isn\u0027t unique. In fact there are countless people who get turned away for not being \"thin\" enough, or not fitting a specific criteria. It isn\u0027t right or fair that this is still happening - and it means people with eating disorders aren\u0027t getting the treatment they need to prevent them getting worse.After I came through my relapse I decided that I needed to help others, so I wrote a book, Stand Tall Little Girl, and I began doing talks about mental health."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-eu-flag_4331103.jpg?20180608170915 ","title":"public opinion is shifting sharply against brexit sky data poll reveals","story":"More than three-quarters of the British public - 78% - now think the government is doing a bad job negotiating Brexit, up 23 percentage points from when last asked in March this year.Just 10% think they are doing a good job - down 13 points.

Jenna Langston, 33, spotted the infant in the baking hot car and raced to help him by forcing open the boat and then opening the doors from the inside. The little boy was soaked in sweat and had been left alone in the car for at least half an hour before Jenna arrived on the scene at the Asda store in Barnes Hill, Birmingham. Emergency services rushed to the supermarket and the baby was taken to hospital. Jenna, who works as a care manager, was at the store to buy her favourite egg custards when she saw the baby, believed to be just three months old, in the back of the car.  She told Birmingham Live : I saw a guard standing by a black car and initially thought: \u0027I hope no-one\u0027s left a dog in there.\u0027 I had already heard a tannoy announcement giving a registration plate while I was inside the store and quite a bit of time had passed since then. But a guard said a baby was inside. I dropped my shopping and ran over to the car. I said the baby needed to come out straight away - it was 31C. But the guard said they couldn\u0027t break in because it would be classed as breaking and entering. I said I didn\u0027t care and I was going to get the baby out. The guard said: \u0027We can\u0027t help you do that. I could lose my job.\u0027 All the doors were locked and none of the windows were open. I forced the boot and threw bags and everything else out to get access to the baby. I got myself into the boot and put my top half over the back seat. He was dripping with sweat - his babygrow was like it had been through the washing machine. I opened the doors to let some air in and someone else asked if I wanted to sit in their car with the baby as it had air conditioning. Then the police and paramedics arrived. I handed the baby over to the ambulance crew. They said he seemed fine but they had to take him to hospital. There was still no sign of the car driver - it had been around 50 minutes by now.

Golden sands stretching miles into the distance, sunshine glinting off the bright blue sea, the lights and bustle of a thriving coastal city 100ft below. It could easily be a spectacular view of one of Florida’s famous beachfronts. But this is our very own Miami - Bournemouth. With more than \u0026pound100million of investment ploughed into the resort in recent years, it’s a title that’s far from ridiculous. But while new, upmarket hotels have been built, along with a multi-million pound entertainment complex and infrastructure improvements across the seafront, Bournemouth has lost none of the charm and appeal that makes a British seaside holiday so endlessly appealing. Beach huts line the seafront, with locals and tourists alike soaking up the sunshine and atmosphere.  David and Diana Cox are visiting from Kettering, Northants and rent their beach hut, every summer, for \u0026pound170 a week. “I’ve been coming here for more than 20 years,” says David, 79, a retired enginer. “It’s a truly fabulous place. There is sea and sun, a diverse population – the good, gritty stuff that makes Britain great. “We come to swim in the sea and eat grilled fish and watch a pretty world roll by. The shops aren’t too shabby, either.” His 72-year-old wife, Diana, who used to work for Sainsbury’s, agrees. “Bournemouth is a proper little idyll. There’s something here for everybody – it’s just posh enough but it’s also just working class enough.” From Scarborough to Blackpool, and Weymouth to Bournemouth, the UK has a proud tradition of working-class seaside resorts that, frankly, knocks the socks and sandals of our European rivals.  The food is – these days, finally – better, the loos are cleaner and the beer is definitely colder. What’s not to like? Oh, and let’s not forget, at last we also have the weather. This on-off heatwave has, despite the short-lived weekend dip (don’t worry, August 1 puts us right back on the heatwave track), left us matching Miami’s temperatures too. Bournemouth’s long and generous beach – the most photographed in the UK – is only part of the draw. There are two historic piers to explore: Bournemouth Pier has become a playground for adrenaline-fuelled adventures with a zip-wire running from pier to shore and an indoor high wire and climbing centre Boscombe Pier is less white-knuckle affair offering a charming musical trail featuring giant chimes and mini golf with edible golf balls that drop into the sea on the final hole and feed the fish.  Psychiatric nurse Margaret Butler, 56, owns her beach hut and lives locally, and says she’s here “to swim, in Britain’s best weather”. She adds: “All of us are better people, I think, when we’re beside the seaside – the sounds, the views, the smell of it all. And Britain is under-rated as a holiday destination. Why? We are brilliant. We are a kind and generous people with a fabulous coastline and a properly decent spirit.” Something the almost 7 million visitors last year surely agreed with. This summer seaside influx is a British tradition, people flocking to the cooler temperatures and simple pleasures of the seaside. Tourism is booming across the whole of the UK with 40 million foreign visitors expected this year – a record figure. Tourist promotion agency VisitBritain has predicted that overseas trips to the UK will increase 6% to 39.7 million, with spending up by 14% to \u0026pound25billion a year. Britons are also holidaying at home in record numbers. Tourism is now worth \u0026pound127bn annually to the economy.  The UK has become a cheaper place to visit for tourists from overseas, following the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. However, during the first six months of last year there were a record 23.1 million overseas visits to the UK – up 8% on the same period in 2016 – and the figures for July last year topped four million for the first time, with only a slightly smaller number of visits made during August. Britain’s beaches have also attracted more staycationers and, with temperatures predicted, next month, to beat 2003’s record 38.5C, why even consider the hassle of foreign travel. Back on Bournemouth’s beach, Natalie Walford, 24, Fii (CORR) Smith, 23, and Lauren Sturgiss, also 23, are probably, the youngest people on the beach. Natalie, who is down from Brixton, London, says: “This is the best place in the world. Who would argue?” Certainly not Terry Keenan, 68, a dedicated Mirror reader. There is a copy of today’s paper on the floor of his beach hut. He is here with his family: his daughter Johanna, son-in-law Tim, both 37 and his grandchildren, Sebastian, six, and Zara, four . Tim and co are from Hampshire but Terry lives here. “Bournemouth is free-thinking but wild and, yes, just free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"chef gets subtle revenge party","story":"NewsChef gets subtle revenge on party of rude customers - can you spot it?Anton Lofthouse, 34, decided revenge was a dish best served cold after the insulting behaviourShare\u0026nbspByDavid Keane11:54, 30 JUL 2018NewsThere was something amiss about the desserts the customers received (Image: Kennedy News and Media)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA cheeky chef decided revenge is a dish best served cold after a rude party of customers acted in an insulting way. Anton Lofthouse, 34, made all their ice cream deserts into the shape of a PENIS. He is head chef at a south London pub and had a large party of 60 pre-booked for a three course meal last week. But he was fuming when they turned up more than an hour-and-a-half late and did not apologise. The chef, originally from Middlesbrough, playfully arranged the two scoops of ice cream together and then squirted on the chocolate sauce in a sausage shape - creating a phallic shape for those looking carefully. Despite his cheeky stunt being spotted by colleagues while serving, it appeared to go unnoticed by the customers who ate it without complaint.  Anton, who has been head chef at the unnamed venue for seven months, said: A large party of 60 people were booked in. When such a large group are booked in we can\u0027t serve food to anyone else so had to close to the general public. We only have a tiny kitchen and there was only myself in there so three courses for 60 people is a massive job for one person. But they turned up an hour and a half late and offered no apologies or anything like that and they were a bit of a nightmare. So I decided to have a bit of fun. They had asked for ice cream and stipulated that they wanted it in a big bowl rather than the small tubs we traditionally serve them in. But in a big bowl there is a lot of space left and obviously they also wanted chocolate sauce on it.

The shocking life expectancy gap in Stockton-on-Tees, in County Durham, is laid bare in a BBC documentary highlighting the desperation of those facing ill health and death from a comparatively early age. According to Public Health England, Stockton is the town with the country\u0027s largest gap in health and life expectancy.  A man can expect to live to 64, the same age as a man in Ethiopia. Rob Hill, a father of eight, tells interviewers that he is preparing for death at 46 after being diagnosed with numerous health problems. He suffers from emphysema, lymphedema and type 2 diabetes - among other health conditions.  Rob claims poor life choices, including an unhealthy diet and a lifetime of smoking, has left him with a bleak future. Speaking to BBC\u0027s Panorama , Rob said: I\u0027ve made a few bad choices. Smoking - the worst choice I ever made in my life. Seeing my kids cry, that\u0027s horrible. Seeing them sitting there and crying and listening to my children turn around and say, \u0027my dad is going to die soon and I\u0027m not going to play with him any more\u0027. Rob\u0027s eight-year-old son Harvey told the investigative programme: When dad comes into the kitchen, I just see him coughing all the time.  And then I just end up going away. I don\u0027t stay in the kitchen. I don\u0027t know, like no-one ever knows when he\u0027s going to be gone. No one does, not even the doctor. Rob goes on to describe how his younger children are used to playing with him while he is hooked up to breathing apparatus at home. In his hometown, those living in wealthier areas can live 18 years longer than those living in poorer parts of the town, according to national statistics.

Pam and Gerald Patterson had always known they wanted to help children stuck in the care system - so they began what became a family affair by adopting four kids with Down\u0027s - James, now 32, Alice, 28, Molly, 26 and Riley, 10. They admit their lives are very different to those of their friends, as they struggle to have as much time for themselves. But Pam said they wouldn\u0027t change anything - and say their children are what \u0027keeps them active\u0027 as their lives are consumed with taking them here and taking them there. Incredibly, Pam\u0027s brother Roger Bull and his wife Leigh then also adopted two kids with the chromosomal disorder, David and Timothy, who are now 35 and 28, and also foster four-year-old Marie. Then the latest addition to the ever-growing family is six-year-old Isabel and twin three-year-olds George and Tomas, who also have Down\u0027s and were adopted by Roger\u0027s daughter Jenny.  The Pattersons went to social services in the 1980s and asked to only adopt children with the condition. Both had volunteered with kids with Down\u0027s and knew that most would-be adopters wouldn\u0027t look twice at those with a disability. Pam, 60, said: We knew straight away that we would only adopt children with Down\u0027s Syndrome. It was what I\u0027d always wanted to do. Having a family full of children with the condition has made our lives so much richer.  It\u0027s challenging, but it\u0027s the route we chose to take. We chose knowing that what we\u0027re taking on, we\u0027re taking on forever. And touchingly, her husband Gerald, 62, added: I couldn\u0027t have gone for any other disability. Straight away we loved them all so much. The family\u0027s incredible link to adoption began in 1984 when Pam\u0027s brother Roger, 65, and wife Leigh, 61, decided to adopt a child with Down\u0027s. They took on David at five months old and adopted him in 1984 through social services in Birmingham. They then went on to have biological daughter Jenny, 33, before adopting Timothy, who has the syndrome, at six-months old in 1990.  Their family was completed by another of their own biological children, Matthew, 23, who is now a part-time carer for his two brothers. Inspired by her brother, Pam told Gerald she\u0027d also like to adopt a child with Down\u0027s and brought seven-month-old James home in 1985. Then followed 12-week-old Alice in 1989, and Molly, then aged almost three in 1996. Incredibly - and despite being in their mid 50s - the couple took on another child Riley, then almost three, in 2012. Before adopting, the couple had their own children, Emma, 38, and Chris, 34, who love their somewhat unusual family set-up.  Inspired by her parents and aunt and uncle, Pam\u0027s childless niece Jenny decided to take the plunge and also adopt a child with Down\u0027s, becoming mother to four-month-old Isabel in 2012. Jenny loved the experience so much she fostered and then became the legal  of newborns George and Tomas in 2016 when they were a year old. The amazing family all live within a few miles of each other in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and say their lives have been made infinitely better by their adoptive children. Pam and Gerald were childhood sweethearts and began volunteering at the Gateway Club in Birmingham, which caters for children with special needs, in the 1970s. There, Pam met Leigh, who she introduced to her brother Roger.  With both couples having extensive knowledge of the needs of children with Down\u0027s from working at the club, they knew that many were given up at birth or not long after because of the immense commitment of caring for them. And they made a pact to adopt only kids with Down\u0027s because so many needed loving homes. At school I helped at a special school instead of doing sport, which I hated, Pam smiled. It\u0027s so rewarding. You get what you put in. They achieve because you put in the effort. Down\u0027s Syndrome is a disorder arising from a chromosome defect where those affected have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the cells of their body. It causes intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities including short stature and a broad facial profile.  Ex-nurse Pam said the adoption had made her life very different to those of her friends, but she wouldn\u0027t change it for the world. If we hadn\u0027t adopted then I would have worked until retirement, it would have taken us down a totally different path, she admits. But I wouldn\u0027t change it for the world. When we look at our friends who haven\u0027t got children with special needs our lives are very different, there\u0027s no comparison. They\u0027re having weekends away in hotels, going on cruises and going out for meals - we still go out in the evening but we have to find a sitter. It\u0027s what keeps us active because otherwise life would become pottering in the garden or going for a walk but now our lives are consumed with taking them here and taking them there. Pam says her own children have always been supportive of their adopted siblings - although they were initially reticent about Riley\u0027s adoption- who was oxygen-dependent, had heart problems and was on a lot of drugs - as it had been 16 years since the last one, but he soon won them over.  When Gerald first met him at his foster home, Riley said There\u0027s my daddy! as he burst through the door. Retired Pam insists: We were at home anyway so we might as well be at home with one more! Today, Riley\u0027s progress is nothing short of miraculous. His heart has been repaired and he\u0027s expected to live well past his teens. Pam added: Emma and Chris don\u0027t know any different, they don\u0027t see James, Alice, Molly and Riley any differently. I am pretty sure that as far as they are concerned they have only made their lives richer. And former police officer Gerald says: They\u0027re just people - they enjoy the same things as you and I. It\u0027s given us a completely new lease of life, we do things now that we\u0027d never have done. In addition, Pam sometimes worries about what will happen to her children when, eventually, she and Gerald die.  Some adults with Down\u0027s syndrome can live alone but Pam hopes her adopted children will continue to live in their family home with carers. Now the family have regular meetups where things can get pretty boisterous with the younger children. Alice and Riley both enjoy gymnastics and will represent Great Britain in the Down\u0027s Syndrome International competition in Germany in July. Riley also attends Beavers. According to Jenny, her brother Timothy is the wild one of the bunch - he has flown in a four-seater plane and wants to learn to ski. The family share a love of Derby County Football Club, attending every home game with their season tickets. James\u0027 passion for football has given him much more than a chance to watch his favourite players - he used it as a way of learning to read and write. The twins attend nursery and will join Isabel and Riley at a special needs school in the local town next year.

Harry and Meghan are set to attend the wedding of Charlie Van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks in the village of Churt, Surrey on Saturday. Charlie is one of the prince\u0027s best friends and subsequently Harry is going to be taking on the role of best man on the big day - meaning Meghan will have to sit by herself. Last year the duchess spent her birthday on an African safari with Harry. Her husband, 33, and Charlie, 30, met while attending Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire. They formed a strong friendship, with Charlie and his brother Thomas being ushers at the Duke of Sussex\u0027s wedding in May.   His brother was also selected to be Princess Charlotte\u0027s godfather in 2015.   Both Charlie and Prince William are said to have roasted Harry in a speech during his wedding reception at Frogmore House.   According to The Sunday Times , Charlie made a joke about Harry being a dorm monitor at their school.  He said: All I wanted was a cuddle from my mummy, instead Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out on to the roof.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Jenny Clough, 32, and her son Jack, five, were in the Pen Cob restaurant in Pwllheli, Wales, when she claims another customer told her to leave. The mum-of-one arrived at the pub at around 2pm on Monday, July 23, and shortly afterwards Jack became overwhelmed. The pair, who are from Manchester, were enjoying visiting family in Llanaelhaearn during the first week of the summer holidays.  Miss Clough, an administrator for the NHS, told the Daily Post : “Jack was just making a bit of noise and it hadn’t gone on for longer than 30 to 60 seconds when a man walked over and said we should leave.  “I explained that Jack is autistic and I asked him to just give me a minute to calm him down but he responded by saying it wasn’t his f***ing problem and said he was trying to have a nice meal with his wife.  “I couldn’t believe it was happening, nothing like this has ever happened before. “He was looking at Jack and speaking about him like he was nothing, it was very upsetting. “I know my son and I knew by the noise he was making that it wasn’t going to be a full on tantrum, I knew I could calm him down. “If it had been going on for 10 minutes I might understand but it was 60 seconds at most.” Miss Clough said she became even more defensive over her son when the man said that his wife had “one of them at home”.  “I was sobbing by this point,” she said. “I didn’t swear but I told him I thought he was a horrible man. I felt he was bullying me and my son, he was just glaring at us” “Not one member of staff said anything,” she added. Miss Clough says she contacted the Wetherspoons after the incident and spoke to the manager who apologised. “I accept their apology. I have no problem with the staff members at all”, she said.  “I’ve been to this Wetherspoons before and the staff have always been lovely. “My problem is with this individual, who was actually sitting five or six tables away from us anyway. “I understand that he is entitled to have a nice meal with his wife but Wetherspoons is family friendly - there were other children there making just as much noise. “I’ve never sobbed like that or been that emotional in my life. “It took me a long time to get to the point where I didn’t care what people thought and this has set me back.

Stacey Louise Ball, who is six months pregnant, feared she would suffer permanent sight loss after losing the ability to see for two days when she had a horror reaction to fake lashes - causing her eyelids to swell and fill with puss. The 22-year-old has been getting false lashes at the same salon for three years without problem, but because of the heatwave, she went to a closer salon. As soon as she got home, her eyes started swelling and she was left with itchy eyes oozing with green gunk - that caused her to completely lose vision in her right eye for two days.  She said: The heat was just too much for me being six months pregnant so that\u0027s why I decided to try a new place which was closer. I thought I would ignore it at first but it got really bad. It was really scary and I thought I was going blind. My eye was just getting worse and worse. I lost my vision for two days and I was getting by with my left eye but everything was so blurry, I could barely see out of it. I didn\u0027t want to go blind. Stacey, from Thamesmead, south east London, paid \u0026pound23 to have her eyebrows tinted and false lashes put on at the salon on July 19, which is just a 15-minute walk from her house.  The beautician asked Stacey if she\u0027d had a patch test and because she said she had one at a different shop, didn\u0027t offer her one. After spending ten minutes on her brows, the beautician left Stacey in the chair while she tended to another customer before returning to take another thirty minutes applying the false eye lashes. Stacey was surprised when the beautician put masking tape under her eyelids and the false lashes on top as she is used to having them being applied under her lashes at her regular salon in Woolwich, south east London. She said: I must have sat in the chair for at least half an hour where the lady took so long to do my lashes. In my local shop it takes ten to fifteen minutes maximum. It felt different and the eye lashes didn\u0027t feel comfortable. The lady got glue in my eye and I remember she was wiping it and it got really sore.  When she got home, her eyes started hurting and the next morning when she woke her eyes were stuck together and she had to prise them open. The beauty lover spoke to an emergency doctor who prescribed her eye drops but they didn\u0027t work and she went back to the GP who then referred her to Moorfields Eye Hospital in central London. She said: When I thought I couldn\u0027t see, I went to the doctor\u0027s straight away. I was waking up with my eyes completely glued together and a lot of gunky stuff was coming out.

It was a Clearblue test and it came out negative. At this point Michaela was confused - but remembered she had the other Asda test in her cupboard. After testing with the Asda branded test, she then got a second positive result. I bought two more Asda and two more Clearbue and the Asda ones came out positive and the Clearblue came out negative she said. My mind was all over the place. I called the doctors and made a midwife appointment. I didn\u0027t really know what was happening. I had to wait a week to see the midwife and when I did she said getting a false positive was extremely rare and that there was no point in testing my blood.

But researchers now believe they know what happened to the pioneering aviator and her navigator after they vanished while trying to fly around the world in 1937. Earhart, 39, had already become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean five year earlier. It was believed she had crashed into the sea after her plane, Electra, developed engine problems. But now experts have analysed Earhart\u0027s final distress calls which reveal clues which may shed light on what really happened.  Ric Gillespie believes he has proof that Earhart crash-landed on a remote South Pacific island about 2,000 miles from Hawaii - and called for help for nearly a week before her plane was swept out to sea. Gillespie, who has researched the case for more than 30 years, says the distress calls were heard around the world - and prompted the Navy to launch a rescue mission.  He told CBS News : It took the battleship a week to get there, by which time the radio signals had stopped, and when the planes flew over the island, they didn\u0027t see an airplane.  Gillespie said the calls were also heard by dozens of people who unexpectedly picked up Earhart\u0027s transmissions on their radios thousands of miles away.  Calls for help were reportedly heard in Florida, Iowa, Texas and even Canada, where a woman said she heard a voice saying we have taken in water. … We can\u0027t hold on much longer. Gillespie\u0027s organisation also re-examined bones first discovered in 1940 after they were washed up on the tiny atoll of Nikumaroro part of the nation of Kiribati. And they think Earhart lived out her final days as a castaway stranded in the middle of the Pacific.  The International Group for Historic Aircraft Discovery based in Philadelphia has been trying to prove the bones uncovered belong to the American pilot since 1998, and how they “appear consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin”. The bones had been previously confirmed to have belonged to a castaway, and not the victim of a plane crash. A comprehensive study of the Nikumaroro area showed bonfires had been lit and fish bones left around by someone living on the atoll. “There is an entire final chapter of Earhart’s life that people don’t know about. She spent days - maybe months - heroically struggling to survive as a castaway,” Gillespie said.  Despite speculation in 1940 that the remains were those of Earhart, British authorities rejected the claim after a doctor concluded that the bones were from a male. The bones were subsequently lost but the doctor’s files were uncovered in 1998 and included the skeletal measurements, which showed that the length of the forearm was larger than average. The aircraft recovery group has now re-examined the doctor’s findings comparing the ratio of the skeleton’s upper and lower arm bones to that from a clear photograph of Earhart standing in a short-sleeved top and concluded that the two ratios were “virtually identical”. Jeff Glickman, a forensic imaging specialist consulted by the group, examined the length of two bones - the radius and humerus - in Earhart’s left arm and found the ratio was 0.76.

He worked every hour God sent so he could give Meghan the life he wanted for her. “Sixteen-hour days were normal. Tom used to work well into the night. “The spare time he had off he’d sleep for a little while but then spend every minute he could with Meghan before going back to work. “After a while, such long hours take their toll and Tom would use drugs that helped him work for longer. Coffee just didn’t cut it.” Thomas did not specify which drugs he used in his interview with the Mail on Sunday. But his daughter Samantha said last night \u0026shymarijuana was popular at the time he worked in Hollywood. She added: “My father is upstanding and doesn’t really drink and he doesn’t do recreational drugs.  “But in the 60s, 70s and 80s for most people I know in America it was a cultural thing to smoke marijuana. “Most people did. I’m sure people like The Beatles smoked pot when they were on tour. It was a sign of the times. I don’t think my father is the only one who can ever have been condemned for having done that. He was never regularly doing it, he never smelt of it and I’ve never seen my father smoke it. “But certainly my father has never taken cocaine or any other drugs like that. He didn’t have the mentality for it. “He was a really successful lighting director which required very sharp visuals and attention to detail. “If he had been a drug addict he wouldn’t have been successful for 40 years in a highly technical job, no way.” Meghan was unaware of her dad’s drugs past. A friend told how Thomas, who is recovering from heart surgery which stopped him going to his \u0026shydaughter’s royal wedding in May, now “feels completely cut off” from her. The pal added: “He used to have Meghan’s number but now if he tries it’s dead. She, or the Palace, have changed them all. Only last week he mentioned it was Meghan’s birthday this Saturday, but he has no idea how to send her a card. We joked he should turn up himself and hand-deliver it.  “It’s disgusting he does not know how to get hold of her. “What would happen if \u0026shysomething happened to him?” Thomas’ fears over never seeing any children Meghan may have were also reported in the interview. He has made no secret of his hopes that she starts her own family. He already has three grandchildren from his two eldest children. A friend in Rosarito, Mexico, where Thomas lives, said: “Tom loves children. He dotes on them. “He knows Meghan has always wanted children, but it breaks his heart to think he will not get to see any \u0026shygrandchild she has with Harry. He keeps asking himself over and over why? The only thing he can think of is the shots he’s taken at the royal family. “Tom did so out of frustration, nothing more. “It was like no one was listening to him while his ex-wife Doria was being played out in the media as though she could do no wrong. He has some bitterness about that. What people don’t realise is how much of a role Tom played in Meg’s life.”  It had been reported Thomas felt it would be better for all had he not survived his heart operation. But Samantha insisted: “My father never said that he thought he would be better off dead. He’s very upset.” But a source said: “Tom feels it would be easier for Meghan if he were out of the picture completely. “He has told people there is a part of him that thinks it would be easier if his heart packed up all together and he was no longer around. He thinks if he did die there would be an outpouring of sympathy for Meg.” Thomas said he believes Princess Diana would have loathed the way he had been treated. He said in the interview: “They [the royals] have Meghan treating her father in a way that Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, would have loathed. That’s not what Diana stood for.” Samantha added: “I believe he’s right about what he said about Diana though because Diana was a loving humanitarian, she was very \u0026shydiplomatic and she treated her family with a lot of respect.  “But I don’t think Meghan should need someone like Diana to tell her how to treat her father. She’s almost 37, not 12, so she knows the right way to treat people. “The thing both my dad and I are sick of is our family being publicly mocked and flogged. “The challenges that we’ve had have been blown way out of proportion.” Dad-of-three Thomas and Doria, his second wife, divorced in 1987 when Meghan was six. For the next five years, she lived with her mum then moved back with her dad in Los Angeles. Meghan left for college at 17 and never returned as she pursued her acting career. But she and Thomas remained close, none more so than when his mum Doris was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. Meghan’s half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr, 51, said: “For two years, every other weekend Meghan visited gran without fail. “She would read to her, show her pictures, watch TV with her. She did anything to make life appear as normal as possible. As she grew worse gran would often forget who my dad or I was, we’d go every weekend.  “But when Meg walked in an instant smile crossed gran’s face and she knew she’d be OK. Meghan has this ability to bring comfort to those she meets, and I truly think its something similar to what Princess Diana had. She was then still very close to dad.” But after Doris died, Meghan landed a part in the US legal drama, Suits, filmed in Toronto. She and Thomas spoke less and less and he moved to Rosarito after being made \u0026shybankrupt. Since news of his daughter’s \u0026shyrelationship with Harry emerged in 2016, friends said at best contact between them has been “intermittent”. Thomas has never met the prince and has only spoken to him on the phone. But he said in his interview he wouldn’t care if Harry, 33, never spoke to him again. He added: “I’ll survive”. A week before the royal wedding on May 19 at Windsor Castle it was still not known if Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle.

The search for the Malaysia Airlines plane was officially suspended by Australian officials on January 17, 2017 but 10 months later in October the Malaysian government confirmed it hoped to strike a deal with US companies to continue the hunt. Now officials have released the final report into what happened, not long after the four-year anniversary since the Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8 2014, sparking a wide-reaching search focused on the Indian Ocean. The plane was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing with 239 passengers and crew on board. Three pieces of wreckage believed to be from MH370 were found in Tanzania and South Africa. The final report concludes that the team were unable to find the real cause behind the missing plane. With the search now over and the craft not found there\u0027s fresh heartache for families. The reason why the plane crashed and disappeared looks like it will forever remain a mystery and something which conspiracy theorists will continue to speculate on. Investigators said they looked at more than 60 theories - here we look at some of the bizarre conspiracies over the missing plane.  Plane was shot down during military ops A shocking book claims that missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up . ‘Flight MH370: The Mystery ’ makes the incredible allegation that the airline was shot down by US-Thai strike fighters as part of a training drill that went horribly wrong. But just 71 days after the Boeing 777 vanished carrying 239 people from 14 nations relatives say the UK published work is ‘too soon’ and ‘too insensitive’. The book says the drill was to involve mock warfare on land, in water and in the air, and would include live-fire exercises. It adds: “Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370. Such things do happen. No one wants another Lockerbie, so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it.”  Rapper predicted loss of plane Rapper Pitbull predicted that Flight MH370 would go missing YEARS ago, it has been suggested. Conspiracy theorists have been drawing comparisons between the lyrics of his 2012 track Get It Started and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the plane on March 8. Lines in the song, which features a guest appearance from Colombian singer Shakira, include: Now it\u0027s off to Malaysia and Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day.  Viewers on YouTube are convinced the two passports is a reference to the stolen Austrian and Italian passports used by two Iranians to board MH370. They also believe the three cities refer to the capital cities of Malaysia, China and Vietnam and the two countries are Malaysia and Vietnam.  Ex-PM joins conspiracy theorists Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused the CIA of known the whereabouts of flight MH370 . He said in a blog that someone was hide something because if the plane\u0027s GPS system failed then Boeing or the US government agency would know why. In his blog in 2015, the 88-year-old suggests that in the event of the jet being hijacked, then control of the aircraft could have been remotely activated elsewhere. He said: Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH370 B777 is one. He added: Someone is hiding something. It is not fair that MAS and Malaysia should take the blame.  US military base conspiracy The United States have been forced to flatly deny claims that the plane landed at its military base on the remote island of Diego Garcia.  There were strong rumours that the jetliner could have headed for the small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean, which sits around 3,500km from Malaysia. However, a spokesman for the US embassy in the Malaysian capital said there was no truth in this speculation. He told Malaysia\u0027s Star newspaper by email: There was no indication that MH370 flew anywhere near the Maldives or Diego Garcia. MH370 did not land in Diego Garcia. Afghan hijacking  A Russian newspaper claimed MH370 has been hijacked and flown to Afghanistan, where the crew and passengers were being held captive. A military source reportedly told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper: Flight MH370 Malaysia Airlines missing on March 8 with 239 passengers was hijacked. Pilots are not guilty the plane was hijacked by unknown terrorists. We know that the name of the terrorist who gave instructions to pilots is Hitch. The plane is in Afghanistan not far from Kandahar near the border with Pakistan. Others have since gone on to indicate that the passengers have been divided into seven groups and are living in mud huts with almost no food. MH370 \u0027hid\u0027 behind another plane Early in the search it was suggested that the plane may have hidden from detection under another plane. Blogger Keith Ledgerwood suggested: It is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of [Singapore Airlines flight] 68 through India and Afghanistan airspace. As MH370 was flying \u0027dar\u0027 without a transponder, SIA 68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around as it entered Indian airspace, it would have shown up as one single blip on the radar with only the transponder information of SIA68 lighting up ATC and military radar screens. This theory was described as feasible but the planes would have to be within 3,300ft of each other. Alien abduction Social media users jumped on the possibility of extraterrestrial life having something to do with the missing plane. One user wrote: After an extensive conversation with my father \u0026amp his partner, we have come to the conclusion that the only explanation is #aliens mh370. Another added: I secretly believe that plane is abducted by aliens.. I know I’m not the only one.. And one user even said there were only two possibilities for its disappearance, aliens or a DB Cooper-style heist. He wrote: This Malaysian airlines flight has the potential to be either the greatest heist since DB Cooper, or alien abduction. I vote aliens.       A life insurance scam The Malaysian police chief refused to rule out the possibility of the missing plane being an elaborate insurance scam. Khalid Abu Bakar addressed the world in 2015 to provide an update on the investigation and revealed authorities were exploring every single avenue - no matter how remote. Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money, you know, we are looking at all possibilities, he said. The authorities\u0027 investigations extend to examining every detail of the passengers for any clues as to what may have happened. We are looking very closely at the video footage taken at the KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers, he added. The Illuminati Reddit users have taken a keen interest in the disappearance. One, known only as i-am-SHER-locked apparently uncovered that the Boeing 777 in question was the 404th such aircraft to be produced. An HTTP 404 error means not found, they wrote. Which in this case is oddly appropriate for the status of the aircraft, or just a coincidence. Coincidence, I think not. Edward Snowden  There were early suggestions 20 employees from the Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor were on board the flight. So Reddit user Dark_Spectre has put two and two together and come up with, well, you decide. So we have the American IBM Technical Storage Executive for Malaysia, a man working in mass storage aggregation for the company implicated by the Snowden papers for providing their services to assist the National Security Agency in surveilling the Chinese, he wrote. And now this bunch of US chip guys working for a global leader in embedded processing solutions (embedded smart phone tech and defense contracting) all together..on a plane..And disappeared.. Coincidence?? He goes on to say that the plane itself was kidnapped by Chinese authorities to uncover more about Snowden\u0027s revelations. Electronic warfare experiment A theory suggesting the plane was hidden as part of an experiment has circulated. Citizens news site Beforeitsnews reported: It is conceivable that the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 plane is \u0027cloaked\u0027, hiding with hi-tech electronic warfare weaponry that exists and is used. In fact, this type of technology is precisely the expertise of Freescale, that has 20 employees on board the missing flight. It also sparked theories the plane could have been taken by North Korea for similarly unknown purposes. A reddit user wrote: “There’s no telling what crazy logic they [North Korea] might have for taking a plane. They literally have no grasp of reality and have been caught red handed kidnapping foreigners, making s**t up and generally being d****es.”  Fire on board  One of the most widely held theories is that there was a fire on board that killed all on board but burned out before damaging the exterior of the plane. This would explain why the aircraft, on auto-pilot, would fly such a long distance off course. An aviation source said that if this was the case, it would have hit the water at around 600mph after gliding down from 35,000ft. The source said: “The plane would not have dropped like a stone, it would have glided down from 35,000ft for around 10-12 minutes after it had exhausted its fuel. “It would have hit the water with a massive impact - as though the plane had landed on concrete. Nobody could have survived that. “There would have been a huge explosion with the wings ripped off and the fuselage would probably have plummeted straight down.” A military take out or secret weapon at work Conspiracy theory and scientific site Natural News, run by Mike Adams, has another theory. Adams said: “If we never find the debris, it means some entirely new, mysterious and powerful force is at work on our planet, which can pluck airplanes out of the sky without leaving behind even a shred of evidence. He added: “If there does exist a weapon with such capabilities, whoever controls it already has the ability to dominate all of Earth\u0027s nations with a fearsome military weapon of unimaginable power. He believes the plane fell into an area outside the search zone and could lead to a very dark end for Earth.  Pilot suicide One explanation for the sudden disappearance, according to some, could be pilot suicide. But so far no evidence has come to light to suggest either captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid had such intentions. John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), told the Daily Mail, when asked if it was a possibility: I think you cannot discount any theory. Malaysian police have attempted to investigate whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said at a news conference: We are looking at all possibilities. Other theorists have claimed the pilot or crew could have hijacked the plane themselves. But Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, said the captain in charge of the flight was a very seasoned pilot with an excellent record. There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude, Dunleavy told Reuters in an interview. We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft. Cracks in the aircraft Six months before the plane went down, the U.S. aviation watchdog warned airlines of a problem with cracks in Boeing 777s that could lead to a mid-air break up or a catastrophic drop in pressure. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert in September last year giving airlines until April 9 to detect and correct cracking in the fuselage skin on Boeing 777s. The FAA warned that failure to do so would leave the aircraft vulnerable to ‘a rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity’. The organisation issued a final directive just two days before the Malaysia Airlines plane took off and said one airline had found a 16-in crack in the fuselage skin of a 14-year-old plane. However, Boeing said that the FAA alert did not apply to the missing jet because it did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s. It\u0027s in an Asian Bermuda triangle     The idea there could be a second Bermuda Triangle seems a popular one on social media. Its sudden and unexplained disappearance from radar could have several explanations, whether it be a sudden explosion or mid-air disintegration, or even a mechanical failure. But some theorists believe it simply means the plane has entered another Devil\u0027s Triangle. Boats and planes have been known to disappear in the patch of sea in the North Atlantic Ocean, known as the Bermuda Triangle, including Flight 19 in 1945, when five torpedo bombers mysteriously vanished. But could there really be another one? One Twitter user wrote: So...what is up with this Malaysian airplane thing? Is there an Asian version of the Bermuda Triangle? Another added: Maybe there\u0027s such thing as Asian bermuda triangle. #Malaysia #MalaysiaAirlines. Terrorists crashed it into the sea No terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the missing flight, but that hasn\u0027t stopped theorists claiming it\u0027s the only explanation. The two passengers who boarded the plane with stolen passports really triggered this possibility, with many believing they must be part of a huge cover up to sink the plane. Pilot David Learmount, who is operations and safety editor of Flight Global magazine, said: “Something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone. Why? It’s a good question. “It’s extraordinary the pilots failed to call because they had plenty of time to. Unless there was a bomb on board but there has been no evidence of that.” Other groups, however, have claimed responsibility over the last few days, including an unknown Chinese group. An email was sent to various journalists in China, saying: “You kill one of our clan, we will kill 100 of you as payback.” But officials in Malaysia have said they believe the group\u0027s claim could be a hoax. The email did not explain what had happened to the plane. Pilot \u0027deliberately turned off passengers\u0027 oxygen supply\u0027 before ditching into sea  Passengers on flight MH370 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the Indian Ocean, according to a study into the disaster. Analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared beneath the waves. The most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately de-pressurised the cabin, thereby depriving those on board of air, the research concludes. Although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats, their supply was limited to just 20 minutes. Those unable to grab a mask, including sleeping passengers, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes. Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a prime suspect because he cleared his diary  The captain of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was a prime suspect in the jet’s disappearance – because he had made no future plans. Back in 2015, detectives from Malaysia’s special branch found Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, had cleared his diary of social or work commitments, unlike his crew. The inquiry made him the most likely culprit if the plane was lost due to human intervention. The final report does emphasise that he was a very competent pilot with an almost flawless safety record.  We cannot establish if the aircraft was flown by anyone other than the pilot, but we cannot exclude the possibility of unlawful interference by a third party, it added.  There was also no psychological evidence to suggest any of the crew deliberately crashed the plane.

The 450-page document found the flight deliberately turned round at some point after takeoff - and investigators cannot rule out the possibility of hijacking. The jet vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014 with 239 people on board - mostly Chinese and Malaysian nationals - while en-route from Kuala Lumpar to Beijing. The Malaysian government has faced accusations of holding back information - but hopes the final report into the tragedy will draw a line under it. Kok Soo Chon, the lead investigator, told a press conference...  The aircraft, instead of going straight to Beijing, made a right turn then a left turn and went in a south-westerly direction. Communications equipment was also turned off. The turn-back was not because of anomalies in the mechanical systems... we can confirm the turn-back... was made under manual control. He said: We cannot establish if the aircraft was flown by anyone other than the pilot, but we cannot exclude the possibility of unlawful interference by a third party. But there is no evidence to support the theory the plane was taken over remotely by hackers. The captain was a very competent pilot with an almost flawless safety record and there were no known defects with the plane. The co-pilot\u0027s flight simulator was seized from his home but investigators concluded there was nothing suspicious on it. There was no psychological or criminal evidence to suggest any of the crew deliberately crashed the plane. Despite the full wreckage never being found, damage examination indicates the plane was not configured to land, suggesting no-one was in control of the jet during its final moments. Three pieces of wreckage believed to be from MH370 have been found from as far north as Tanzania and as far south as South Africa. There was a 221kg shipment of lithium ion batteries on board that had not been scanned because there were no X-ray machines big enough, as well as 4.5 tons of mangosteen fruit. The report ends: In conclusion, the team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370.  Investigators say they considered more than 60 theories about what could have happened to the plane.  Grieving families who had advanced sight of the report before its official release this morning said it provided no new answers, according to Reuters news agency.  It did, however, highlight mistakes and protocols and guidelines that were not followed, the families told reporters after a briefing on the report. The report said: The air traffic controllers did not initiate, in a timely manner, the three standard emergency phases in accordance with the standard operating procedures. The command of the English language between Kuala Lumpar and Ho Chi Minh airports needs improvement, the document added. The report concluded communication systems were most likely turned off manually whether with intent or otherwise - and it is impossible to know whether the aircraft broke up in the air or after plunging into the sea.  We hope that these mistakes will not be repeated and that measures are put in place to prevent them in the future, said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane.

The report comes two months after Malaysia called off a privately funded underwater search for the aircraft. The MH370 riddle is one of the most perplexing incidents the aviation world has ever seen, but extensive searches have proved fruitless. Today\u0027s report comes two months after Malaysia called off a privately funded underwater search for the aircraft.  The only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777 aircraft have been three wing fragments washed up on Indian Ocean coasts. It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a $200million hunt across an area of 120,000 square kilometres last year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed says he would consider resuming the search if new clues came to light. The plane left Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time. The final voice communication from the cockpit came less than an hour after takeoff: Good night, Malaysian three seven zero.  But the plane stopped communicating with ground control, deviating from its planned route two hours after take off, according to data from military radar. It abruptly left its planned route and turned back towards Malaysia, but dropped off the ground off course somewhere around the Indian Ocean. Bizarrely, there were no reports of bad weather or distress calls. Aircraft communications had purposely been disabled earlier in the flight and although a signal was received, it did not contain information about where it was. Around 12 hours after contact was lost, teams from Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia began searching in the waters near Vietnam, but they had no real idea where to start.  FBI and Interpol flew in to help and 40 ships worked around the clock, with 34 aircrafts flying during daylight hours. The first fragment of the plane - a piece of wing - was found in July 2015 on Reunion Island, thousands of miles from Kuala Lumpur. The search resumed in October 2015 but the investigation was constantly hampered by bad weather. In four years of searching, the only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777 aircraft have been three wing fragments washed up on Indian Ocean coasts: in Madagascar, R\u0026eacuteunion Island , and Tanzania.

The Malaysia Airlines jet was carrying 239 people when it disappeared off the radar in March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpar to Beijing. The full wreckage was never found but is believed to be somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Three pieces of wreckage believed to be from MH370 have been found from as far north as Tanzania and as far south as South Africa. Crash investigators today revealed they considered more than 60 theories about what could have happened to the plane as they published their final report into the disaster .  What happened to MH370? The Boeing 777 plane carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members took off from Kuala Lumpar International Airport at 12.42am local time, destined for the Chinese capital five and a half hours later. It received final clearance to reach its altitude from Malaysian air traffic control at 1.19am and the pilots were told to make radio contact with Vietnamese officials. At this time, MH370 gave its chilling final radio transmission from the cockpit as it said goodbye to Malaysian air traffic controllers: Goodnight, Malaysian Three Seven Zero. It dropped off radar around a minute later while flying over the Gulf of Thailand.  Plane disappeared off radar and turned off communications According to lead investigator Kok Soo Chon, the aircraft, instead of going straight to Beijing, made a right turn then a left turn and went in a south-westerly direction. Communications equipment was also turned off. The turn-back was not because of anomalies in the mechanical systems... we can confirm the turn-back... was made under manual control, he said. No-one knows why the change of direction was made but the actions of a terrorist cannot be ruled out.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

In some ways it felt like it was taking forever for us to get there. But she is a bit better now so we are really excited and hopeful.“She is still in a bit of pain but hopefully that is OK while we are in Germany.

It’s just been incredible how everyone rallied together to raise this amount of money so quickly.”The therapy at the clinic in the Black Forest offers immunotherapy, a new treatment that is said to have cured some cancer patients.

We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes. Paul is more of a winger and we cannot give him high balls and expect him to win headers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"van driver was more than twice speed limit near dundee

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland

fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

community","story":"\u0026nbspTHE length of time being taken to start work on the fire-ravaged former Eastgate Hostel in Inverness city centre is \"unacceptable\", a senior Highland Council official has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Monday 30 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116840.jpg","title":"New team aims to make changes easier","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW team of health and social care professionals has been established to support disabled people transition from children to adult services.People aged between 14 and 25 were traditionally supported by Highland Council\u0027s children\u0027s services and NHS Highland\u0027s adult services.The new transitioning team will provide a consistent platform for young people, parents and carers at what can be a challenging time.Nicola Stewart, transitions team manager, said: \"The team has been set up in response to recognising that the transition period can be difficult for young people and their families and carers.\"There are a lot of changes in a young person\u0027s life during that period, such as leaving full-time education and starting employment, and we don\u0027t want the process of transitioning from one service to another to exacerbate that.\"The overarching vision for the team is to take young people living in the Inner Moray Firth area through the process of transition and to support them in a more consistent way than has been possible in the past.\"Transitions team manager Stella Chisholm said: \"The establishment of the team will provide the opportunity for the one service to support an individual from 14 years of age all the way through to 25.\"This is a fantastic example of joint working.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping. The photograph was taken at sunset with flash.’For his efforts, Alan won a bottle of Oban whisky, a box of 24 chocolates from the Oban Chocolate Company and a Cashmere scarf from Islay Woolen Mill.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute cup all set for action","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 2:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSaturday August 4 will see the return of the Argyll and Bute Cup tournament, hosted by Lochgilphead Red Star.The competition will feature Group A  at the Lochgilphead joint campus 3G astro, comprising Oban Saints, Lochgilphead Red Star, Neilston and Port Glasgow Athletic.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talented mojo line up announced","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 28/07/18, 5:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter having had a meeting recently to choose all the acts, the MOJO crew would like to say thanks for all interest shown.They didn’t have it easy deciding the final line-up as the response resulted in a very large and varied selection to choose from.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire motorists urged park appropriately","story":"NewsAyrshire motorists urged to park appropriately at Ayr and Crosshouse HospitalsDrivers warned to keep grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staffShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:00, 29 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth bosses were this week urging motorists to park ‘appropriately’ after complaints about parking chaos at Ayr Hospital. NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

Ayr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event to raise awareness and money for UNICEF. Pupils had a kicking time as they took part in football challenges ranging from beat the goalie to foot bowl – football’s equivalent of 10 pin bowling.  And, of course, the youngsters enjoyed being pictured with Ayr’s own sporty star Michael, who brought along the League 1 trophy. The event was a huge success, raising \u0026pound338 for UNICEF and helping raise awareness for young people in need throughout the UK and beyond.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

the venue and an almost capacity crowd, last Tuesday night, remained enthralled throughout the show.It featured traditional circus acts including juggling, acrobatics and clown duo Sarita and Kim León, as well as more modern performances featuring lasers and pyrotechnics.While some younger children weren\u0026#8217t too keen on the clowns, who interacted with the audience throughout much of the performance, others found them the most amusing, their slapstick capers eliciting some of the biggest laughs.The most heart-stopping moments came from aerial artiste, Alexandra, whose skills on an elevated hoop were astounding, and one of the Jackson Family, who balanced precariously atop a ladder.Other tense moments came from an entertainer who spun various items at the same time with her hands and feet, including a pole that was on fire at either end, the audience waiting to see if it would plummet into the stands.Even the more basic stunts, like juggling, had an added element of tension, with the objects, resembling yo-yos, launched many feet into the air by a rope.The animal-free circus continued its UK tour, leaving Campbeltown on Thursday morning heading for Arran, before bringing the magic to Annan in Dumfries and Galloway and arriving in Appleby today (Friday).Alexandra impressed the crowd with her aerial acrobatics. 50_c30montinicircus02The room was on tenterhooks

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A spokesman said some suffered light injuries and were traumatised, but most were in good condition.  The earthquake early on Sunday killed 16 people, including an Indonesian student who was among the Mount Rinjani climbers.  The shallow quake set off landslides on the rocky mountainside, blocking the normal pathways out.  The National Disaster Mitigation Agency had said more than 680 people were stranded on Rinjani, an active volcano, based on figures from its entry gates where visitors are registered. Most are foreign \u0026ndash from 26 countries \u0026ndash including more than 330 from Thailand.  Rescuers are escorting trekkers down the mountain, and Indonesia\u0026rsquos elite special forces have also been deployed to speed up the evacuation.  The shallow quake damaged more than 1,400 houses and was felt on neighbouring Bali island, where no damage or casualties were reported.

Health workers in the public sector showed the highest rate of absence due to illness, logging a sickness absence rate of 3.3%.  \u0026ldquoIt is possible that the exposure of health workers to infections and diseases contributes to their higher sickness absence rate.

Introduced by Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP Government, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act (OBFA) was passed in response to trouble at an Old Firm match and after parcel bombs were sent to former Celtic manager Neil Lennon and others.  However, the law was derided by legal experts, football supporters and opposition politicians who believed it singled out fans for special treatment.  Kelly, a Glasgow MSP, secured cross-party support this year to repeal a law that was described by one sheriff as \u0026ldquomince.  Although the Act has been scrapped, prosecutors have rebadged the outstanding charges as breaches of different legislation, a move critics believe is symptomatic of wider problems with the way football fans are dealt with by the criminal justice system.  During a recent pre-season friendly between Celtic and Standard Liege at Parkhead, a police officer pointed a video camera at a group of fans. After the incident was flagged up by Fans Against Criminalisation \u0026ndash a group which was set up to oppose the OBFA \u0026ndash the official Police Scotland Twitter account responded: \"Officers were deployed as a result of pro IRA songs being sung by a section of the crowd.\"  The force added: \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot want police filming supporters at the game, don\u0026rsquot commit a crime. Both tweets were posted in the name of Superintendent John McBride.  Kelly said: \u0026ldquoDespite the repeal of the Act four months ago, the policing strategy at games can feel over the top and I have heard from numerous fans that it is ruining their match days. Only the other weekend we saw a cop pointing a video camera at a stand filming individual fans just watching the football, and then the official Police Scotland account sending passive aggressive tweets telling fans not to commit crime.  \u0026ldquoAt any other event you would expect to be treated with dignity by the police. That is sadly not the case in Scotland. Football fans are second-class citizens to the SNP Government, and that is why Labour is calling for an independent review of the way football policing is carried out.  FAC asked the Police Scotland for clarification of the tweets, after which McBride emailed the group about the controversy: \u0026ldquoI was the match commander of that fixture and prior to the game information had been received that \u0027Ultra\u0027 fans from Belgium would be attending the fixture. Being unaware of the threat these fans posed, I instructed officers with cameras be included in the match day operation.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt no time in my response on Twitter did I indicate that I felt that anyone connected with Fans Against Criminalisation were (or indeed are) in any way responsible for any of the actions that led to the police filming fans at that fixture and I would hope that you accept this communication as confirmation of that.  Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: \"The policing of football matches is under constant review and while there is a general framework of how we approach them, the tactics and deployments will vary dependent on circumstances such as the nature of the match and the risk associated with it. As in the past, I or my colleagues will happily meet with any supporters\u0027 groups to discuss any concerns they may have.\""},{"url":null,"title":"michael-gove-summons-company-chiefs-to-water-leak-summit","story":"  Mr Gove said customers expect a \"reliable and resilient water supply\" amid low levels in some reservoirs and the introduction by North West supplier United Utilities of a hosepipe ban from August 5.  It comes as farmers were also due to meet with Government officials for a \"drought summit\" to discuss the effect on the country\u0027s food supplies of the extensive heatwave that has scorched the UK.  The first half of the summer in the UK has been the driest since 1961 with Thursday and Friday\u0027s wet weather and storms the first rainfall in weeks.  Mr Gove said that firms \"have much more to do to tackle leakage\", adding: \"That is why I have repeatedly made clear that companies must improve and recently wrote to them to outline my expectations during this period of dry weather.  \"Next week I will ask the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to a meeting at Defra to discuss how they are going to address this serious issue and improve their performance.\"  United Utilities has previously been accused of \"wasting\" 430 million litres of water every day from leakages.  The GMB union said earlier this month that its research showed that United Utilities was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u0027 worth of water to go \"down the plughole\" every day.  The company said at the time that \"reducing leaks is a top priority\".  Irrigation water shortages, a lack of fresh forage for animals and growing conditions for cereal crops are among issues that will be discussed at separate talks chaired by National Farmers\u0027 Union president Minette Batters.  She will sit down on Wednesday with officials from Defra and a wide array of rural agencies, plus figures from farming charities after a July that has seen England receive just 15% of its long-term average rainfall.  Ms Batters described the situation as \"hugely challenging\" for all sectors of farming, warning that the thunderstorms and showers some areas are receiving \"won\u0027t mitigate the many issues farmers are experiencing\".  She said: \"There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests.\"  Those due to attend the summit alongside Defra include the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and farming charities RABI and Farming Community Network, the NFU said.  Last week the Environment Agency said it had responded to 44 \"significant\" environmental incidents since the end of June, including moorland fires, algal blooms, dry boreholes, low river flows and fish rescues as the hot, dry weather continues to grip.  The last month of dry, hot weather followed the driest June since 1925, the Environment Agency said. It has seen the water level in many reservoirs fall dramatically.  While only one water company is currently planning a hosepipe ban, continued dry weather into the autumn could see a risk of further restrictions and impacts on the environment, the National Drought Group said.  Ms Batters added: \"This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all.

Britain leaving the EU is the perfect time to come up with new ways of controlling national borders, the paper published on Monday by Policy Exchange suggests.  The idea of a national ID system for British citizens has been controversial for some time, with many people opposing it on civil liberties grounds.  A \u0026pound5 billion national identity card scheme was introduced by the last Labour government in 2006 but a Bill to scrap it was the first legislation introduced by Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010.  EU citizens already in the UK will have to pay \u0026pound65 and join a registration scheme if they wish to stay in Britain after the end of the transition period on December 31 2020 under changes announced by the current Home Secretary Sajid Javid.  In the report, David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integration, suggests that the scheme should be widened to Britons, initially on a voluntary basis.  He said: \"We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.  \"A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.\"  Among the other ideas in The Border Audit: A Post-Windrush Review, are:  - A more decisive removals process, that gets people out before they can judicially review their cases, plus reforms to allow applications for asylum from outside the UK and private sponsorship of them.  - An amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more  - More cash to pay illegal immigrants to leave and a joint scheme involving the Department for International Development to help them set up businesses in their countries of origin  - A British version of the US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) that allows non-UK citizens to use e-gates at borders and made it quicker for \"low-risk groups\" to enter  - One single \"command\" responsible for sea borders, under one person based in Portsmouth  - Make rail and ferry operators provide more information about passengers and introduce more collaboration with Irish authorities to close down the Common Travel Area \"backdoor\"  - Reduce citizenship application fees from \u0026pound1,500 per person and almost \u0026pound5,000 for a family with two children to a level \"more closely aligned to public policy, not just revenue needs\"  - Higher overall investment, including better detection systems for lorries at Calais and Dover, more staff and more border patrol boats  Mr Goodhart added: \"Illegal immigration is not only unfair on legal immigrants who wait their turn in the queue and the employers and businesses who play (and pay) by the rules, it also fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes.  \"While a general amnesty for the estimated 500,000 illegal residents here would send the wrong signal, some form of regularisation should also be considered for those who have been here for more than 10 years, who are now parts of their communities with ties to the UK and often become the focus of grassroots campaigns.\"  A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform at the border as well as investing in new capability to improve passenger experience.  \"Examples of this include e-Passport gates and motion detection technology which benefit passengers and improve security.  \"Border Force invested \u0026pound63.5 million in new technology and capability in 2017-18 and \u0026pound90.4 million in the two previous years combined.  \"Decisions on the future immigration system will be based on evidence.  \"This is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the economic and social impacts of the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and also on how the UK\u0027s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"close-call-predicted-but-interest-rates-expected-to-rise","story":"  In what would mark another milestone for the economy in its recovery since the financial crisis, members of nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are expected to increase rates from 0.5% to 0.75% on Thursday.  The move would see rates hit their highest level since March 2009, when they were slashed from 1% to 0.5% as the financial meltdown and recession wrought havoc.  Investec economist George Brown said he is \"fairly confident\" the Bank will move to raise rates and is pencilling in an 8-1 vote in favour, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only dissenter.  He believes the economy has performed in line with the Bank\u0027s last forecasts in May, when it backed off from a widely anticipated hike and said it wanted to wait and see how the economy recovered after a weather-hit start to the year.  The bank also edged a step closer to pressing the button in June when its chief economist Andy Haldane joined two fellow policymakers in calling for a rise.  Howard Young at the EY Item Club believes the vote may be less definitive, given that inflation figures recently came in lower than expected - unchanged at 2.4% in June, while wage growth has also been weak.  He said: \"It has recently become a closer call, but we believe that the odds still favour the Bank of England lifting interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75% on Thursday after the August MPC meeting - most likely following a split vote.\"  He added: \"With interest rates down at 0.50%, the Bank of England would clearly likely to gradually normalise monetary policy given that it is essentially an emergency low rate.  \"Furthermore, inflation remains above target and the labour market looks relatively tight with the MPC considering that there is little slack left in the economy.\"  The decision to raise rates would come as a blow to some borrowers on variable rate mortgages, but would offer relief to savers who have seen paltry returns on deposits since rates have languished at 0.5% or below since 2009.  It is thought the bank\u0027s latest set of forecasts in the accompanying inflation report will reinforce the case for a rise, with many economists expecting growth to have recovered to 0.4% in the second quarter after slowing to 0.2% in the previous three months.  The bank had already predicted in May that this would be the case and its latest set of forecasts are set to confirm its outlook for the year ahead.  But the bank is likely to increase its inflation forecasts, with a weaker pound and higher oil and energy prices pushing up the outlook and further justifying the need for a rise.  A rate rise in August would be the second hike in the past year, after the Bank voted for an increase from 0.25% to 0.5% in November - the first such move for more than 10 years and reversing the cut made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  Mr Brown believes this will be the only increase in 2018, however, predicting a quarter point rise every six months until they reach 1.5% in 2020.  \"We think the bank wants to raise rates in a gradual way and that would be consistent with the next one in February,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"britains-longest-running-childrens-comic-the-beano-celebrates-its-80th-birthday","story":"  And although Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx still look as youthful as ever as you flick through the pages, the comic is celebrating its 80th birthday.

Most of the Beano\u0026rsquos best-known characters were introduced to the pages of the Beano in the years after its launch, with the first edition fronted by Big Eggo The Ostrich who kept his place there for a decade before being ousted by Biffo the Bear.  Very few first issues of the Beano remain in existence, with one selling for more than \u0026pound17,000 at auction in 2015. Dennis the Menace is the longest-running character to appear in the comic. He made his Beano debut on March 17, 1951, but the \u0026ldquoWorld\u0026rsquos Wildest Boy had to wait until May 5 of that year to be given his trademark black-and-red stripped jumper.  Beano has also diversified to target a new online audience, launching Beano in 2016, which has been visited by 2.5million children. Meanwhile, 1.86 million copies of Beano were sold in 2017, with latest figures showing a 7.9% year-on-year increase in sales, recording weekly sales figures of 37,542 copies.  To further mark the special birthday, Beano have relaunched the infamous Fan Club, offering free membership and printable club badges and certificates.  Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said: \u0026ldquoEverything about Beano has always evolved naturally, inspired by the kids we speak and listen to, every single day.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove ensured the situations our characters find themselves in are always relatable to every generation. It\u0026rsquos all underpinned by our philosophy of laughing at the world via a kid\u0026rsquos-eye view.  \u0026ldquoOur online hub, Beano - the fastest growing kids\u0026rsquo website in the UK - and No 1 smash-hit Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed animation series now mean more kids than ever before are enjoying Beano-inspired everyday rebellion."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-faces-green-transport-revolution-as-uk-ministers-consider-electric-delivery-vehicles-for-cities","story":"  Britain is facing a green \u0026ldquotransport revolution with the government determined to find ways of reducing congestion and cutting pollution.  With the UK having more than four million vans and lorries on its roads, whose numbers are set to increase with more online sales, it has been suggested they are replaced with a range of electronic transport, including vans, cargo bikes, quadricycles and micro vehicles, to transform the last-mile deliveries across congested cities.  The idea forms part of Whitehall\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoLast Mile and Future of Mobility document, published today, calling for ways to tackle the problem of traffic in city centres.  UK ministers say the documents offer a glimpse into how technology could transform the country\u0026rsquos transport system, making it safer, more accessible and greener than ever.  The Department for Transport suggested travel around the UK could dramatically change with the \u0026ldquointroduction of flying vehicles or widespread use of self-driving cars, all while travel data would help to deliver better journeys.  It noted that the potential increased use of self-driving vehicles and shared travel could also transform how city centres look in years to come. For example, the majority of parking spaces could be removed, opening areas up for redevelopment and potentially hundreds of thousands of new urban homes.  The Government documents fire the starting gun on its Future of Mobility Grand Challenge, which aims to make the UK the world leader in the movement of goods, services and people.  The work is all part of the Conservative administration\u0026rsquos Industrial Strategy and, said the Department, it could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make travel safer, improve accessibility, and present enormous economic opportunities for the UK.  As part of this, the Government today also confirmed more than \u0026pound12m for six projects working on simulation and modelling to aid the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. The capability, it explained, would be essential for developing, testing and proving the safety of the vehicles.  Jesse Norman, the Transport Minister, said: \u0026ldquoThe UK has a long and proud history of leading the world in transport innovation and our Future of Mobility Grand Challenge is designed to ensure this continues.  \u0026ldquoWe are on the cusp of an exciting and profound change in how people, goods and services move around the country which is set to be driven by extraordinary innovation.  \u0026ldquoThis could bring significant benefits to people right across the country and presents enormous economic opportunities for the UK, with autonomous vehicles sales set to be worth up to \u0026pound52 billion by 2035.  \u0026ldquoThis call for evidence marks just one stage in our push to make the most of these inviting opportunities, he added.  Today\u0026rsquos publication precedes a full Future of Urban Mobility Strategy, which is due to be published by the end of the year.  It coincides with the announced of the appointment of Ian Robertson, the Chief Executive of BMW UK, as Business Champion to help advise, shape and develop the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge.  He said: \u0026ldquoA transport revolution in the way people and goods move around will see more changes in the next ten years than the previous hundred.  \u0026ldquoAs the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge Business Champion, I\u0026rsquom looking forward to working with the Government to help the UK build on its existing strengths and capitalise on that opportunity.  The Department pointed out how changes in society had already changed the way people were travelling such as people driving less overall, fewer workers commuting, a growing elderly population and the number of people living in urban areas increasing.  As a result, the Government has used its call for evidence to outline trends which could shape the future of transport in the UK. These include:  *Cleaner transport. The Government has already outlined its intention for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040. Falling battery prices, improvements in electric vehicle technology and the development of alternative fuels are not only reducing emissions from existing modes of transport but paving the way for the uptake of new creations.  *Automation. Improved sensors, increased computing power and the exciting potential of artificial intelligence are leading to increased automation in transport. The Government has already said it expected to see fully self-driving cars on UK roads by 2021 and the benefits of automated transport could include increased safety, improved accessibility and better use of urban space.  *Data and connectivity. Internet-connected vehicles can not only link with each other, helping to avert congestion on roads but also traffic lights and motorway signs. This could not only reduce traffic but also improve air quality.  *New modes. UK cities are already pioneering the use of drones to support emergency services and improve infrastructure inspections. But the introduction of aerial passenger vehicles could also appear in urban areas, while the lines between taxis and buses could blur, with more on demand transport.  *Shared mobility. More use of shared transport could reduce congestion and emissions and examples are likely to include commercial ride sharing, car rental services where users rent from one another and shared use bikes.  *Changing consumer attitudes. Technology is also changing the way people expect to be able to travel with more users expecting to be able to plan, book and pay for transport through their phones.  *New business models. New business models are beginning to emerge, such as Mobility as a Service. Maas can make payment easier, provide better real-time information and allow passengers to book multiple modes of transport with just one click."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-told-by-italys-matteo-salvini-to-be-tough-with-brussels-or-face-being-swindled","story":"  Right-wing populist Matteo Salvini insisted the Prime Minister should be prepared to walk away without a deal, saying: \"On some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards.\"  Mr Salvini, a former MEP who has clashed with the EU since entering government earlier this year, spoke as Mrs May faced pressure from senior Conservative Party figures not to cede any more ground to Brussels.  Her Chequers Plan sparked the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary and David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and while party figures have supported it, some have warned it should be a line in the sand rather than a flexible starting point for negotiations.  Mr Salvini, leader of hardline anti-immigrant party the League, said there was \"no objectivity or good faith from the European side\", adding: \"My experience in the European Parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you.\"  His hardline comments to The Sunday Times came after the PM and senior ministers embarked on a series of visits to EU27 countries in an attempt to get backing for her Chequers Plan.  On Thursday, the Brexit blueprint was dealt a severe blow by Brussels when Michel Barnier, its chief negotiator, rejected the customs proposals that form a key plank of the UK Government\u0026rsquos White Paper.  On Friday, Mrs May received a welcome boost after Austria agreed that Brexit would be among topics for discussion at a forthcoming informal meeting of EU leaders.  Downing Street said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed that Britain\u0027s departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country - which currently holds the EU presidency - on September 20.  It means the PM has an extra gathering of leaders to try to convince them to support her Brexit plan after a week in which ministers have been deployed to various capitals to woo senior politicians.  The next meeting is a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels in October, by which time it is hoped a Brexit deal will have been hammered out.  Meanwhile, Mrs May has been backed by her local Conservative Association chairman.  Richard Kellaway said the Maidenhead branch \"fully supported\" her plan and he had been impressed by a briefing on it for association heads in Downing Street.  \"Most of us found it quite persuasive and convincing. We have received little criticism from our members. I\u0027m of the group of people who feel that it is not a great deal but it is not bad. We have to actually have a deal,\" he added.  However, Mr Kellaway was earlier quoted by The Sunday  as warning: \u0026ldquoIf it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable.  Elsewhere, Lawyers for Britain said that the Chequers Plan would mean UK courts would continue to be ruled by the EU.  Its Chairman, Martin Rowe, accused the PM of a \u0026ldquowholesale abandonment of her promises made in the Tory manifesto and in her Lancaster House speech.  \u0026ldquoWithin the common rulebook areas at least, it is quite clear that the interpretation of the laws applying within the UK will continue to be carried out by judges in Luxembourg with judges in the UK having only a subservient role, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-russell-signals-scots-government-considering-stockpiling-medicines-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The UK Government has already made clear that it is making contingency plans to maintain supplies of food and medicine in the event of a no-deal, stressing how the public should be comforted and reassured that it is doing so.

Sir Michael pointed out how, in terms of insulin: \"We import every drop of it.\"  It is believed that insulin is among the medicines the UK Government is now considering stockpiling.  However, in Scotland, health care is devolved and Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, made clear: \u0026ldquoWe do not know what plans or assumptions the UK Government are making but we will do everything we need to do and take whatever practical action is required should we have to.  His remarks came as reports claimed the armed forces were on standby to help distribute medicines, food and fuel to vulnerable communities if Britain were to crash out of the EU without a deal.  The pro-EU Labour peer Lord Adonis said: \"Having our nation\u0027s defenders on stand-by for a no-deal Brexit just shows the radical lengths this Government will go to, to force through its extreme agenda.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-got-his-number-out-to-grass-hey-jack","story":"  BIG problem in Scottish prisons just now is the number of hidden mobile phones.

Says Jack: \"I volunteered to review the concert. I was a really keen guitarist myself but when I saw Hendrix take the stage and open up with Sgt Pepper\u0027s my head exploded.  \"I rushed back to the office and I seem to remember the thrust of my review was, \u0027I have seen the future of rock n\u0026rsquo roll.

Passengers had suffered the worst disruption on the network since services began in September 2014, the National Audit Office (NAO) reported.  A long-running dispute over driver-only trains between Southern and unions saw commuters in the South East of England endure years of misery with repeated strikes and disrupted services.  The NAO found that, while industrial action was a \u0026ldquomajor contributor to delays and cancellations, the Department for Transport (DfT) made decisions which \u0026ldquohave negatively impacted on passengers.  Govia Thameslink Railway was also hit by the overhaul of timetables in May.  -Fares  Mr Grayling was criticised for taking a trip to Qatar when the biggest rail fare rises for five years were announced in January.  He insisted he had not \u0026ldquoshirked the issuebut admitted they were \u0026ldquohigher than I would wish.  Labour said his travel abroad \u0026ldquosmacked of a man running scared as the cost of train tickets rose by an average of 3.4%.  \u0026ndash East Coast Main Line franchise  The line between London and Edinburgh was brought back under public control in May after an agreement with Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) ended five years early.  Mr Grayling said the parent companies of VTEC \u0026ndash Stagecoach and Virgin \u0026ndash had \u0026ldquogot their bid wrong in terms of the revenue from the franchise, which was originally due to run until 2023.  Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Mr Grayling had \u0026ldquogifted Stagecoach and Virgin, who took over in 2015, a \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2 billion bailout after they failed on the major route.  \u0026ndash Northern Rail  Mr Grayling faced a vote of no confidence \u0026ndash but survived \u0026ndash in the wake of Northern\u0026rsquos chaotic timetable collapse in June.  He had rejected calls for Northern to be renationalised, although he accepted the situation experienced by passengers was \u0026ldquounacceptable.

Dozens of people waited in line to vote outside many polling stations in Harare, the capital.  \u0026ldquoI want to do this and get on with my business. I am not leaving anything to chance. This is my future, said Emerina Akenda, a first-time voter.  Thousands of election monitors have fanned out across the country to observe a process that the opposition says is biased against them despite electoral commission assurances that it will be credible.  The two main contenders are 75-year-old president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former deputy president who took over after Mr Mugabe stepped down under military pressure last year, and 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa, a lawyer and pastor who became head of the main opposition party a few months ago after the death of its leader Morgan Tsvangirai.  A record of more than 20 presidential candidates and nearly 130 political parties are participating.  If no presidential candidate wins 50% of the vote, a runoff will be held on September 8.  \u0026ldquoThis is a critical moment in Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos democratic journey, said Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former Liberian president and a leader of one of the international observer missions.  \u0026ldquoThe elections today provide an opportunity to break with the past, Ms Sirleaf said at a polling station in a school in Harare.  \u0026ldquoThe lines and voter enthusiasm we are seeing this morning must be matched by an accurate count and their choice must be honoured.

If Taylor wins it would be a huge achievement and if she won the UK title this would be a massive deal for her.”The winner of the Miss Galaxy pageant will travel to the USA with contestants from all over the world to compete in the Miss Galaxy International final, which is being held next summer.As well as taking part in the pageant, Taylor will have to carry out charity work.This will not be a problem for Taylor as she loves to help people who are in need and now attends Inspire Soaps in Inverurie.She has chosen to fundraise for The Christie Charity, which provides services for those with cancer.

Following its March launch at Mackie’s of Scotland’s 19.2 parlour, fans had been going nutty for the ever-flowing tap, consuming more than 5kg in the first week.                                                    But the Aberdeen parlour has now said goodbye to the dessert topper – which was being outperformed by its neighbouring ever-flowing chocolate tap, dispensing Mackie’s own milk chocolate – made just 19.2 miles away on the family farm.                                                    Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.                                                                                                        Although the departure of the tap will come as sad news for many nut butter lovers, those looking for a new topping for their desserts won’t have to wait too long, as Mackie’s is close to finalising the tap’s replacement flavour.Yvette added: “I don’t want to give too much away just yet, but for many this will be a taste of their childhood and an all-round favourite for waffles, crepes and sundae scoops.“The new tap could well be ready to go in the next week so make sure you head down to the parlour and be one of the first to try our new creation.”In addition to the success of the taps, Mackie’s is also on course for their most successful summer of sales ever.                                                                                                        The family firm recorded its strongest ever ice cream sales in its 30-plus year history in May – a figure surpassed in June, thanks to the warm summer and growing export sales.Mackie’s of Scotland produces luxury ice cream at its fourth-generation family farm in Westertown, Aberdeenshire. The company started producing ice cream in 1986 using milk and dairy from its own herds. Mackie’s distributes its products to the UK and worldwide.

The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Monday 30 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Monday 30 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

Is Edinburgh in danger of killing the golden goose by pricing artists out of appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe? £500 for an overnight hotel stay is an eye-watering sum. But prices are high right across Scotland. Even in June a popular booking site had no hotel or bed and breakfast availability in the Oban and Lorn area for the entire week. A trip to Eigg earlier this month found only a couple of B\u0026ampBs for £70-£100 in the Mallaig-Arisaig area and “No vacancy” signs outside every camp/caravan site. Luckily, I stayed with friends whose summer months are now busy and sociable with cost-cutting visits from friends and family. When they travel elsewhere in Scotland, they do the same. It’s a great way to live and travel – if you have a wheen of like-minded, far-flung acquaintances with plenty of space. But if you don’t, the novel combination of brilliant summer weather and high staycationing demand from the rest of Britain creates a problem. Put simply, Scotland is fast becoming an impossibly expensive holiday location for folk actually living here.            The collapse in sterling since Brexit means a £100 bed and breakfast is less daunting for Europeans who also plan ahead. But Scots, prompted to explore their own country at the last minute by prolonged good weather and the relatively higher costs of foreign travel, are finding day trips or wild camping are the only “holidays” they can afford.            It doesn’t have to be like this.Across northern Europe and the world’s wooded latitudes, wooden weekend huts have traditionally come to the rescue, removing locals from the commercial holiday market and offering the possibility of long, leisurely stays during the summer, extended family reunions at Easter and sanity-restoring breaks every weekend throughout the year. Norway has the world’s highest GDP and the highest rate of hut ownership, with one basic wooden hut for every ten Norwegians. In 2006, there were 429,093 holiday homes in Norway, of which the vast majority (398,884) were huts rather than converted farmhouses (30,209) in a population of 4.6 million. A further 55,000 holiday homes were owned by Norwegians abroad. That’s one hytte (hut) per 11 Norwegians (roughly one per extended family) for year-round relaxation, connection with nature, exercise, escape from city pressures and strengthening family ties. Few huts have running water (thanks to freezing winters) although some have electricity and most are custom-built with wood-burning stoves. They are close enough to reach every weekend (usually within 25 miles and one hour’s drive) and the hytte habit is a marker of wealth, not poverty. Norway is one of the world’s most equal societies, and since second homes are generally modest purpose-built huts, not family homes from the local housing stock, ownership isn’t regarded as elitist, greedy or wasteful. A smart system called boplikt has created two separate housing markets by designating huts as temporary and family homes as permanent dwellings. Houses in each category cannot have a change of use. Thus family houses in remote areas cannot be bought or used as second homes. In 1991 there was also one cabin per 12 Swedes, one per 18 Finns and one per 33 Danes, along with widespread cabin ownership in Russia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain plus America, Canada and New Zealand.Scotland has the lowest rate of hut ownership in northern Europe. In 2000 only 630 huts remained in Scotland – most without rights of tenancy or improvement. Since then hundreds have been evicted, although Carbeth hutters raised almost £2 million to achieve a land buyout in 2013.            Of course, not everyone wants a basic, back-to-nature, wooden hut. But thousands do. And unless working families find the land and encouragement to take up hutting, holidays here will continue to be a greater luxury than a package holiday abroad and unemployed Scots will remain walled up in city estates without hope of escape. Maybe that’s a bigger social problem than the prices facing artists at the Edinburgh Fringe?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775633.1532938928!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll half of uk voters would back three option brexit referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Half of UK voters would back a fresh three-option referendum on a final Brexit deal, Sky News has reported.                According to a new Sky News data poll, British public opinion has shifted sharply against Brexit, with two-thirds of the public - including a large number of Leave voters - believing the outcome of negotiations will have a negative impact on Britain.            The survey also revealed that half of UK voters would like to see a referendum asking between the deal suggested by the government, no deal and remaining in the EU.            With less than eight months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how trade will flow as Prime Minister Theresa May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, struggles to strike a deal with the bloc.READ MORE: Poll: Only a quarter of Brits back Theresa May over BrexitMay has stepped up planning for a so called “no-deal” Brexit that would see the world’s fifth largest economy crash out of the EU on March 29, 2019, a step that could spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond.The Sky poll showed 78 per cent of the public think May’s government is doing a bad job on negotiating Brexit, up 23 percentage points from March, while just 10 per cent thought the government was doing a good job.The poll also showed May’s approval rating has taken a substantial hit, falling to 24 per cent.             Voters were split on whether Brexit would be good or bad for the country, with 40 per cent saying it would be good and 51 per cent saying it would be bad.When asked to choose between three options - May’s deal, a no deal or staying in the EU - 48 percent said they would prefer to stay in the EU, 27 percent wanted to leave with no deal and 13 percent would opt for the government’s deal.Eight percent said they would not vote while 3 percent did not know.Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,466 Sky customers online 20-23 July 2018.

No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays.

Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"communities minister makes isles her first port of call ","story":"\nCabinet secretary Aileen Campbell pours soap mixture into a mould under the watchful eye of Louise Jamieson.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8578786.1532509495!/image/image.jpg","title":"nikita in the frame in specsavers contest","story":"\nDromore woman Nikita Harron is in the frame to be crowned Spectacle Wearer of the Year after making it through to the regional finals of the Specsavers popular annual competition.\n\n                \nNikita. who is a customer of the Lisburn branch of the opticians, was chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for the nationwide competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nNikita, who is shortlisted in the 16 - 24 category. could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning £10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual Spectacle Wearer of the Year Awards. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe was recently invited to the Lisburn store to a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a £125 glasses voucher.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“Hearing that I was shortlisted for my category was fantastic.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27.

A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
