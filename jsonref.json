One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. It wrapped filming in December and he has scarcely been seen since then . The film comes out in November           During his visit in Moscow, Depp also visited the Mayakovsky museum where, in one image, he looked happy and healthy as he posed with staff          A third image, taken in Moscow earlier in the week during a visit to a state museum, provoked more concern. Depp is pictured with one of the museum\u0027s staff The production wrapped filming last year and Depp was praised by some for his conduct on set including a handful of extras who said he \u0027couldn\u0027t have been nicer\u0027. It was however alleged that he asked a production staffer to punch him during one incident. According to sources cited by Page Six, Depp allegedly asked the staffer to punch him and said he would give him $100,000 to do so. His representatives did not comment at the time.             Depp is pictured in June, 2017, at Glastonbury festival in England when he had a full head of hair and fuller face           Depp is pictured with ex-wife Amber Heard in September, 2015.

Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974           In the early 1970s, it was a top tourist destination, with golden sands, high-rise hotels and shopping precincts, frequented by the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Pictured, a soldier stands in front of a derelict plane  The airport\u0027s dilapidated planes with peeling paint and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus. A control tower which once watched over the busy skies around Nicosia International Airport also stands derelict          Everything here has been frozen in time since 1974 - the year of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, , codenamed Operation Attila by Turks who opposed a union with Greece          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south          The city of Nicosia is the only ided capital city in the world - separated by a UN \u0027green line\u0027 buffer zone. Around 112 miles long, it ides the Turkish-occupied northern part of the island from the independent Republic of Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely     The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies          \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 Capt Marneros said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          Nicosia International Airport was once the main airfield for Cyprus, but it has taken on a \u0027ghostly\u0027 appearance after being been shut to passengers for 44 years. Located near the Cypriot capital of Nicosia, this airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 – three years after a coup d’etat by Greek nationalists and an invasion by Turkish forces          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          Smoke rises from bomb explosions during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974          The July invasion eventually resulted in some 3 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced, while about 37 per cent of the island was occupied in the second Turkish invasion the following month          Grief-stricken relatives contemplate the fate of their loved ones who have gone missing during the invasion          British troops hand out food rations to Cypriot refugees during the crisis          Desperate Islanders clasp photographs of their loved ones who have vanished since Turkey invaded Cyprus          Turkish troops during the July invasion.

The hippo had been attacking younger animals and needed to be darted to it could be moved out of harms way \u0027The hippo had lacerations and various other wounds due to pod fights some of which were serious as he was a very aggressive hippo that was challenging and injuring many of the other male hippos.\u0027He had already killed two calves hence the decision for a search mission in daylight which is difficult as tranquilising it is not easy as you don\u0027t want the hippo rushing back into the water and drowning.\u0027But he was safely captured and moved by truck to his new home\u0027 he said.Hippo\u0027s can weigh up to 2 tons and this one was estimated to be about 1.5 tons.They are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa and kill an estimated 500 people every year.They were very common in the Western Cape but were exterminated in the region by the 1800\u0027s but the hippo\u0027s at Quila form part of a large pod that was reintroduced to the area nearly 20 years ago. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/16/4D0E263F00000578-5817855-Wide_receiver_Terrell_Owens_81_of_the_Philadelphia_Eagles_runs_p-a-5_1528472335803.jpg","title":"Terrell Owens wont attend Hall Fame induction","story":"    Terrell Owens #81 of the Cincinnati Bengals warms up before the game against the Dallas Cowboys during the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game           Wide receiver Terrell Owens #81 of the Philadelphia Eagles runs past safety Kim Herring #22 of the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half of their preseason game on August 26, 2005          Terrell Owens #81 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates in the end zone after scoring a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys with 12 seconds left on December 8, 2002 at Texas Stadium in Irving, TexasAlthough he has not revealed the full reason behind his snub, Owens said in his statement: \u0027After visiting Canton earlier this year, I came to the realization that I wish to celebrate what will be one of the most memorable days of my life, elsewhere. \u0027At a later date, I will announce where and when I will celebrate my induction.\u0027One sports writer concluded that Owens was \u0027snubbing the Pro Football Hall of Fame of his presence at the induction ceremony this year after being snubbed the past two years\u0027.

I’m a Grandma saying Shame On You.’Another posted that he was ‘dishonoring’ fellow inductees, Canton Ohio and its citizens.   File photo from 2012: Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Terrell Owens stands on the sidelines during the first half of an NFL football preseason game against the Tennessee TitansAnd while others begged him to reconsider, some simply congratulated him for giving so much to the sport.The hall confirmed that the former All-Pro receiver informed them he would not be on hand on August 4 for the enshrinements.\u0027We are disappointed but will respect Terrell\u0027s decision not to participate in the enshrinement,\u0027 Hall of Fame President \u0026amp CEO David Baker said.\u0027While unprecedented, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the nearly 5,000 volunteers and the entire community are committed to celebrating the excellence of the Class of 2018 that will kick off the NFL\u0027s 99th season.Share this article\u0027As we do not want to detract from this great honor being enjoyed by the seven other members of the class of 2018 – Bobby Beathard, Robert Brazile, Brian Dawkins, Jerry Kramer, Ray Lewis, Randy Moss and Brian Urlacher – their family, friends, and fans, the Pro Football Hall of Fame will have no further comment on the decision made by Terrell Owens.\u0027Owens entered the league as a third-round pick by San Francisco in 1996 and developed into a star known for some memorable playoff appearances.This includes his winning 25-yard TD catch to beat Green Bay in 1999, his 177 yards in a comeback win against the Giants in 2003, and his nine catches for 122 yards in the 2004 Super Bowl against New England just seven weeks after breaking his leg.  Former NFL player Terrell Owens arrives at the ESPY Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles (file photo)He ranks second to Jerry Rice with 15,934 yards receiving and is third on the all-time touchdowns receiving list with 153.Owens heavily criticized the voting process when he failed to be elected in 2016 and 2017. Among the reasons he fell short were his being considered a isive teammate and negative presence in the locker room.Still, he received strong consideration for the hall before getting in last February, along with Moss, another standout receiver.\u0027I think T.O. actually was disappointed when he got in this year,\u0027 said Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News, who presented Owens\u0027 case for induction and has been on the selection committee for 16 years.\u0027I think he was happier when he got snubbed and could play the part of the persecuted victim and moan on every radio talk show that was willing to bring him on about the unfairness of the process.\u0027Maybe he was worried that he would become forgotten after the induction ceremony. This way, he gets his gold jacket, but still will be remembered as the guy who told the hall to go stuff it,\u0027 he added.Another Owens supporter in the hall voting, Jarrett Bell of USA Today, has been on the selection committee for 21 years and was \u0027at a loss to understand\u0027 why Owens would decline to attend the inductions.But Bell, like Baker, stressed Owens\u0027 absence would not affect the ceremony much.\u0027Think of the other members of the class of 2018,\u0027 Bell said. He added: \u0027They deserve their upcoming honor and the celebration. There\u0027s no stain on them because someone doesn\u0027t want to show up.\u0027Think of the players who gave their all to the sport, including many worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, who will never be enshrined. \u0027Think of the family members of former players, coaches and officials – many of whom have passed away – pushing for their loved ones to receive special recognition for career accomplishments. Then think of Terrell Owens. In that order.\u0027          Terrell Owens  attends Nickelodeon\u0027s 2018 Kids\u0027 Choice Awards at The Forum on March 24, 2018 in Inglewood, CaliforniaIn a possible indicator that he might skip the August ceremony, Owens did not attend the announcement that he had been selected to the hall.\u0027All these years Owens wanted to go to the hall and was quite vocal about it,\u0027 said Rick Gosselin, a hall voter for 23 years.\u0027Now he doesn\u0027t want to go to the hall?

The set, made up of 5,550 pieces and a custom-made landscape ten square metres large          Mr Wrobel  gave up work full-time work around five years ago and decided he had enough figurines to recreate the battle.

The 4m x 2.5m diorama representing the actual battlefield of 6km x 4km dominates a loft extension. Mr Wrobel told Kent Live: \u0027My eldest son moved out about five years ago. hat was probably the other catalyst - I finally had a room to do it.\u0027He was very upset,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said in jest, \u0027he can\u0027t come back - he would have to sleep under the table.\u0027 \u0027I would not want my wife to know the total cost,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said, \u0027but it will run into thousands of pounds.          Mr Wrobel spent hours studying what the battlefield at the Battle of Waterloo looked like in order to create the best possible replica of the scene          Mr Wrobel holds up two figurines which are part of his 5,550-strong collection. Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display          The level of detail that has gone into finishing this replica of the Battle of Waterloo is second to none. The trees, houses, fields and land have been copied to match what the scene looked like in 1815\u0027She thinks it\u0027s insane. She can\u0027t understand why anybody could be the least bit interested.\u0027But having seen the finished project I think even she can feel the wow factor.\u0027Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display.He said: \u0027Waterloo was a seminal battle in history that marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars - and it\u0027s also the same date as my birthday.\u0027The uniforms of that period are very colourful so it is visually very impressive.\u0027And then when I semi-retired I thought I was not far off having all the figures for Waterloo, and I thought I better build the landscape for it. That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

That same month, Xi was given a path to indefinite rule when the the Communist-led rubber-stamp parliament lifted presidential term limits.China is mired in tough negotiations with the United States to avoid a trade war, while Moscow has deep differences with Washington on multiple diplomatic fronts, including Syria and Ukraine.Putin played up his bond with his \u0027good friend\u0027 Xi in an interview with China\u0027s state broadcaster CGTN this week.He said the Chinese president was the only state leader to celebrate his birthday with him, with the two sharing vodka and sausage.Xi \u0027is approachable and sincere\u0027, Putin told CGTN. \u0027But he\u0027s also a very dependable man to work with.\u0027          Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People Maria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University in the US, said China makes Russia look \u0027stronger and more relevant\u0027 on the global stage.For its part, Russia allows China to show the US that it has \u0027other options\u0027 in international negotiations, she said.\u0027Trump\u0027s policies justified (the) growing closeness, especially for Russia but also for China given the volatile relationship with the United States,\u0027 Repnikova said.But \u0027it\u0027s an asymmetrical relationship with Russia more dependent on China than vice versa, especially in the economic sphere,\u0027 she said.After the Beijing visit, Putin will join Xi at a weekend summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.China and Russia lead the regional security group, which includes former Soviet states and new members India and Pakistan.Putin told CGTN that the SCO had \u0027small\u0027 objectives when it was founded two decades ago but that it was now evolving into a larger global force.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country is an observer member of the SCO, will also attend the summit at a time when China and Russia are seeking to save the Iran nuclear deal following Trump\u0027s withdrawal from the pact. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D0C01EC00000578-5820973-image-m-84_1528457155185.jpg","title":"Vatican document suggests role married priests women Amazon","story":"    Latest move from Pope Francis will help combat a lack of priests all over the worldThe Vatican called Friday for courageous proposals to cope with a shortage of priests in the Amazon, and said it wouldn\u0027t rule out debate on whether married men could step in to fill the \u0027precariously-thin presence\u0027 of the Catholic Church in the vast region. In a preparatory document seeking input from South American bishops for the Vatican\u0027s 2019 meeting on the Amazon, organizers also said the church must identify new \u0027official ministries\u0027 for women to play in the region.The call was not a suggestion that women could be ordained priests, which Catholic doctrine forbids and Pope Francis has reaffirmed.But it leaves open the door to making official some ministries that women in remote parts of Latin America already perform, including celebrating baptisms.The synod will include bishops and other representatives from the nine countries of the Amazon basin, including indigenous peoples.The document re-states Pope Francis\u0027 calls to protect the Amazon from business and consumer greed, saying its natural habitat is vital for the planet.It calls for a solution to the lack of priests to say Mass for people in the area of more than seven and a half million sq km (more than three million square miles).          The synod will include bishops from nine countries of the Amazon basin, including indigenous peoples\u0027One of the main points to be heard is the cry of thousands of communities deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time,\u0027 the document says.Only priests can say Mass. The document calls for a \u0027process of discernment\u0027 within the Church to respond to the \u0027concrete realities of the Amazonian people\u0027.It says the Church presence in the Amazon basin \u0027has been spread precariously thin\u0027 because of the vast territory and its cultural ersity.The synod is expected to discuss the possibility of ordaining \u0027viri probati\u0027 - Latin for men of proven character - to deal with the shortage of priests. Such men would be elderly, outstanding members of the local Catholic community and with grown-up families.Pope Francis, in an interview with a German newspaper last year, said he was willing to consider ordaining older married men as priests in isolated communities.But he ruled out opening the priesthood to all married men or watering down the Catholic Church´s commitment to celibacy, seen as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.Pressed by reporters at a news conference about \u0027viri probati,\u0027 Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said: \u0027The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement.\u0027But he urged patience and caution. \u0027Let\u0027s leave the time necessary for reflection about everything that is in here.\u0027Some Catholic scholars have said the approval of \u0027viri probati\u0027 in the Amazon may eventually pave the way for their use elsewhere in the world as a response to the shortage of priests.The preparatory document also says that, given the size of the region: \u0027It is necessary to identify the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women, taking into account the central role which women play today in the Amazonian Church.\u0027The document did not elaborate. It ended with a 30-point questionnaire in which members of the Church in the Amazon were invited to give their opinion of the main challenges facing the area.

Pippa then launched the party planning online magazine Party Times, perhaps drawing inspiration from her family’s own business in the same industry.Pippa later published the book Celebrate after becoming renowned around the world following her sister Kate’s wedding. However, it did not perform well and many thought that the book did not bring anything new to the table.She has written for a number of publications including The Spectator, The Sunday Telegraph and was named the contributing editor of Vanity Fair in 2013.

The meal came to $6 and Bourdain said he picked up the check          Bourdain, right, with his father, who was a record executive, and his brother, Chris the family lived in suburban New Jersey and vacationed on the Jersey Shore and in France          Bourdain became executive chef at Les Halles in New York City, where he was working when he published his best-selling book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary UnderbellyIn high school, he began dabbling in drugs and clashing with his parents he fell for an older girl named Nancy Putkoski, who \u0027ran with a druggie crowd,\u0027 according to a New Yorker profile of Bourdain published last year. At one point, his mother told him: \u0027I love you dearly, but, you know, I don’t like you very much at present,\u0027 the piece continued. Bourdain followed Nancy to Vassar, where he wrote papers for classmates in exchange for drugs - though he dropped out after a short time and worked at a restaurant on Cape Cod before attending culinary school.He married Putkoski in 1985 and worked for years as a chef around New York City. All the while he dreamed of writing but he also fell victim to heavy drug use, buying his first bag of heroin in 1980 - when he \u0027plunged into addiction with his usual gusto,\u0027 the New Yorker wrote.\u0027When I started getting symptoms of withdrawal, I was proud of myself,\u0027 he said.            Bourdain\u0027s book chronicled the backroom workings of restaurants and the frenetic lives of chefs he battled cocaine and heroin addiction himself    Following the success of his 2000 bestseller, Bourdain began hosting television shows focused on travel and cuisineHe compared his first marriage to \u0027the Gus Van Sant film Drugstore Cowboy, in which Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch play drug addicts who rob pharmacies in order to support their habit,\u0027 the profile wrote.\u0027That kind of love and codependency and sense of adventure—we were criminals together,\u0027 he said. \u0027A lot of our life was built around that, and happily so.\u0027 Bourdain also talked about \u0027being pulled over by the cops with two hundred hits of blotter acid in the car, being stalked by the Drug Enforcement Administration while trying to retrieve a letter from Panama at the post office.\u0027He said he was tired of \u0027getting ripped off, running from the cops\u0027 and quit cold turkey but spent several more years addicted to cocaine, he told the New Yorker,\u0027 adding that he \u0027bottomed out on crack.\u0027\u0027Occasionally, between fixes, he would find himself digging paint chips out of the carpet in his apartment and smoking them, on the off chance that they were pebbles of crack,\u0027 the New Yorker piece explained. \u0027Things grew so bad that Bourdain recalls once sitting on a blanket on Broadway at Christmastime, with his beloved record collection laid out for sale.\u0027He kicked the habit, however, and continued working in restaurants - though he was also nursing a dream of being a writer. His first novel, Bone in the Throat, was published in 1995, followed by another, Gone Bamboo. Neither was particularly successful, but his real break came after he secured the executive chef job at New York restaurant Les Halles. He wrote the book Kitchen Confidential, a no-holds-barred, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant world that flew off the shelves. That led to his first television show, A Cook’s Tour – which set him on a path that would make him a recognizable face and a household name.It also led to the demise of his marriage to Putkoski.‘She identified television early on as an existential threat to the marriage,’ Bourdain told the New Yorker. ‘I felt like the whole world was opening up to me. I’d seen things. I’d smelled things. I desperately wanted more. And she saw the whole thing as a cancer.’‘I was ambitious, she was not. I have a rampaging curiosity about things, and she was content, I think, to be with me. To go to the Caribbean once a year. There were things that I wanted, and I was willing to hurt somebody to have them,’ added Bourdain, calling the separation ‘the great betrayal’ of his life.This was followed by No Reservations on the Travel Channel and Parts Unknown on CNN, the channel he was working for at the time of his death. Bourdain earned a reputation for fully immersing himself in local cultures as well as trying adventurous cuisine he also did not shy away from controversy. When he and his team went to Beirut to film an episode but had to be evacuated due to conflict, for example, he incorporated it into the episode.          Bourdain first began dabbling in drugs in high school after falling for an older girl, Nancy Putkoski, who ran with a \u0027druggie crowd,\u0027 according to a New Yorker profile published last year she would become his first wife before they orced in 2005. He blamed his burgeoning television career and ambition for the split and called it \u0027the great betrayal\u0027 of his life          Bourdain married his second wife, Octavia Busia (pictured), in 2007, eleven days after she gave birth to the couple\u0027s daughter, Ariane he and Busia were set up by his best friend, Le Bernardin owner Eric Ripert - who found Bourdain\u0027s body at a hotel in France. The couple decided to orce in 2016          Bourdain left his kitchen career to travel to far-flung corners of the world and film shows about the local customs, people and cuisineAnd as his star rose and his career blossomed, Bourdain found love again – after being set up by his best friend, Le Bernardin chef and owner Eric Ripert, the man who found him dead this week. Ripert introduced him to an Italian woman who worked in one of his restaurants, Octavia Busia, who was more than 20 years his junior. But the pair hit it off and decided to have children she gave birth to their daughter, Ariane, in 2007, and they married 11 days later.‘I was 50 when I became a father of a little girl,’ Bourdain said in 2013. ‘I was finally old enough to be qualified for the job. Ariane has me wrapped around her finger. All I can realistically hope for is that she feels loved. That she has high self-esteem.’Last dance: Anthony Bourdain smiles and swigs beer with Asia...\u0027Unapologetic, passionate and one of the best storytellers...Share this articleHe and Busia orced in 2016, and he began dating actress Asia Argento two years ago.‘It’s not much of a change of life style, as we have lived separate lives for many years,’ Bourdain told the New Yorker of his orce from Busia. ‘More of a change of address.\u0027 His show on CNN, Parts Unknown, premiered its eleventh season last month. During his television career, he earned five Emmys and a Peabody award. ‘We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy? What do you eat? What do you like to cook? And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions, we tend to get some really astonishing answers,’ he said.           Bourdain said: \u0027I was 50 when I became a father of a little girl.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.’ In a statement posted to Twitter, 42-year-old actress Argento remembered the 61-year-old celebrity chef as \u0027brilliant\u0027 and her \u0027protector\u0027.\u0027Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did.

Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974           In the early 1970s, it was a top tourist destination, with golden sands, high-rise hotels and shopping precincts, frequented by the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Pictured, a soldier stands in front of a derelict plane  The airport\u0027s dilapidated planes with peeling paint and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus. A control tower which once watched over the busy skies around Nicosia International Airport also stands derelict          Everything here has been frozen in time since 1974 - the year of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, , codenamed Operation Attila by Turks who opposed a union with Greece          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south          The city of Nicosia is the only ided capital city in the world - separated by a UN \u0027green line\u0027 buffer zone. Around 112 miles long, it ides the Turkish-occupied northern part of the island from the independent Republic of Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely     The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies          \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 Capt Marneros said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          Nicosia International Airport was once the main airfield for Cyprus, but it has taken on a \u0027ghostly\u0027 appearance after being been shut to passengers for 44 years. Located near the Cypriot capital of Nicosia, this airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 – three years after a coup d’etat by Greek nationalists and an invasion by Turkish forces          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          Smoke rises from bomb explosions during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974          The July invasion eventually resulted in some 3 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced, while about 37 per cent of the island was occupied in the second Turkish invasion the following month          Grief-stricken relatives contemplate the fate of their loved ones who have gone missing during the invasion          British troops hand out food rations to Cypriot refugees during the crisis          Desperate Islanders clasp photographs of their loved ones who have vanished since Turkey invaded Cyprus          Turkish troops during the July invasion.

The hippo had been attacking younger animals and needed to be darted to it could be moved out of harms way \u0027The hippo had lacerations and various other wounds due to pod fights some of which were serious as he was a very aggressive hippo that was challenging and injuring many of the other male hippos.\u0027He had already killed two calves hence the decision for a search mission in daylight which is difficult as tranquilising it is not easy as you don\u0027t want the hippo rushing back into the water and drowning.\u0027But he was safely captured and moved by truck to his new home\u0027 he said.Hippo\u0027s can weigh up to 2 tons and this one was estimated to be about 1.5 tons.They are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa and kill an estimated 500 people every year.They were very common in the Western Cape but were exterminated in the region by the 1800\u0027s but the hippo\u0027s at Quila form part of a large pod that was reintroduced to the area nearly 20 years ago. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/19/4D02C7B100000578-5818197-image-a-13_1528395199816.jpg","title":"Military fan finishes epic 30 year project build replica Wellingtons famous 1815 victory","story":"    Michael Wrobel at his home in Wadhurst East Sussex with his Scale model of the Battlefield of Waterloo          Semi-retired Michael Wrobel, 63, said his giant recreation has cost him thousands of pounds over the years.

Mr Wrobel spent hours studying what the battlefield at the Battle of Waterloo looked like in order to create the best possible replica of the scene          Mr Wrobel holds up two figurines which are part of his 5,550-strong collection. Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display          The level of detail that has gone into finishing this replica of the Battle of Waterloo is second to none.

That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

in his opinion - not been used often enough.The conservative Kurz became chancellor in December in a coalition with the anti-migration Freedom Party.In campaigning for last year\u0027s election, both coalition parties called for tougher immigration controls, quick deportations of asylum-seekers whose requests are denied and a crackdown on radical Islam.The government recently announced plans to ban girls in elementary schools and kindergartens from wearing headscarves, adding to existing restrictions on veils.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/11/4D0B6BC800000578-5820739-The_owner_laughs_as_her_dog_puts_his_paw_over_her_hand_so_she_ca-m-51_1528452700263.jpg","title":"Jealous Golden Retriever stops owner using phone","story":"    This is the adorable moment a jealous golden retriever is trying to stop his owner from using her phone and pay attention to him          The owner laughs as her dog puts his paw over her hand so she can pay attention to himThe owner looks up at the jealous golden retriever and scratches its nose. She then grabs the phone again, and her jealous dog puts it down again.Once again, she smiles and warmly rubs his back.The cute dog appears to be happy while his back is being rubbed.Meet Georgeous George the orphaned baby wombat has just been...Archer the koala, Albert the globefish and Sassy the wombat:...Share this articleAfter a while, the owner decides to leave her phone on the couch and laughs as she rubs the dog\u0027s back, neck and nose.Then, they just sit there just staring at each other before she grabs her phone again.Eventually the dog tries one more time to get rid of the phone from his owner\u0027s hand, and succeeds.The owner laughs and says, \u0027It\u0027s not even when I stop petting him,\u0027 about when he keeps putting her phone down.           The owner laughs and says, \u0027It\u0027s not even when I stop petting him,\u0027 about when he keeps putting her phone down   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/18/4D0E6A0900000578-5820757-image-a-27_1528478108762.jpg","title":"Set fair Appleby Thousands travellers globe enjoy sights","story":"    It\u0027s day two of the famous Appleby Horse Fair and thousands have arrived for the event which is seen as an opportunity for travellers to showcase their wares and swap notes about life on the road          Europe\u0027s biggest gipsy gathering usually plays host to around 10,000 gipsies and travellers, as well as 20,000 other people for several days of trade, competition and festivities          Pictured: Travellers show off their skills by racing their horses across the Cumbrian town\u0027s roads at daring speedsOne tradition that was stopped last year due to bad weather made its return this year, as horses took a dip in the River Eden to cool off.The ritual began in the 17th century as a way of washing the horses and making them more presentable for potential buyers.But the fun atmosphere was dampened today after a woman was knocked unconscious after being hit by a horse and carriage. Travellers cool off their animals as thousands begin...Tyson Fury \u0027buys Nando\u0027s for all 52 diners at restaurant...My big fat gypsy funeral: Mourners gather to say farewell to...Share this articleShe has been taken to hospital with head injuries and was left with a bloody eye following the incident.A witness explained how the horse was struggling to stay on the tarmac while being raced by a man before hearing a ‘big noise’. ‘It looked like a girl had tried to cross the road and she’d been hit and was knocked unconscious.

It has since partly recovered as the ruble has strengthened, reaching nearly $90 billion last year.Russia has also increasingly turned to China as a market for its energy exports and a source of investment in infrastructure projects.Meanwhile, analysts remarked on the similar leadership styles of the men.Xi and Putin are \u0027soulmates who want to make their countries great again\u0027, Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said.          Putin and Xi attend Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing ahead of a summit between the two countries and six Asian states\u0027Both share scepticism towards American hegemony and distrust US intentions, both are authoritarian personalistic rulers,\u0027 he said.Putin was re-elected to a fourth Kremlin term in March. That same month, Xi was given a path to indefinite rule when the the Communist-led rubber-stamp parliament lifted presidential term limits.China is mired in tough negotiations with the United States to avoid a trade war, while Moscow has deep differences with Washington on multiple diplomatic fronts, including Syria and Ukraine.Putin played up his bond with his \u0027good friend\u0027 Xi in an interview with China\u0027s state broadcaster CGTN this week.He said the Chinese president was the only state leader to celebrate his birthday with him, with the two sharing vodka and sausage.Xi \u0027is approachable and sincere\u0027, Putin told CGTN. \u0027But he\u0027s also a very dependable man to work with.\u0027          Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People Maria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University in the US, said China makes Russia look \u0027stronger and more relevant\u0027 on the global stage.For its part, Russia allows China to show the US that it has \u0027other options\u0027 in international negotiations, she said.\u0027Trump\u0027s policies justified (the) growing closeness, especially for Russia but also for China given the volatile relationship with the United States,\u0027 Repnikova said.But \u0027it\u0027s an asymmetrical relationship with Russia more dependent on China than vice versa, especially in the economic sphere,\u0027 she said.After the Beijing visit, Putin will join Xi at a weekend summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.China and Russia lead the regional security group, which includes former Soviet states and new members India and Pakistan.Putin told CGTN that the SCO had \u0027small\u0027 objectives when it was founded two decades ago but that it was now evolving into a larger global force.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country is an observer member of the SCO, will also attend the summit at a time when China and Russia are seeking to save the Iran nuclear deal following Trump\u0027s withdrawal from the pact. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/13/4D0BE61600000578-5821115-image-a-59_1528461138119.jpg","title":"Scorned woman bashes ex boyfriends Range Rover telling sh ing around","story":"    The woman appears to have rammed her ex\u0027s Range Rover to get revenge for his \u0027sh***ing around.\u0027 Do you know this woman?

Like GKN, Inmarsat, which employs more than 1,500 people, has provided technology used by the British armed forces, although its largest single customer is the US military.The London-based company, which has 13 communications satellites in orbit, provided satellite services to the Ministry of Defence to improve ground communications for soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.The firm has repeatedly won praise from the government thanks to its leadership position in the British space industry, excluding the Franco-German industrial group Airbus, which has sizeable operations in the UK but is French-owned.Former chancellor George Osborne praised Inmarsat in 2012 as he announced £1.2bn of funding over five years to increase Britain’s role in European space projects.The UK’s place in the European Space Agency, which is working on the €10bn Galileo satellite navigation system, is now uncertain amid the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Inmarsat is also a world leader in several cutting-edge technologies such as mobile satellite communications and maritime and aviation safety, while it is among the largest providers of inflight internet for airlines.Its four Global Xpress satellites provide the world’s only global high-speed broadband operation, with a fifth satellite due to launch next year to increase capacity. It is also working with Germany’s Deutsche Telekom on the European Aviation Network, which will provide high-speed broadband to air passengers across the continent.Despite Inmarsat’s leading position in several markets, New York-listed EchoStar is the larger company based on its stock market value of £3.4bn, compared with the UK firm’s £2.2bn after its stock market surge on Friday.EchoStar’s interest is likely to be fuelled in part by Inmarsat’s exposure to the US, given that the US military is the company’s largest single customer.But if the US firm persists with its bid, it could face political opposition similar to that seen during Melrose’s bid for GKN. A group of MPs urged the business secretary, Greg Clark, to block that deal on national security grounds. Security is one of the few reasons the government can prevent a takeover and the MPs cited fears that GKN could be broken up and sold to overseas buyers.A government spokesperson said: “While no formal bid or offer has been made, we are monitoring the situation. However, this is a commercial matter for the companies involved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21d9911dc3e0ca2f94080127771867805a28c6e/0_39_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbae87f6db077a40382d2692c0b00a18","title":"oxford street london traffic sadiq khan westminster","story":"Westminster city council’s decision to block the pedestrianisation of Oxford Street threatens to undermine Sadiq Khan’s hopes of a legacy that will be remembered for decades. Khan is now facing the biggest test of his mayoralty. If he allows the scheme to fall by the wayside, his tenure will be seen as a failure and London will be left with a shabby, polluted street as its once-famous commercial centre.Moreover, there is the arrival in December of Crossrail, whose trains will bring up to 1,200 people into the street’s two stations, Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street, from a single train – and there will be up to 24 per hour in each direction.Most cities in the world have learned that pedestrianised areas lead to an improved economy and a better environment and yet Westminster, a deeply reactionary Tory-led authority which makes tens of millions of pounds of profit from parking tickets and fines, insists London remain in the dark ages. Its Tory leader Nickie Aiken, who, astonishingly, revealed the council’s decision to block pedestrianisation on the very day House of Fraser announced it was closing its store, admitted in double negative speak that, “we do think that most people, ourselves included, feel that doing nothing is also not an option”.Yes, two-thirds of local people objected to the closure, but only because they feared more traffic on their local streets, which is unlikely to happen since only the buses and taxis currently allowed in Oxford Street will be displaced. So the effects will be minimal. More importantly, two-thirds of Londoners overall supported the plan and the mayor must show that he represents them, not the few misinformed nimbys of Westminster.Khan, quite rightly, condemned Westminster’s decision but that’s the easy bit. He seemed to make no commitment to pushing ahead with the scheme other than a vague pledge: “I won’t walk away from Oxford Street.” Neither has he set out any strategy about what action he could take. Westminster seems intent on stalling through yet more consultation, but the time for talking is over. Instead, Khan must show that he really believes in a policy that has widespread support across London.He could take lessons from his predecessor. Most of what Boris Johnson did as mayor was showboating, but his one success was the cycle superhighways. They are now used by tens of thousands of cyclists daily and yet, at the time, some key business interests, notably the Canary Wharf Group, threatened legal action, horrified by the thought that humble cyclists would be given priority over limos speeding along Lower Thames Street. The powerful taxi lobby was also intent on wrecking the scheme. Nevertheless, Boris – backed by his eccentric cycling commissioner Andrew Gilligan – held firm and the world-class route along the Embankment is his legacy.Gilligan was a genuine cycling proselytiser and campaigner Khan, on the other hand, has appointed a cycling and walking commissioner, Will Norman, who comes across as a bureaucrat. Khan has further weakened his position by having just replaced his deputy mayor for transport, Val Shawcross, with the former MP Heidi Alexander, who has no previous experience in transport.Khan must throw his natural caution to the wind and show Westminster he means business he can do this by cutting off any funds going to the council since every borough gets an allocation from Transport for London. He should continue to move bus routes away from Oxford Street, which in any case is a necessary step to closing the street to traffic, and he could even threaten to ban licensed cabs from Oxford Street. The very future of the centre of London is at stake.• Christian Wolmar is a writer and broadcaster specialising in transport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5366f6c5b6c1c8f886e408fc54e80631d58aa384/0_103_4347_2609/master/4347.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33f873594663451c3586845b37f20a92","title":"the guardian view on labour and brexit too timid too tactical","story":"This is a welcome new tone, but the aspiration for seamless trade with Europe is uncontroversial. The problem, as Theresa May has discovered, is the impossibility of achieving that goal while rejecting obligations of membership – contributions to EU budgets acceptance of European court arbitration free movement of people. The\u0026nbspimplication of Labour’s new line is that it would compromise on those points, yet the front bench is shy about saying so. What is billed as new policy is largely a rhetorical swerve, forced on the opposition by changes to the withdrawal bill in the House of Lords. Many opposition MPs support a peers’ amendment urging membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which would keep the UK in the single market. A brace of Tory MPs like that model, too, which makes it possible that the government could be forced to obey. Instead, Labour whips will split the soft Brexit vote, letting Mrs May off the hook.Why? A reasonable argument is that the EEA is an imperfect, off-the-shelf model that would lock the UK into too subordinate a relationship with Brussels, and that Labour cannot be seen to settle for such a mediocre\u0026nbspdeal. A fuller explanation includes isions in the party on a range of Brexit issues: immigration control the feasibility of another referendum whether or not the single market is an impediment to a radical left economic programme. Those tensions are in part ideological, but also reflect the awkward electoral calculus for a party whose members are broadly pro-European but whose seats in parliament include many leave-voting areas. So Jeremy Corbyn combines deference to the referendum outcome with reluctance to sound too enthusiastic about Brexit. It\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspnot an easy balance. The longer this goes on, the likelier it gets that frustration and disillusionment build on all sides.A year has passed since last year’s election and Labour has not built on the momentum it gathered then. Ambiguity around Mr Corbyn’s Brexit instincts was an advantage when leavers and remainers could each think their needs might be met by Labour. That effect is wearing off. A difference now is that departure day is much closer and Mrs May’s methods have brought the process to a murky impasse. Tory\u0026nbspsquabbling this week shows yet again how the prime minister is hemmed in by fanatics in her party. Michel Barnier, the commission’s chief negotiator, on Friday sounded justifiably dismissive of the government’s latest incoherent customs proposal.Labour has accepted the logic of maximum integration with the single market and customs union, thereby usurping terrain of economic rationality vacated by the government. But\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspCorbyn looks too often as if he has been bounced into sensible EU stances. When Labour does the right thing on Brexit it\u0026nbspsquanders the advantage by doing it gradually, almost reluctantly. The defence of that approach is that, on such a fissile subject, the opposition is better off lying low, avoiding upsetting people and waiting for the Tories to fail.That approach isn’t working, perhaps because it views Brexit through a narrow lens of party advantage when the crisis is of national dimensions. The vacancy is for politicians who will be unflinchingly honest about the difficulties ahead, the shape of the compromises required, and their cost. It is not enough to be ready, for the sake of party cohesion, to shuffle towards “the softest possible Brexit”. True courage and leadership require active, persistent, public advocacy to explain why that course is necessary in the interests of the whole\u0026nbspcountry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f666ab10569fa6709e49762d813c5e5acf09e79/0_162_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474cf70f250c1fa7961edbf641d7fbd8 720w","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Foraging wood ducks, an adder taking a dip and a fearless baby rabbit are among this week’s pick on images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e87f81d323dfcc986e5489db0a28af023925563/0_219_6580_3948/master/6580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb849648c8c97707781109992d91d3","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious.

In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp.

And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea.

Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

Considering only the group winners are guaranteed places in the finals – the best second-placed sides enter the play-offs – this was an important win for Neville before the potentially pivotal trip to Wales at the end of August.When England thrashed Russia 6-0 at Tranmere last September Parris opened the scoring. Relocated to Moscow, the Manchester City striker not only repeated the feat but registered her fifth goal in five World Cup qualifiers.After temporarily swapping flanks with Toni Duggan, Parris drifted inside, stole in front of her marker and connected with a precise right-wing cross from the Barcelona forward before heading beyond Russia’s goalkeeper, Yulia Grichenko.The Lionesses have clearly taken to Neville and the former Manchester United and Everton full-back looked pleased with his side’s performance on an awkward artificial surface.Another header, from Scott this time, doubled England’s advantage. Neville claims that Lucy Bronze could hold her own in the men’s game and the Lyon right-back – captaining the Lionesses in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton – proved she was far too strong for Russia by crossing brilliantly to the far post and picking out Scott’s late dash into the box.It was becoming almost too easy for Bronze and company which possibly explains why England’s captain momentarily lost concentration and allowed Russia to pull a goal back. After neglecting to clear her lines in the wake of a long throw Bronze failed to prevent a dangerous cross finding Elena Danilova unmarked. If the invitation was unexpected, Danilova had no hesitation in accepting it by rising unchallenged to head beyond the helpless Carly Telford.That was the first goal England had conceded along the qualifying road to France but Scott’s mobility ensured it did not take them long to restore a two-goal cushion. Walsh has been one of a number of young players introduced by Neville and she vindicated his judgment by finding her Manchester City team-mate with a beautifully weighted through-pass. By way of returning the compliment, Scott, making another clever late run into the area, volleyed her second goal of the match past Grichenko with the outside of her boot.Despite sporadic tactical tweaking, Russia failed to contain Kirby and her elusive movement between the lines. The Chelsea creator, shifted from attack to a slightly deeper attacking-midfield role under Neville, was frequently minded by Anna Kozhnikova, whose style was cramped when she incurred a booking for sending Kirby crashing on to that unforgiving surface.From the resultant free-kick Duggan tested Grichenko before making way for Beth Mead and, shortly afterwards, Ellen White was replaced by the similarly dangerous Jodie Taylor. Perhaps deterred by the strength of Neville’s bench, Russia had by now abandoned any early pretence of attacking and, dropping ever deeper, were grimly intent on damage limitation.Although the hosts belatedly escaped their own half as Telford saved smartly when left one on one against Ekaterina Sochneva, it was far too little too late for a Russian team whose prime ploy of attempting to foul Kirby out of the game appeared to be about the extent of an alarmingly limited game plan.

It’s a classic bit of Bourdain understatement. It’s true he was never a chef who was going to knock down culinary boundaries – Bourdain was schooled in the French classics – but as a writer he was massively influential, changing forever what the business of food and appetite on the page could be.Before the publication in 2000 of Kitchen Confidential, his memoir of life as a line cook, food writing was, for the most part, a job for those who had pulled their sizeable bellies up to the table in the dining room. It was effete and delicate. Bourdain gave a voice to the career cooks on the other side of the kitchen door the ramshackle, itinerant tribe of restaurant chefs, with their skin burns, tattoos, appetite for long hours and hard drugs. He made food writing muscular and kinetic. He blew the whistle on how your steak was likely to be cooked in a big New York restaurant – by being dumped in the deep fat fryer – and famously cautioned against eating sushi on Mondays, because the fish was less than fresh.Naturally enough, in time, there was a backlash. There were accusations that he was falsely glamorising a life of excess – one he had abandoned – though his fans from behind those kitchen doors wouldn’t hear a word against him. You could spot them a mile off at the public events which inevitably became part of the author’s working life: pallid skin, wild hair, clutching a stained volume they wanted to be signed.Although it was writing that gave him his profile, Bourdain’s biggest contribution to food media may well have been to television. His various series, first for the Food Network, then later the Travel Channel and CNN, had an immersive, nerdy quality that fixed the dishes he was eating to the communities and cultures from which they came. Without him, vast amounts of today’s food content – the various documentary strands, such as Ugly Delicious on Netflix – simply wouldn’t exist.I shot a sequence with him for a London-based show in the summer of 2016 at Fergus Henderson’s St John in Clerkenwell, which he regarded as a culinary temple. He made it clear it was now the mechanics of film-making that most intrigued him. He had no time for the usual artifice of TV: no retakes, no stop-starts, just shoot what happens. As he told the New Yorker in 2017: “I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do what the fuck I want.” The fact that Bourdain’s long, rambling journey has finally come to such a sad end will leave his army of fans, including this one, utterly bereft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7014e862c35271bdd5b3b91d2a295f7f79c530b9/0_74_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a244be16a81438bc54374d6e301765fb","title":"anthony bourdain a life in pictures","story":"TV chef and travel host Anthony Bourdain, who has died at 61, was best known for his book Kitchen Confidential and his long-running TV series No Reservations"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3bba005fd8ad206bf839ecc41a70dd04a747f7/0_236_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f70c30dfc62bcb398adccd5764a44a0","title":"bored by your playlists heres how to get out of your musical rut","story":"From Norwegian death metal to K-pop, there’s a whole world of sounds out there – avoiding musical paralysis has never been easierAccording to research by the music streaming service Deezer, around the age of 30 most of us stop discovering new music and listen to the same stuff over and over again. But there are ways to avoid this musical paralysis.Where random music discovery could once mean crate-digging for obscure vinyl, today Spotify and YouTube can both ease and stunt exploration. Avoid endless variations of what you normally play by making unexpected choices to confuse the algorithms you could try Norwegian death metal right after Chesney Hawkes.Delving into a pal’s collection – or asking them to make a playlist – can provide another source of new sounds. An older acquaintance may have rich musical knowledge, while a younger one can help with tricky, trendy genres. I recently borrowed a car and found Martha Wainwright’s brilliant debut lurking in the CD player.Venturing beyond English and American staples can throw up unknown pleasures, from Gallic pop to Afrofunk widening exposure to K-pop has helped the boyband BTS to storm the US charts.Eclectic festival line-ups and local or underground gigs can help experience unfamiliar music quickly, but you don’t even have to leave the house. Just turn off that favourite radio station and exit the comfort zone for the delights of the BBC Asian Network, say, or Rinse FM, to spend time with grime.Tracing an artist’s musical ancestry can be fascinating. For example, the 1975 listened to 80s pop and Brian Eno, and that snaking riff on the new single, Give Yourself a Try, derives from Joy Division’s (1979) Disorder.Learning to play is another gateway to musical adventures. Budding drummers may be exposed to Clyde “Funky Drummer” Stubblefield, while piano lessons can lead to tinkling along to Chopin – or Chas and Dave.I loathed opera until I saw ETO’s touring production of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin and reached a whole new understanding: it sounded like a massive goth band."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e89677e02944b5d01f249732669f7d76c21fc01c/0_392_4574_2744/master/4574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e514822f084da589c3e5644f4a15369","title":"lohengrin review klaus florian vogt royal opera house","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonDirector David Alden pushes the power politics in the war-ravaged setting for the ROH’s first new Lohengrin for 41 yearsIt’s 41 years since the Royal Opera introduced a new Lohengrin. That production, directed by Elijah Moshinsky and last seen in 2009, was a largely traditional affair, crammed with dark-ages Christian and pagan symbolism reflecting the strange mixture in Wagner’s libretto. Its replacement, directed by David Alden (his second new Covent Garden show of the season, after last autumn’s Semiramide), takes a very different line. Paul Steinberg’s designs and Gideon Davey’s costumes suggest a relocation to the first half of the 20th century, somewhere in central Europe. The skewed brick facades of the modular set, with their gaping windows and steel gangways and girders, imply a country ravaged by war and a society teetering on the brink of totalitarianism, a threat that becomes vividly real before the end of the opera.For Alden, it’s all about power politics – the story of an enfeebled king, so desperate to assert his authority that he wears his crown throughout, who sees the arrival of Lohengrin as the answer to his expansionist prayers and the means of turning around the fortunes of his beaten army. To King Friedrich, Elsa’s fate and, to some extent, the machinations of Ortrud and Telramund are subsidiary. Perhaps Ortrud’s invocation of the dark arts sits rather uneasily in this modern militaristic world, and there’s little symbolism here, except for the eruption of flags in the final scene, all emblazoned with a swan, which has become a fascist emblem. The only references to Christianity are the unavoidable ones in the text, while the famous wedding march at the beginning of the third act is wryly sent up on stage.As one would expect from this director, everything about the production is vividly detailed and thoughtfully cogent, typically lit from low angles to produce looming expressionist shadows and stark contrasts. Every one of the protagonists is sharply defined. There’s no boat and no swan for Lohengrin’s arrival or departure, just a lighting effect to suggest its beating wings, as the set splits to reveal Klaus Florian Vogt sitting on the ground, in a white suit and open-necked shirt, for all the world like a 1970s pop singer: a Bee Gee perhaps or Barry Manilow.Vogt begins and ends his role in a rather disembodied mezza voce, and if his tone never becomes exactly fulsome, he is always compelling, especially when singing quietly. Every word counts, and Lohengrin’s revelation of who he is in the final scene is spellbinding. He’s well matched also to the Else of Jennifer Davis, who conveys innocence and vulnerability in a thoroughly musical way. A product of the Jette Parker young artists’ scheme, Davis is a lyric soprano with a bit of extra steel, and a more than plausible actor. Their antagonists are nicely complementary, too – if Thomas J Mayer’s ranting Telramund sometimes strays into pantomime-villain territory, he contrasts perfectly with this Ortrud, as Christine Goerke moves from icy control to avenging vamp at the flick of a switch, even if the vocal ride is bumpy at times.Together with Georg Zeppenfeld’s vacillating king and Kostas Smoriginas’s threatening, crippled Herald, they all fit perfectly into Alden’s dramatic scheme, and integrate just as smoothly into Andris Nelsons’ musical one. Nelsons’ gloriously comprehensive conducting, full of moments of quiet, rapt intensity and surging, tremulous excitement, superbly realised by the ROH Orchestra, is one of this new production’s biggest plusses of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843ae6dcd8ba6993b9776e7085b0d3cc13982943/130_0_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36f27eef00fb53451677cae21d4fecde","title":"gypsy damian le bras road traveller roots","story":"It is Friday night. I’m 30 years old, alone on a fake-fur blanket in the back of a cold Transit van. Most of my generation are out there in pubs, or indoors by the telly, canoodling, arguing or cooking, or going across to the thermostat to turn the heating up. I’m parked on a Cornish industrial estate with no warmth except the tiny, wavering plume of heat that rises out of my lantern. This place is so lonesome that even the doggers, boy-racers and stoners have spurned it. I curse myself silently. You’re not a Traveller, my mate, you’re a . What sort of Traveller would come and sleep here on their own? I have covered thousands of miles in my van in a bid to uncover the history of Gypsy Britain. But the road is proving tough.Gypsy reality is partly composed of fairgrounds and showgrounds, picturesque lakeside halts, sheltered commons, bright heaths. But it also comprised frozen copses and hilltops. Old maintenance roads with potholes and bad light. Scrapyards. Council waste ground. Lay-bys near the edges of tips. Slag-heaps and drained marshes. Fen ends. Chalk pits, yards and quarries. These are the stopping places, these fringes and in-between places. They are the places that nobody lives except Travellers – or nobody but those who share ancient connections with them: gamekeepers and poachers, scrap-metal men, horsewomen, rangers and shepherds. They are the old nomads’ haunts of the island. Many are smashed and built over some – magically – are still more or less just as they were in centuries long past. They form the hidden Gypsy and Traveller map of the country we live in: they are the bedrock of our reality and, perhaps, the antidote to the unending cycles of romanticisation and demonisation.I had conceived a plan to visit these places, to live in them in my own way, and see what I might learn. Perhaps I might even solve the bizarre contradiction of Britain’s love affair with caravanning, camping and glamping, and its hatred of those who were born to this life, and who largely inspired its adoption as a non-Gypsy pastime. As one Scottish Gypsy Traveller put it: “There are 80,000 members of the Caravan Club, but I’m not allowed to travel?”There is more to this Gypsy geography than a list of physical places. The stopping places themselves are an outgrowth of something non-physical, something that is ancient, unseen yet important, precious and reviled, envied and feared. This thing is the Gypsy belief – the core belief of the culture – that it is possible to live in a different way: in your own way, part of the world, but not imprisoned by the rules. That you can know the ropes and yet not be hemmed in by them. That you can dwell alongside the mainstream, while not being part of it. Otter-like, you can live in the bank of the river and swim and hunt there when you need to, and then climb back out with equal ease and alacrity. There is no better symbol of this belief than the network of atchin tans (stopping places) laced across Britain they are historical, topographical proof that the Gypsy philosophy has existed here, that it still does, that it still can. By staying at the traditional stopping places, I hoped to answer the questions that had been following me, on and off, all my life. What is left of these places? What might we learn from them? What redemption might lie there, in a country that still passes new legislation aimed at ending the Traveller way of life? Is it still possible to live on the road? Was the end of the old Gypsy life a tragedy, or was it a case of good riddance to an irredeemably hard and pitiless life on the edge? Above all, I hoped to resolve the biggest question: the question of myself, whether I could make my peace with Gypsy culture. My conflict seemed to echo the wider tension between nomads and settled people that endures in modern Britain.On the way to our regular pitch selling flowers in the marketplace in Petersfield, my elders would point and nod at empty spaces by the sides of the road, flat areas on verges and slightly raised banks, vacant pull-ins and lay-bys, and make comments as if there was something there, something I couldn’t see. They were glimmers of another world, but it felt as distant as the stars. I knew the places had something to do with the time they were “on the road” – most of my family were settled now, living in houses or caravans and mobile homes on private bits of land.Travellers I knew from the east of England had lived rough deep into the recent past, still working the farms into the 1990s. By then, it had been the best part of 50 years since anyone in my family had depended on that kind of work. So it came as a shock to meet Travellers younger than me who had grown up picking turnips in January. They described reaching down with a gloved hand and grabbing hold of the big, leafy tops, how it would sometimes send a plug of ice shooting upwards.Alongside selling flowers, my family had roofing and car-breaking businesses. We had a big field and a yard, a word that seemed to mean a place where all things might, and did, happen. Terriers, geese and perturbed-looking cockerels roamed in between the legs of cantankerous horses. Stables were stacked full of the musty paraphernalia of horsemanship, flower-selling, roofing and car respraying. Bits of cars lay everywhere, named as if they were the parts or clothes of people or animals: bonnets, boots, seats, wings, belts. There were brass-handled horsewhips, jangling harnesses, buckets of molasses-sprayed chaff and milled sugar-beet, bales of sweet-smelling fresh hay. But all of this old rustic stuff was stacked and wedged in among the hard and greasy gear of the family economy: gas bottles, blowtorches, leaky old engines, spray paint, rolls of lead, felt, and seemingly infinite stacks of every conceivable type of roof tile. A heavy boxing bag swung with barely perceptible creaks, keeping time in the half-light of the dusty old garage.There were caravans there that we sometimes lived in and out of, especially in the summer. We never considered this odd, even though we also had a big house on the land that my grandad had built with his men. And there always seemed to be heavy and dangerous things lying close to hand. The hard stuff of motion was everywhere, although we were settled: cars, tractors and trucks, some brand-new, others eaten by weather and time horses, ponies, traps, sulkies and carts scattered wheels and bolts from Ford and Bedford lorries. And, hung from a barn door like a pair of swords and scabbing to ochre with rust, there were two axles rescued from the ashes of the last wagon owned by our family.We had a name for ourselves: Travellers. In our case, it didn’t just mean anyone who travelled around, regardless of their race: to us it meant our people specifically, the Romanies of Britain. The first Romanies probably arrived on the British mainland towards the end of the 15th century, and had been a contentious presence ever since.Wherever the Gypsies went, they took with them their strange tongue, Romani, and it was through this that the mystery of their origins was solved. An 18th-century German linguist called Johann Rüdiger overheard Gypsies talking, and was struck by the similarity of their speech to Indian languages. Later linguists, including the so-called “Romany Ryes” – rye being the Romani word for a gentleman – such as the English writer George Borrow and the Irish academic John Sampson, would identify layers of borrowings from Persian, Slavic and Romance languages in the Gypsies’ speech, using these to trace a philological map of their long road into the West. English Romani had German-derived words in it, like nixis, meaning “nothing”, and fogel for “smell”.As for the name of the Romanies, it was derived from their own word for “man” or “husband”, rom, and it had nothing to do with Romania, which got its name from the Roman military camps which once filled its territory. The Gypsies called their language Romanes, an adverb meaning “like a rom”. To rokker Romanes meant, simply, to talk like a Gypsy and not like a gorjer – a non-Gypsy. The word gorjies comes from the old Romany word gadje or gadzhe, and though its form has mutated with time, its meaning is the same: the non-Gypsies, outsiders, the people-who-aren’t-us.Almost everyone who has studied Romani in Britain has remarked on how adept its speakers are at coming up with names for things. In some ways, talking Romanes means having to be constantly inventive and alert, both in terms of creating words and also interpreting the new ones that get spun off the cuff and thrown into daily Traveller conversation. There is no stigma attached to inventing words, as there so often is in English nor are new words looked down upon as annoying neologisms that we’d be better off without. Invented words are more likely to be smiled upon or chuckled at as evidence of a witty, intelligent mind one with a good and flexible grasp of the ancient Travellers’ tongue.Besides, if Romani is to retain one of the functions which has kept it alive thus far – and which it has in common with almost all minority languages – namely, to stop outsiders knowing what you are talking about, then it will always be necessary to invent new ways of saying things. According to a Belarusian Romany man I once met, a word is no longer a truly Romani word once its meaning becomes known amongst the gadzhe – it is useless, dead, and best left where it is. This is an extreme opinion, but it points to a common anxiety: that the language will lose its power if it becomes too widely known. Yet words come and go as they please, like mood and temper traded by friends, explained by lovers, and hurled across the fray. Every Gypsy who “gives away” the Romani language risks the accusation of treason.In the old Romany tradition, you can only call yourself a true Romany Gypsy – one of the kaulo ratti, the black blood – if all your ancestors, as far as you know, are of the tribe. I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language to learn the old tales and to keep the Romanipen – the cleanliness taboos of the old-fashioned Gypsies. I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.I have both Gypsy and non-Gypsy blood and so, in many Travellers’ eyes, I do not have the right to call myself a true-bred Romany. It does not matter that there is no such thing as a racially pure Gypsy: over a 1,000-year migration it is virtually impossible that there will have been no mingling in the line. The mixing in my family had happened within living memory, and this meant I was at best a poshrat – a mixed-blood Gypsy – and at worst a “half-chat gorjie” or, as a friend once memorably put it, a “fucked-up half-breed”.I do not look like most people’s idea of a typical Gypsy, my blue eyes and fair hair belying my origins, my picture of myself. My identity was inside me and the outside didn’t match up. It imbued me with a tetchy defensiveness, and a resentment of people whom I then believed had simpler ethnicities: Scottish, Nigerian, Han.I felt so close to my roots, and especially to the Romany women who had brought me up – my mum her mother, Gran and Gran’s mother, Nan. But this seemed to count for little in a world which, for all its modernity, still believed in labels such as “half-caste”, “full-blood” and “mixed race”. Later, as a teenager, I started carrying photographs of darker-haired family members in my wallet, to challenge the disbelief of those who thought I was lying about my Romany background. I lived in a world that wasn’t sure if I really belonged in it, and so I wasn’t sure, either. Regardless, it was where I was. Our family were the mistrusted local Gypsies, the bane of the decent, upstanding parish council. We were “gyppos”, “pikeys”, “diddakois”, “them lot”. Locally, we were infamous. The ide was crystal clear.Compared with the insults and slurs, the words Romanies, Gypsies, and Travellers were dignified, and we used all of them interchangeably. The greater part of our family owned their own yards and bungalows, but the name Travellers still seemed to make sense. There were wheels everywhere, and we were always on hair-trigger alert to hook up trailers and go when the need arose: we drove miles for a living, and had family who lived on the road. Some places with links to the Travellers were not easily romanticised. The sides of the M1, the A1, the A303 and the M25 are peppered with modern-day atchin tans. They are sites with access to opportunities to earn money, and – being less desirable to non-Gypsies – also the sorts of locales where less cash is needed to set up a camp.Such places symbolise the misunderstood truth of many Traveller lives, which is that they are neither permanently nomadic, nor ever truly static. Howbeit, these yards provide a base, the highway is right beside them, ready for the times when family ties, work, a wedding, a funeral, the fair season, beckon. Councils refer to them as “sites close to the key regional transport corridors, favoured by Gypsies and Travellers”. Travellers call them :“Handy, being right by that main road”. Handy, yes, but still handcuffed to tragedy. Every family is haunted by stories of relatives, too often toddlers, who have been knocked down and killed by their literal closeness to roads.The word “Gypsy” wasn’t often heard back when I was a teenager. When it was, it was usually as part of a story about the old days, where someone had shouted out, “Dirty Gypsies!” and nine times out of 10 a fight had ensued, which the dirty Gypsies – who, in my grandad’s words, were “rough, tough and made out of the right stuff” – almost always won.In our world, arguments are often resolved by somebody leaving and the relationship being severed. If this doesn’t happen, then there will almost always be a fight. In the best-case scenario, it’ll just be a fair fist fight, nice and clean, one-on-one, with a referee to see fair play and as few spectators as possible to get sucked into the row. It can be between two men or two women: it’s usually men, but not always. These things are often organised quickly in a place right out of the way, so the law is unlikely to be an issue plus, some police officers I’ve spoken to even seem to have a laissez-faire stance on it, possibly because they have seen worse ways of ending a row than a bare-knuckle fight. Worst-case scenario, it will not be clean and it will not be fair, and the more people that get involved, the more likely that is. If weapons come into it, then the police are especially likely to show an interest.The proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674-1913 are speckled with references to London’s Gypsies and Travellers. There is a website that explains why they were “over-represented in the proceedings”: they formed part of “what many contemporaries considered a dangerous and crime-prone “residuum”’, which seeped back into the city at autumn following the end of the temporary farm work. It goes on, telling how “in a working-class mirror to the elite’s “London Season”, October and November saw hundreds and thousands of men, women and children returning to the capital from hop-picking and market gardening, from touring the fairs and tramping in search of work”. It was a yearly migration from the city to the countryside and back that continued, for some, right up to the 1950s.For all its flighty connotations, Gypsy culture can be stifling in its demands for living in line with its hidden rules. Rock stars employ “Gypsy” to mean those who have escaped from moral claustrophobia, but in reality, Gypsies are just as likely to feel confined as anybody else. In Glasgow, I watched as a troupe of little girls from the local Roma community danced in brightly coloured dresses at a community event. They clicked their fingers on outstretched arms and sang “Ja tuke tuke” to a furious klezmer beat. The audience clapped and twirled, unaware of the lyrics’ meaning: “Get away from me.”Nan talks of the old paradox that we have heard about all of our lives. The hardship of old times, versus the sense of togetherness that Travellers have lost. The gratitude for comforts that not long ago were undreamed of and unheard of, set against the moral corruption, unhappiness and constant malaise that have come from an overfast integration into the gorjies’ consumerist world.For centuries, politicians had guessed that if Gypsies could be settled in regular housing, then within a few short generations they would be just like everyone else. There would be no need for a word for outsiders, because we would be just like them. But that isn’t what has happened. Many Gypsies now live either in housing, or on permanent caravan sites, not in meadows or lanes or lay-bys or by the sides of old tips. And yet they are still what they are, changed in some ways, but different enough to draw the old line between themselves and the gorjies.I sometimes wonder what Nan thinks I am. Of course, I am her great-grandson, born from her line, flesh and blood. But I’m not what she calls a “true Traveller”. Aside from my mixed roots, I wasn’t born to that life: I arrived into a changed era, one of stability, stasis, hot running water, and Christmases stacked with teetering piles of presents. The Romany bloodline never dies out. But the life of the Traveller changes, sometimes so much so that you could forgive the outside world for thinking the people themselves have vanished.When I was small, Horsmonden in Kent was a typical Travellers’ horse fair. This meant that most people weren’t actually there for the horses. It’s true that a core of those who came, mostly men but quite a few women as well, were proper horse people. They came towing their boxes with strong cobs standing inside, tethered in the half-light their two-wheeled sulkies – light trotting carts with a seat big enough for one or two people – and their harness, head collars and whips. But people came from far and near to the fair, and most of them weren’t interested in any equine displays. If they were, then it was simply because they provided an authentic backdrop. What they were interested in depended on the inidual: but mostly, they were interested in each other. It is a quirk of our scatteredness: a few hundred thousand people at most, flecked across Britain’s damp islands, and we meet mostly at weddings, funerals and fairs. The horse trade has its ups and downs – as I write this, it’s down, the worst in my lifetime. But the horse fairs will persist, because their purpose goes beyond trade.When the days are hot and tanned skins gleam with sweat in the sun, it is clear once again that horse fairs are shop windows for young brides and husbands. They always have been. This much, at least, is gospel, and proudly announced to journalists and inquisitive souls who come asking questions about the culture. But not every dalliance ends in a marriage, and rumours occasionally flare of unauthorised, ultra-brief flings at the fringes of fairs: dangerous liaisons that lead to bad names, fights, or worse, feuds that run on and on.For the not so young, what they seek from each other is something subtler, less clear to outsiders, but an equally powerful draw. I suspect few would want to explain what it was, for fear of sapping its power by giving it voice. What the fairs offer is a chance to track the progress of our lives: to reminisce about previous years when we trod the same field, but equally to remark on how far we have come.We polish and dress up our lives for the day and compare them to the lives of others, affirming their context, confirming their meaning. The fairs are where we remind ourselves who we are. It’s not that we don’t keep being who we are in between – of course we do. But the fairs provide a special concentration of Traveller experience, a tincture of what it is to be a Gypsy. At a horse fair we get to see, just for one day, what life would be like if the world shared our Gypsy priorities.And then there are those who despise both horses and the fairs. For some families, the horse had its day a long time ago. I once asked my mate Charles if he and his family used to go to the fairs up north, which is where he comes from. He looked at me as though the question was perverse. “We don’t mind a day at the races, but Damian, can you see me or me dad, or any of us here, fucking about with horses? My great-great-grandad was a proper Gypsy man, and he was driving a Rolls-Royce a hundred year ago.”Traveller culture, preoccupied though it can be with bygone times, has always preferred the tangible: today’s bread, the here and the now. As Nan says, “You can only eat one meal at a time.” In the past, writers took this as evidence that Gypsies inhabited a “heroic present”, lacking a sense of history and living so sharply in the moment that concepts such as deferred gratification were lost on them. I have always dismissed such ideas as inherently dangerous: they are liable to slide into essentialism, and the belief that races have irreconcilable differences. But maybe in turning so sharply away from a lie, I lost sight of a truth: that the present holds a finer promise than the past with its shadows and dust. In an inversion of the obvious, perhaps even the Traveller obsession with cemetery maintenance itself supports this view. After all, isn’t the act of placing flowers on a tomb a gesture of bringing a little life back to the dead?After the fair at Horsmonden, I largely avoided gatherings of people, spending time in empty stopping places, visiting forlorn churches and well-kept graves. It is dawning on me that there is only so much I can learn from this. Another of Nan’s catchphrases comes to me: “There are no pockets in shrouds.” Perhaps this saying, a caution against overzealous pursuit of riches, masks a second meaning as well. There is a poverty to death a limit to how much a skeleton can teach you about a life it no longer knows.I realised how sparsely furnished my van was. Its naked pale blue surfaces stared at me like sheets of ice. For eight months, I had been travelling with what I thought were the bare essentials – bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick: the means by which a difficult life was rendered livable and even, at times, enviable.When I asked Mum for help, she looked happy, as if pleased that I’d finally grasped the meaning of life. She gave me armfuls of folded materials. There was an Islamic purple velvet hanging, edged with golden stitching and arranged in a pattern of teardrops matching Bedouin horse-cloths, constructed out of navy blue and orange-coloured diamond shapes of fabric brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths: two square ones, and one in the shape of an arch. They shouted in bright yellows and blues and greens and pinks, with tiny mirrors stitched into them alongside little embroidered birds, stars, flowers, chakra wheels and Hindu swastikas. I decorated the van, clipping the cloths to the plywood lining with bulldog clips and larger, stronger, rubber-tipped market grips.The van was completely transformed. Its contents came together into a nomadic aesthetic all of its own ramshackle, yet somehow making happy sense as a whole. My gran and grandad – Mum’s parents – wandered over to see what I’d been doing. They seemed stunned, but in a good way: “Looks like an old vardo,” Grandad said, using the Traveller word for caravan. Gran remarked that the way I had hung the cloths reminded her of the inside of the Travellers’ square tents back when she was a little girl. Their approval came as a relief. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 7 June.

At the stroke of midnight here, on the evening of 29 March 2019, one of those fluttering flags will be lowered. My view of Jean-Claude Juncker’s hideous Berlaymont building will be a little less cluttered, and Britain will no longer be a member of the European Union.I arrived in Brussels nearly 18 months ago as the newspaper’s bureau chief, from where I’ve had the mixed blessing of watching close up the twists, turns and positively cringeworthy contortions on display in the Brexit talks. Whether an arch-Remoaner or a fervent hardline Brexiter, most followers of the process would agree that the UK’s extraction from Brussels is proving to be a singularly painful exercise. It is akin to a high-stakes poker game in which one player is always bluffing, is well known to be doing so, and is therefore, rather unsurprisingly, repeatedly exposed.The process is unlikely to become any more comfortable for the UK as we approach the formal withdrawal date, before entering and leaving a 21-month (or longer!) period of transition as a rule-taker, and then launching into a potentially endless argument, debate and deliberation about whether it was all worth it, and what to do now with our hard-fought freedom and global reach. If some in the Conservative party think that leaving the EU will put an end to its own internal agony over Britain’s place in Europe, I fear they will be deeply disappointed. As some people say in Switzerland, negotiations with the EU, once started, never truly come to an end.There is a lot of talk today about May’s lack of foresight in triggering those talks without having prepared a plan for the future. At the time, though, there was simply a lot of griping that it was taking so long to put in the letter and get the thing going. Nine months had passed before Sir Tim Barrow, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, handed it to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, during which time the EU had refused to talk with Whitehall about Brexit, beyond a few logistical discussions. It was clear from there that these talks were going to be on the EU’s terms.So the great letter-giving was the point at which the proper talks, and reporting on them, could get going? No. Far from it. The prime minister, in her wisdom, called a general election a few weeks later.That announcement was certainly a shock in Britain, but in Brussels, it was welcome. Juncker, the president of the European commission, had even taken time out to privately lobby May in favour of calling it. For all of May’s election-campaign talk about Brussels loving the idea of a weak prime minister to exploit, in reality they wanted a strong one who could face down the Brexiters. Democratically enhanced, she could be open with the British public about the trade-offs and compromises that would be required. At the time the greatest fear in Brussels was that the orce bill (initially resisted, later settled at £39bn) would be used by some in the party to push the UK to walk out of the negotiations, prompting the hardest of all Brexits.Of course, once again neither May nor Brussels got what they wanted from the British voting public. But neither, it turns out, has it been the orce bill that has injected the greatest drama and danger into the talks. Of all the surprise bumps in the road, from the general election to the bizarre moment when it emerged that Spain intended to use the Brexit talks to progress their centuries-old ambitions over Gibraltar, the one that could still upend the whole thing is the issue of avoiding a border on the island of Ireland.It is this issue that encapsulates the central problem of Brexit. In leaving the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, Britain has sealed its fate: there will have to be border checks between it and the club. If a border is to be avoided on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland is in effect going to have to remain part of that club.That might seem dogmatic and unreasonable to some in the UK. And there is a danger, certainly, of a correspondent from the  in Brussels going native, given the paper’s editorial line and its doubts over the sagacity of the Johnsons and Goves of this world. But the EU kindly vaccinates against that. It isn’t so attractive a thing, close up, either. A startlingly white organisation, last year the European commission launched a ersity drive to recruit “women, staff with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex (LGBTI) staff and older staff”, yet a spokesman was surprised, even indignant, when I asked why there was no mention of ethnic minority groups. Its decision to pay Turkey, and fund the Libyan coastguard, to keep refugees from crossing its border is full of moral hazard. The pandering to Viktor Orbán, the populist, anti-Islamic prime minister of Hungary – who is a member of the same pan-European political grouping as Juncker, Tusk and the German chancellor Angela Merkel – is pretty nauseating. The European parliament is full of showboaters, idle expense-spongers and a fair share of cranks. Meanwhile the commission’s handling of Britain’s negotiation requests can be rough to the point of outrageously rude, sometimes even self-defeating, with a smug smile never too far from some of the senior officials’ faces. After all, the UK’s humiliation has been a real career-enhancer for some. But perhaps it is only after sitting with EU officials and hearing them talk in lovingly protective terms about the “normative order” of the EU – the institutional and legal architecture that gives each of the member states the necessary trust in each other to keep on going – that one can understand quite how limited are the choices on both sides. You hear often from diplomats and officials that the talks aren’t a matter of punishing Britain. That is true, to a point. But what these talks certainly are about is not allowing the UK to disrupt a complex and evidently fragile architecture that has just about kept the peace between nations that do not have a great record in peacekeeping.When you are inside the club, you can play around with the rules a bit. Outside, the rulebook plays around with you. One of my most enjoyable articles to write while here was a piece comparing and contrasting today’s farce with Britain’s failed 1961-63 accession talks, which in the end were stopped short by General de Gaulle’s “non”. A 28-page account penned by the UK delegation – marked “secret” – had warned the prime minister Harold Macmillan that their counterparts had “insisted that our position was that of the demandeur” and the “existing rules must in principle be regarded as sacrosanct”. A better deal than that offered to members was not on the cards. It would, the UK officials subsequently complained to their political masters, “have been helpful if we could have formed a clearer view as to what would be negotiable” rather than put forward “proposals … which in the event proved quite unnegotiable”. It took a decade for Britain to rethink its approach, swallow it all, and join the club in 1973. To misquote Mark Twain: “There is no such thing as a new story”. Perhaps I’ll watch that 28th flag go back up again in a decade’s time too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcf3e60fc8ca5e6f470be9a7061cc175021f50e/0_106_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb2b314550564328daa1c084a5c108b8","title":"michel barnier rejects may uk wide brexit backstop plan","story":"EU negotiator warns Britain checks will be needed on goods travelling across Irish SeaMichel Barnier has warned that Theresa May’s backstop solution to avoid a border on the island of Ireland raises “more questions than answers” as he ruled out the whole of the UK staying in the customs union and key parts of the single market after Brexit.“Backstop means backstop,” the EU’s chief negotiator told a press conference in Brussels, as he insisted the UK needed to be pragmatic and accept that Northern Ireland would have to be treated differently to the rest of the country, with checks taking place on goods travelling across the Irish Sea.The backstop plan is set to snap into effect should a free trade deal or technological solution not be in place by the end of the transition period to prevent the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EU has suggested that Northern Ireland effectively stay in the customs union and adhere to large parts of the single market rules in such a scenario, a proposal flatly rejected by Downing Street as it would create a border within the UK.Barnier said the EU was willing to consider the prime minister’s suggestion – made in a document published on Thursday – that the UK stay in the customs union after the transition period to avoid some checks, although he said it could not be a “time limited” arrangement. But he would not countenance the UK staying in parts of the single market, as that would be cherry-picking access.The UK has yet to say what it would do with regard to avoiding the border checks necessary on goods travelling in and out of the single market.Barnier said, however, that there could be no suggestion of the UK as a whole taking advantage of the offer made for Northern Ireland to stay in regulatory alignment and therefore avoid the need for checks on goods travelling to and from the EU.He detected, he said, a sense of of nostalgia among some British negotiators for the privileges of EU membership, but the bloc had been clear that it was not willing to grant “à la carte” single market access.“Sometimes I sense in those proposals some sort of nostalgia at the moment of leaving the European Union, since you want to stay everywhere without ever again respecting the regulatory framework,” Barnier said, saying UK ministers including Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, had put forward “all sorts of proposals that surprise us, that appear paradoxical.”“We respect Britain’s red lines. I’d wish the British would respect their own red lines too.”He added: “Let me be clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland ... Let’s go back to pragmatism.” On Thursday, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who had at one point appeared on the brink of resignation, convinced May to include an expected timeframe for the backstop of December 2021.Barnier, however, was withering about such a concept. “The time-limited term does not work for us,” he said.No 10 immediately hit back at Barnier’s rejection of a UK-wide backstop, saying May “has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.The spokesman added: “That position will not change. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.”Downing Street suggested Barnier’s comments were still up for debate. “All parties must recall their commitment in the joint report to protect the Belfast agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal,” the spokesman said.The Democratic Unionist party MP Nigel Dodds said: “Michel Barnier’s latest comments demonstrate he has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland. We will not accept such a proposal.”In response to Johnson, who had suggested in leaked comments that a “meltdown” in the talks was coming and that the UK could benefit from the assertive negotiating style of Donald Trump, Barnier said: “I always listen very attentively to what he says and it is always very stimulating. But I am not going to comment on that.” Barnier said he would not be intimidated by UK politicians. “If we want to build a new relationship, we need a base of trust, we also need more realism about what is and what will be possible and what is not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122f4622dbb95866958248e16afacee5903e2a29/0_85_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11928d92a30ee7d97394218ad5393e9","title":"snp delegates rebuke ministers with vote for state run financing","story":"Party’s spring conference overwhelmingly supports call to replace private schemesScottish National party delegates have voted heavily to replace privately financed schemes with a state-run infrastructure agency, in an implied rebuke to SNP ministers.The party’s spring conference overwhelmingly supported calls for Scottish ministers to set up a publicly funded infrastructure agency after the  disclosed new evidence that firms in offshore tax havens invest heavily in Scottish government-sponsored building projects.Research for the  and the Ferret website found offshore firms stand to earn more than £1.7bn from contracts to build and run 47 new hospitals, motorway upgrades, schools, health centres and colleges overseen by an agency set up by the SNP government, the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT). The SFT uses a less costly form of private financing than previous methods, but Scottish government data shows those 47 schemes will cost £2.7bn to build. Once their financing and maintenance costs are included, the total bill will rise to £8bn over the next 30 years.Scottish taxpayers have still to pay off about £20bn from earlier and more costly private finance initiative schemes initiated in the 1990s by the Conservatives, and then used heavily by Labour, and in some part by the SNP.Anne McLaughlin, a former MSP, told the party conference that the public infrastructure company suggested by the pro-Scottish independence CommonWeal thinktank would be “democratically accountable”. It would keep these building projects “in the public sector for the public good”, she said.In a further vote, the conference also urged public sector pension funds to invest in a proposed new Scottish investment bank being set up by ministers in Edinburgh which focused on ethical projects and “the public good”. also revealed that public sector pension funds run by 14 English and Scottish councils, and one for the Environment Agency, have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in SFT projects that are controlled by offshore companies.Dave Watson, head of policy for the public sector union Unison Scotland and an expert in pensions, said ministers could already insist that public pension funds sign up to the “fair tax mark” which prevented them from investing in tax avoidance schemes.“It is simply wrong that public money and our members pension contributions should be invested in tax avoidance mechanisms. Billions of pounds of revenue are lost every year that could have been invested in vital public services,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bf192e697b92251a929c2047030fa67011751c/0_312_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c4a9e77f01f74b9ef37624dbb08c5b","title":"ageism widespread in uk study finds","story":"Ageism is rife in Britain, with millennials holding the most negative attitudes towards ageing, according to a study. Across all age groups, almost a third of people surveyed agreed with the statement “being lonely is just something that happens when people get old”, while two-thirds said they had no friends with an age gap of 30 years or more.“Ageist attitudes abound in society and have a major impact on the public’s health, and yet they are rarely treated with the seriousness they deserve,” said the RSPH chief executive, Shirley Cramer.“Too often ageist behaviour and language is trivialised, overlooked or even served up as the punchline to a joke – something we would rightly not tolerate with other forms of prejudice.”The study also found that half of women and a quarter of men said they felt pressure to stay looking young. The society called for a ban on use of the term “anti-ageing” in the cosmetics and beauty industry. “If we can begin to remove the stubborn barriers that reinforce societal ageism, we can expect many more to look forward to later life as a period of opportunity for growth and new experiences, rather than a set of mental and physical challenges,” Cramer said. In partnership with the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the study surveyed ageist attitudes across 12 areas of life, revealing that the public are most ageist about appearance, memory loss and participation in physical and community activities. According to the RSPH, negative attitudes about ageing can become “a self-fulfilling prophecy”, with previous research showing that those with such attitudes live seven and a half years less on average, experience increased memory loss, have a greater risk of depression and anxiety, a reduced ability to recover from illness, less interest in diet and exercise and a more negative body image.  The RSPH called for the Independent Press Standards Organisation to include age in the editors’ code of practice to prevent discrimination. The report recommends housing nurseries and care homes under the same roof. “Intergenerational contact and care offer huge benefits for the groups involved, but also to the facilities’ operators,” it says, adding that it could be an opportunity for local authorities and private providers to save costs “as well as offering genuine wellbeing benefits to ‘young’ and ‘old’ customers alike”.

An 18-year-old student from China has become one of the first residents to move into Centre Point, the 1960s brutalist office tower that has undergone a multimillion-pound conversion into one of the world’s most luxurious apartment buildings.The student, who will begin her studies at UCL in September, has been handed the keys to a two-bedroom flat with panoramic views from the bedroom – and even the shower – stretching from the Royal Albert Hall to Wembley Stadium. The 117 sq metre apartment, designed by Conrad and Partners, set her parents back just under £5m. While the student’s apartment is undeniably luxurious, it is positively bijou compared to the £55m penthouse at the top of the block. That two-storey apartment features five ensuite bathrooms and a wraparound terrace with a vista across the whole of London taking in St Paul’s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and beyond to Surrey Hills on a good day.There are no affordable flats included in the tower, which was designed by Richard Seiffert. The cheapest 70-sq-metre, one-bed flat in the 82-apartment tower is on the market for just over £1.8m.Instead, the developer built 13 affordable socially rented flats in a separate low-rise tower, which has already been dubbed Centre Point’s “poor house” in reference to the 2014 scandal, which revealed that residents of affordable units in several luxury developments were forced to use different entrances to the wealthy private residents.Under planning rules the development should have included 41 affordable flats, but the developer instead handed Camden Council £6m towards the creation of a new square behind the tower and public transport improvements. Camden councillor Danny Beales said the council sought to “maximise the delivery of genuinely affordable housing through the planning process and has adopted some of the most stringent policies in the country”. “We are, however, required by national law, in making planning decisions, to take account of other material considerations and that includes the viability of schemes,” Beales, Camden’s cabinet member for investing in communities, said. “Where applications are submitted to us with a below-policy affordable housing requirement, the viability is robustly and independently tested.Rough sleepers once congregated in the space beneath the tower, which had its lobby above the ground when it was an office block and head office of the Confederation of British Industry. That space is now a lobby and concierge area complete with bowler-hat wearing doormen. Homelessness charity Centrepoint is named after the tower. The communal facilities are also slightly better than the average hall of residence. The residents have access to a 30-metre swimming pool that stretches the length of the building and offers views of Oxford Street, as well as a gym, sauna, spa and private cinema. The tenants of the affordable flats do not have access to any facilities. If the student gets a bit peckish in the evening and doesn’t want to cook she will be able to order from the restaurants on the ground including a new “concept restaurant” from the creators of Sushisamba. Giving the  a tour of the building this week, Daniel Ritterband, Almacantar’s communications director, joked that he was considering entering the building for “the best student accommodation awards”.Hersel said she was confident the duplex penthouse would “sell itself” despite a £55m asking price. “There are plenty of people in the world who could afford it,” she said. “There is nothing else like this, with such history, location and views.” She added that two potential buyers had already been on tours of the penthouse, which will not be completed until September, despite the company making no effort to market it. The rooftop terrace, which was previously the popular Paramount bar, will feature lit-up replicas of the building’s letters.None of the apartments come with free parking, but 17 spots are available in the basement for an additional £250,000 each. Hersel said she hoped to exploit the building’s connection to fashion and the arts to attract buyers from across the world. The company is in talks with the British Fashion Council about hosting London Fashion Week events at the tower, and Vogue about using the penthouse for a fashion shoot. Discussions are also believed to be under way with the director and producers of the 25th James Bond film about including the building in the film, which will be released next year. Suggested scenarios are understood to include having Bond land on the roof via parachute or helicopter.Just over half the building’s 82 apartments have so far been sold and 10 owners have moved in. The first full-time residents were two City lawyers who were so keen to own a slice of the 1966 tower that they approached Hersel to be put on the waiting list before planning permission was granted. “They just really love this building, and wanted to live here so much,” Hersel said.

Thiem has beaten him twice on clay in the past 13 months, most recently in Madrid last month and, if there is to be a shock to top Cecchinato’s defeat of Djokovic in the quarter-finals, he has a fighting\u0026nbspchance.Nadal took two and a quarter hours to win 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 against Del Potro. But the snap had clearly drained from Del Potro’s wrists – which have endured multiple surgeries – and the Argentinian’s last shot sailed clear of the baseline by a good foot. He looked woebegone and immensely relieved.Nadal said: “If you lose, you lose. But I’m going to play with my highest passion, my love for the sport. I have a lot of injuries and I know the years are going quick. I love the competition, I love the sport. If it was not that way, I would not be here.“It was a good second and third set for me. Sunday is the day to give my best, increase even a little bit more the level. In the first set, he was serving big. Every time I served, I was having problems. I gave him too many chances. If I don’t play well against Dominic, it’s almost impossible. He will be a big challenge. I believe I can have my chances.”Thiem, the bustling Austrian regarded second only to Nadal on clay, must take the confidence of his successes against the world No\u0026nbsp1 into the final to stop his opponent turning these championships into a personal benevolent fund. In winning 10 titles since 2005, Nadal has taken away nearly $17m (£12.7m) in prize money, a fifth of his career earnings. That could grow by €2.2m (£1.9m) on Sunday – or a not inconsiderable €1.12m (£980,000) for second place.For Thiem, this is more than a numbers game, though. It is an assault on his self-belief, and he sounds mentally rock solid, even if his legs may be telling him a different story.Beyond argument, Thiem had the tougher Friday. It was a curious affair, though – for reasons that had little to do with the match itself. It was impossible to tell if it was the weight of the moment or the loose-hanging threads of his past that most discomforted Cecchinato. For long stretches of the two hours and 17 minutes it took Thiem to eke out the victory, the first semi-final was loaded with unspoken darkness.The odds on an exonerated match-fixer reaching the final of a grand slam might normally be a million to one. Yet, for nearly two hours, Cecchinato, the 25-year-old Italian, played his third heroic match of the tournament to push logic to its limit.Two years ago he beat an 18-month suspension and a €40,000 fine for his part in a 2015 match-fixing scandal in Morocco on a technicality. On day 13 of the championships – his lucky number, as it happens – that dagger hung over tennis until Thiem cut him down in the afternoon sun.The affable loser would not talk about it earlier in the tournament, and he was allowed the grace of not having to after a spirited fighting exit. Pity drowned moralism, for once. But his story has been as embarrassing for the game as it has for the player. Nobody saw any of this coming when Cecchinato’s name appeared in the draw. Nor did many alarm bells ring when he escaped from the first round in a tense five-setter against the unseeded Romanian Marius Copil. Then, with a boom that echoed around the game, he dumped Djokovic out of the tournament, and found himself staring out from centre stage.Playing more freely after surviving two tough sets, Thiem raced to the finish. With the improbable quickly curdling into the impossible, Cecchinato’s happy head dropped and his legs dragged.Perhaps it was the same sort of resignation that had consumed him the day in Morocco three years ago when he lost in straight sets to the world No\u0026nbsp338, Kamil Majchrzak, at odds of 7-1, gratefully snapped up by a friend. Or maybe not.Cecchinato does not want to talk about that. A lot of people do not. The Tennis Integrity Unit would only say in reply to the  on Friday: “In line with TIU confidentiality policy, we are not making any comment on Cecchinato.”Many in the crowd shouted “Marco! Marco!” as he departed, banging his right fist on his heart and soaking up more adulation than he can have had in all eight years as a pro. He leaves Paris headed for Eastbourne and Wimbledon €560,000 richer than when he arrived. And he did try his heart out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b58c7301b75874a0fa6a2b0bcd4984010f47cbc/1_4_3017_1810/master/3017.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215424b1533fa02fe09fe98cc85c0d61","title":"doug stanhope review brixton academy","story":"Brixton Academy, LondonOne of the sharpest minds and loosest cannons in comedy is back with material about rape, race and #MeToo“Is it wrong to use racism to try and stop gang rape?”American standup Doug Stanhope is back in the UK and, yes, that sound you can hear is sacred cows bellowing.

First, Stanhope – jaded as ever – recites the public apology he anticipates having to issue after the show. Then he ventures a comparison between comedians and magicians, the former infinitesimally less fraudulent than the latter. At once romantic and cynical, it’s an exemplary Stanhope joke – and this is just housekeeping before the gig proper. There follows a precis of his world-tour experiences so far, featuring wisecracks about Vietnamese currency (“Can’t we just make it a dong ninety-nine?”) and a gloriously childish riff on the law against insulting the Thai king.The two most eyecatching routines concern gang rape in India and Stanhope’s take on #MeToo. In both, he takes up highly provocative positions, then brings arguments into play to see if these stances can be defended. Some audiences may never get over their initial distaste. For others there is a certain appalled pleasure to be had at Stanhope’s devilry, bloody-mindedness and scorn for piety and groupthink wherever he finds them.He paints a dismal portrait of his own life haunting airport hotels, guzzling pizza before booze “the same way they stack sandbags before a flood”. One skit about his disgust at old people tips into ugliness for its own sake. His section on children’s deaths isn’t much fun either. And yet, making fun, insists Stanhope in a broadside against humourlessness, is all we’ve got: our only defence against life’s brutality. He wields it well tonight – more often than not.•Doug Stanhope is at the O2 Academy, Glasgow, 8 June. Box office: 0141-332 2232. Then touring.

Goldman’s screenwriting credits include Kick-Ass and Kingsman: The Secret Service.The series will be set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones and “will chronicle the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour”. HBO has released the following logline: “Only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend … it’s not the story we think we know.”Martin had already revealed that any HBO spin-offs would be prequels but the news acts as confirmation of the first of a number of potential new shows set in the same universe. Last May, the network hired a number of writers to work on them, including Goldman herself and Brian Helgeland, who wrote the screenplay for LA Confidential.Last year, Goldman hinted that her series will include humor and gore. “Those are things I love, and things I like to do,” shetold Digital Spy. “It would be remiss of me not to put them in.”HBO’s progamming president, Casey Bloys, has teased that there will be between “zero to five” spin-off projects that make it to the small screen. He also revealed that the first show will not air until at least a year after the main show ends.The final season will air in 2019 with Bloys referring to it as “six one-hour movies”. He told Entertainment Weekly: “The show has proven that TV is every bit as impressive and in many cases more so, than film. What they’re doing is monumental.”Star Emilia Clarke recently revealed that she has already shot her final scene as Daenerys Targaryen. “It fucked me up,” she told Vanity Fair. “Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone’s mouth of what Daenerys is …”In April, Martin also revealed that he will be publishing an “imaginary history” of the Targaryen family in November.

It has also become a successful export, with the format sold to countries including Germany, Australia and Finland.Mike Beale, of ITV Studios, which makes the programme, said he was delighted the programme was “winning a Bafta and breaking viewing records in the UK” and said the international sales meant a version of the show would be on air “somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas”.Originally launched as Celebrity Love Island in the mid-2000s, the show was rebooted without the celebrity element in 2015, slowly building an audience through word-of-mouth.The programme involves a group of twentysomethings sitting around a Spanish villa, being constantly filmed Big Brother-style while ostensibly trying to find their true love.At the start of the series the men and women couple up, before spending the following eight weeks going on dates, and trying to avoid being dumped or voted off the island by viewers at home. New contestants are regularly introduced and the pair crowned the hottest couple at the end of the series receive £50,000. However, the real prize for many on the show is becoming famous enough to gain millions of Instagram followers and a chance to spin their newfound popularity into a career as a D-list celebrity influencer. This year’s contestants include Dani Dyer, the daughter of the actor Danny Dyer, and Alex George, a doctor who has already faced criticism for taking leave from the NHS to appear on the show. The show’s success is also winning over unlikely fans. The former chancellor George Osborne ruled himself out of the running for the Daily Mail editorship by tweeting that he was too busy watching the programme.Meanwhile, Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said members of the Labour parliamentary party were addicted. “Me and Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy have got a WhatsApp group where we have a nightly debrief where we’ll agree who or what we’re going to vote for,” she said.“There’s nothing better than a bit of trash TV to forget about the other very awful issues we have to deal with, and get absorbed in the inter-relations and interactions of other people.” During the last series, Powell ended up running a whipping operation within parliament to ensure the right candidates won. “I did quite a lot of cajoling and made sure people voted in things.”The show is also attracting academic attention. Alex Teytelboym, a University of Oxford economics lecturer, has analysed the programme’s complex dynamics.“Everything was calm when there were just five boys and five girls on the island. Then Adam joined and the boys freaked out. That’s exactly what economic theory would predict: increasing competition on one side of the market – say, the boys – makes everyone on that side compete harder and end up with worse matches.”He hoped viewers hooked on the show’s complex social dynamics would use it as an opportunity to understand game theory.“You might think that when you’ve got all the bargaining power, you should pick your favourite partner, but that would be foolish because you’d be sending a signal to everyone else that you are not to be trusted. This is what a ‘folk theorem’ economic theory suggests: patience and commitment can make you and your partner much better off in the long run even if you’re constantly facing incentives to cheat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1777dd2120581e495001411bf4033db14e17e1be/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5b522f0f8558022f5929010e5a026ea","title":"cynthia nixon new york governor","story":"Fueled by small donors, the Sex and the City star spells out her challenge to Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic establishmentby  Ed Pilkington in BuffaloCynthia Nixon will not make the same mistake twice. As the former Sex and the City star arrived for a campaign event in Buffalo, New York this week she was greeted by a phalanx of placard-wielding supporters of her opponent, the incumbent governor of the state, Andrew Cuomo.“Cynthia go home,” one poster said, which was a bit rough given the almost 400-mile journey she’d just made from her home in New York City. “This is upstate – nice of you to find it,” said a snarky second. Another said: “Next stop Ithica.”“Very unfortunate,” Nixon conceded as she was quizzed about the gaffe at the event in Buffalo. And for good measure she correctly enunciated every letter: “B.U.F.F.A.L.O.”Hiccups are perhaps only to be expected for a first-time candidate who cut her teeth on the stage, found fame through the small screen and has never before run for elected office. But what is most surprising about Cynthia Nixon’s audacious attempt to unseat Cuomo from the governorship he has occupied for the past eight years is how surefooted it feels.Nixon is positioning herself boldly as the true progressive voice for New York. She calls her campaign a “people-powered insurgency”, fueled by small donors in contrast to Cuomo’s top-down bid for re-election with its $30m war chest, and her rhetoric is as targeted as much against the machine politics of New York’s dominant Democratic party as it is against Donald Trump. She has cut his polling lead from 47 points in March to 22 last month.“We have a governor here in Andrew Cuomo who is not a progressive and is barely a Democrat,” Nixon told the  in Buffalo, New York state’s second largest city. “If he wanted true progressive change he would have done it already – you can’t just play progressive in the months leading up to an election.”If this sounds familiar, it is: Nixon channels more than a little of Bernie Sanders. As a framing for the Nixon versus Cuomo battle, think Sanders versus Hillary Clinton – the radical outlier versus the establishment favourite. She puts it another way: David versus Goliath.Unlike Sanders, who ran before Trump was ascendant, Nixon has the benefit of the post-Trump bounce that is lifting her up as part of a nationwide resistance. “With Donald Trump in the White House we are going in completely the wrong direction,” she told the . “This is a terrible moment for our country, but it is also an opportunity: we are incentivized as never before in my lifetime to make progressive change.”As a further boost, she sees her campaign as part of a related nationwide surge of radical female candidates who are shaking up the Democratic party – most recently in the figure of Stacey Abrams who is vying in Georgia to become America’s first black female governor. “Trump has been a wake-up call for women all across the country who believe, as I believe, that if we want change we have to go out and make it happen ourselves by running for office,” Nixon said.One of the interesting aspects of Nixon’s bid to become New York’s first female governor is her relationship to her own celebrity. She studiously avoids all reference to it – you will hear no mention of SATC in her campaign literature or in her stump speeches.But being a household name is an undeniable advantage in modern politics – not every rookie candidate is given a platform on The Daily Show or endorsed by the Nation – and though she doesn’t labour the point, nor does she run from it. When the  caught up with her at a campaign stop on the New York City subway, where she was berating Cuomo for the diabolical state of mass transit in the metropolis over which he presides, she smiled broadly and shook the hands of passengers who were palpably star-struck in her presence.“I love you!” several riders said, stopping to take selfies with her. But an equal number were complimentary not towards Nixon as Miranda but towards Nixon as would-be governor. “I really like what you’re saying about the subway,” a male passenger said. “I’m a teacher and I’m really appreciative of what you’re trying to do for us,” a woman said.That delicate balance of making the most of her fame without playing to it is more complicated in upstate New York, where voters have a more skeptical approach towards stardom. Though they share the same identity as New Yorkers, the 9 million residents of New York City and the 11 million residents of the rest of the state are in some ways chalk and cheese: voters in economically struggling upstate and western regions of New York state view the city dwellers as “flatlanders” and can scoff at their fashion trends and perceived glamour.“That show, it did a lot to harm family values in this country,” said a man in Buffalo who asked not to be named, referring to Sex and the City.As Nixon builds her campaign ahead of the Democratic primary election against Cuomo in September she is counting on the likelihood that most voters who bother to turn up – whether in the city or in upstate communities like Buffalo – will be committed progressives who will be receptive to her left-leaning pitch. And she believes that her long record of voluntary work, especially as an advocate for public schools, will speak louder than any of Cuomo’s attacks on her for being unqualified or lightweight.“Cynthia is a very down-to-earth, accessible person who really understands people. She connects to people, then links that to policy and what needs to happen,” said Billy Easton, who worked closely with her at the Alliance for Quality Education where he is executive director.In Buffalo she certainly talked the liberal talk as she addressed an art gallery full of activists. During two hours of discussion with about 50 local people she ticked off all the subjects dearest to American progressives’ hearts. As governor she would: address racial and economic inequality and empower people in their communities increase taxes on the super-wealthy to pay for it decriminalize marijuana possession as one of many steps towards emptying out prisons extend rights for undocumented immigrants increase protections for LGBTQ people invest in public education toughen rent laws and combat gentrification fight corruption and end the overweening influence of corporate money in politics.The list may verge on the predictable, but long before she gets to the polling stations it is already having an impact. A discernible pattern has emerged – dubbed the “Cynthia effect” by pundits – whereby she proposes a new leftist policy one day and Cuomo responds with his own version of it the next. You see that with marijuana, where the sitting governor resolutely opposed legalisation until Nixon launched her campaign and then within weeks switched to supporting it. He passively accommodated the bizarre situation whereby seven Democratic state senators side with the Republicans, maintaining a conservative grip on state government, until Nixon declared her run – and then he moved swiftly to reunite the party. He opposed giving the right to vote to 40,000 people with criminal convictions, then did a U-turn once Nixon was in the race.Cuomo’s kneejerk reactions to Nixon’s goading should not be confused with political weakness – the wily and cunning incumbent is very far from conceding defeat. But the responses do suggest signs that we now have game on.And as Nixon stresses, she’s not in this contest just for the “Cynthia effect”. She’s here for one reason alone: “I’m in this to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e412cbcb14b5f21328b0adc1fd4e9cda2ff025/200_0_2477_1486/master/2477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9798e493b0940d2bddcfdc336d2a6d71","title":"turkey austria close mosques expel imams","story":"Austrian chancellor says country can no longer put up with ‘parallel societies’As many as 60 Turkish imams and their families face expulsion from Austria and seven mosques are due to be closed under a clampdown on what the government has called “political Islam”.Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said the country could no longer put up with “parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation,” which he said had “no place in our country”.The announcement at a press conference by leading members of the coalition government, which comprises the centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ), prompted a furious reaction from Ankara, which called the move anti-Islamic.“Austria’s decision to shut down numerous mosques and deport imams with a lame excuse is a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist wave in this country,” tweeted İbrahim Kalin, a spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Austria’s interior minister, Herbert Kickl, of the FPÖ, said around 150 people faced losing their right to residency, taking into account the imams’ family members.The moves follow an investigation by the national religious affairs authority into activities carried out by mosques in Austria. Images of children in a Turkish-financed mosque re-enacting the first world war battle of Gallipoli have dominated headlines in Austria for weeks, and intensified a nationwide debate over what is widely viewed as the insufficient integration of people of Turkish origin in Austrian society.The photographs, published in April, showed some of the boys playing dead and being draped in Turkish flags – seeming to identify more with Turkey than with Austria – at what was reportedly an official event organised by the Turkish-Islamic Cultural Association (ATIB). The ATIB condemned the images, calling the event “extremely regrettable”, but insisting that it had called it off.Relations between Austria and Turkey have long been strained, with Kurz insistent to the European Union since he entered office last year that it should cease negotiations about Ankara joining the bloc.At the press conference on Friday, Kurz, Kickl, the vice-chancellor, Christian Strache, and the culture minister, Gernot Blümel, said the country had an obligation to be “watchful” of political Islam. The initiative is part of the so-called Islam law, which was brought in under the previous government, in which Kurz was a minister.Among the mosques facing closure is the Mosque of the Grey Wolves on Antonsplatz, in the working-class Vienna district of Favoriten, where the Gallipoli reenactment took place. The Grey Wolves are widely considered to be a far-right ultranationalist group. The other six mosques are in Vienna, Upper Austria and Carinthia, in all of which hardline salafist teachings are said to be widespread. The imams facing expulsion all stand accused of receiving funding from abroad. Official investigations have been launched in 11 cases. Two of the imams had already been denied extensions to their residency permits.Blümel stressed that the clampdown was not anti-Islam, insisting that “it is not a contradiction to be both a practicing Muslim and a proud Austrian”.ATIB, which is the umbrella organisation for 60 associations with more than 100,000 members, said it made no secret of the fact that it funded imams in Austria. “This happens not because we want it to, but because there is no adequate training offered for imams in Austria,” Yasar Ersoy, its spokesman, told Austrian radio.Thomas Schmidinger, a political scientist, said he doubted whether outlawing outsider funding for Austria-based imams would have the effect of reining them in. “I think it’s far more likely to be the case that ATIB will feel marginalised and will try to find alternative, albeit illegal ways to finance imams,” he told Austrian media.He said extremist groups such as the Grey Wolves were likely to be driven underground, making it far harder for authorities to monitor them. He also said it was unfortunate the government had launched its clampdown in the middle of a Turkish election campaign, calling it “water on the wheels of the far right”.During last year’s Turkish referendum on expanding the president’s powers, tensions ran high between Vienna and Ankara after Austria said it would not allow campaign-related events. Relations were also strained by Kurz’s staunch opposition to Turkey’s bid to join the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7bf6ee64b2f21cd09388b06a72994b8bbb178d5/49_0_2872_1723/master/2872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c858a56ce19682e2ec984157fcd9a1a7","title":"un accuses libyan linked to eu funded coastguard of people trafficking","story":"Libyans associated with Italy’s deal to reduce migration also among six placed under sanctionsThe UN has imposed sanctions for people trafficking on Libyans closely associated with the country’s EU-funded coastguard or with a deal made with the previous Italian government to slow migration, in a move that raises doubts about European policy in the area. One of those subject to the UN asset freeze is a former militia leader, Abd Al Rahman al-Milad, who is the head of the EU-funded regional unit of the Libyan coastguard in Zawiyah.NGOs have long accused the Zawiyah coastguard of being the one most willing to use violence to drive Europe-bound migrant boats back to land. It has been suggested Milad is playing a double game in which, under the guise of the coastguard, he stops rival traffickers but continues to smuggle himself.The sanction listing says UN experts monitoring sanctions claimed Milad and other coastguard members were “directly involved in the sinking of migrant boats using firearms”.The UN sanctions raise questions about the viability of the highly pragmatic deals made the previous Italian government, notably by the former interior minister, Marco Minniti, with Libyan militia leaders.The listing says: “Several witnesses in criminal investigations have stated they were picked up at sea by armed men on a coastguard ship called Tallil (used by al-Milad) and taken to al-Nasr detention centre, where they are reportedly held in brutal conditions and subjected to beatings.”A second Libyan subject to sanctions is Ahmad Oumar al-Dabbashi, widely seen as central to a deal with the Italian interior ministry last year to control the flow of migrants.The UN documents state that his militia group controls “departure areas for migrants, camps, safe houses and boats” and has exposed migrants – including minors – to “brutal conditions and sometimes fatal circumstances on land and at sea”.Mus’ab Abu-Qarin, another of the six subject to an assets freeze, is accused in the UN listing of leading a transnational trafficking network, smuggling 45,000 people by sea in 2015 alone.Abu-Qarin, who also struck deals with the Italian government, is accused of organising a migrant boat journey from Libya to Italy on 18 April 2015 in which 800 people drowned after the boat sank off the Libyan coast. It was one of the worst migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean Sea.The Italian government has never been clear what money was handed to Libyan politicians or for what purpose.The Dutch national prosecutors’ office said: “These sanctions will help stop the flow of blood money … It will prevent them from buying protection in Libya which in turn can destabilise the region.”The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, welcomed the sanctions without making any mention of the background of some of the six. “This is the first time the UN has used sanctions against people traffickers, and builds on the work initiated by the UK in December 2017 – following reports of slave auctions in Libya in December 2017 – to secure a strong security council condemnation of those involved in people trafficking,” he said.Sanctions were imposed on six Libyans in total. The final two listed are Mohammed Kachlaf, head of the Shuhada al-Nasr brigade in Zawiyah, and Fitiwi Abdelrazak.The African Union said in December there were an estimated 400,000 to 700,000 migrants in more than 40 detention camps across Libya, many in inhumane conditions.The new Italian interior minister and leader of the far-right party the League, Matteo Salvini, has said his first overseas trip may be to Libya. He says he does not want Italy to be an accomplice in people trafficking.His predecessor Minniti has given a series of interviews arguing that his strategy of trying to co-operate with African governments and regional powerbrokers remains the best way to stop the flow of migration into Italy. He has urged Salvini to tone down his anti-African rhetoric if Italy is to ensure co-operation from Africa about the flow of migration to Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf256d2dc08f8e66e40aef821c611ba01311e15c/747_380_1674_1005/master/1674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f9fa71761c6e4ba1b0404f930cdd01","title":"vatican document hints at new debate over married clergy","story":"Bishops urged to consider how to broaden church’s reach in the AmazonThe Vatican has subtly suggested it is open to a new debate on whether married men and women can serve in official ministries, after it called on Catholic bishops who are working in the Amazon to think “courageously” about how to broaden the church’s reach in the region.A document published on Friday ahead of a 2019 special synod does not explicitly raise the issue of married men serving as clergy but says Catholic bishops need to think of new ways to allow the faithful to access the Eucharist, and acknowledges that the church is spread “precariously thin” in the region. It also calls on bishops to consider the role of women in the Amazon, and what ministerial roles they might play, “taking into account the central role women play today in the Amazonian church”.Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said at a press conference to discuss the document that the church was not making an “official declaration” about the role of married men and women serving in ministries, but he suggested there was room for debate.“Here we speak of ministry – there are lots of various forms of ministry,” he said. “Let’s leave freedom to the discussion. We are not trying to preclude anything.”Baldisseri, the general secretary of the synod of bishops, quoted previous remarks by Pope Francis that the church needed to “allow space for women in the church at all levels” while still confining itself to official doctrine, which bars women and married men from serving as priests.Some Vatican watchers have interpreted the language of the 14-page document as possibly raising the prospect that the church might allow married men and women to serve in new roles, at least in the Amazon.The Vatican has called for the meeting in part so that bishops can think of new ways to create a church “with an Amazonian face and a church with a native face”, the document says.At the same time, it emphasises the “cry of thousands” who have been deprived of the Sunday Eucharist because of the church’s challenges in the region.The preparatory document also focuses on environmental and cultural issues in the Amazon, as well as the church’s history of colonialism there."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Chair of inquiry into alleged smear campaign says people\u0026rsquos reliance on privilege a \u0026lsquosmokescreen\u0026rsquoTeenager had just completed second year at Moville Community CollegeActivists said plan to assist women in North with abortions is \u0026lsquoof great concern\u0026rsquoVaradkar meets Orange Order and says he is a \u0026lsquoneighbour not an invader\u0026rsquoPatrick McMahon (39) remembered as a kind father who had \u0026lsquoa great sense of fun\u0026rsquoSpecial Criminal Court agreed to relaxation of bail for 61-year-old accused of false imprisonment and threatening to kill\u0026Oacute R\u0026iacuteord\u0026aacutein says having trained personnel to respond to situations would help address issueBrown trout and other species killed in prime spawning tributary of Robe RiverThomas Fox (31) and siblings Regina (41) and Jonathan Keogh (32) on trial over Hutch killingJoseph Rafferty said he thought a friend had been having an affair with his wife and he heard voices in his head\u0026lsquoYou started quite a while ago when enthusiasm for Joyce was not as strong as now\u0026rsquoNew Testament \u0026lsquounambiguously regards homosexual activity as contrary to nature\u0026rsquoDean Kane breached every safeguard that that been drilled into him on lethal weapons, court toldPro-Life Campaign says there is no need for Government to legislate for abortion up to 12 weeksHis son told mourners his father packed more into 50 years than a man who would live to be 100Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) says courts should be required to take interests of child into accountLela Sivsivadze came to Ireland 15 years ago for work and has two Irish-born childrenRyan Bradley (18) accused of murdering Neil Reilly along with his father and two brothers"},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic near misses at level crossings caught on cctv","story":"  June 7, 2018Rail operators call for vigilance on International Level Crossing Safety Awareness Day "},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: TwitterTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has moved to reassure people in Northern Ireland concerned by the impact of Brexit.At a number of events in Northern Ireland on Friday Mr Varadkar said he was aware of deep worry that the absence of the Stormont Executive over the last 16 months had left the province voiceless in the ongoing negotiations.But he said he wanted to let people know “we are listening”.Mr Varadkar said the Government and other member states would now closely examine the British government’s latest paper on the backstop option of closely aligned regulation. He said the paper was a welcome step forward but still fell short of providing guarantees against a hard border.He also predicted new negotiations to restore devolution in the North may be unlikely until October at the earliest.In his sixth visit to the province as Taoiseach, he said there was a lack of trust between the two main parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, compounded by the impact of the complexities of Brexit which had injected a “whole new uncertainty”.But if a way forward on the UK exit from the EU could be found by October an “opportunity may then exist.”The Taoiseach spent equal amounts of time with representatives of the two main communities during his Friday visit, launching the annual west Belfast féile at an event in St Mary’s College on the Falls Road - after a morning meeting with senior leaders of the Orange Order at their headquarters in the east of the city.It was the first visit of a sitting Taoiseach to the Orange Heritage Museum, Schomberg House with Mr Varadkar admitting he had travelled through a town in Canada last year named after Schomberg without realising the significance.But speaking to reporters, he emphasised he had come as a “neighbour not an invader”.As if to demonstrate his bona fides, Mr Varadkar began his day with a private visit to Baroness Paisley, the widow of the late former First Minister and DUP leader who struck up an unlikely rapport in late life with Martin McGuinness and Bertie Ahern.Mr Varadkar spoke of his hope that “new relationships can be forged and old difficulties overcome” between the Orange Order and nationalists in Northern Ireland.“We should all be very proud of what makes us what we are,” he told Orange leaders inside the building.During a private tour of the museum, accompanied by Orange leaders north and south, Mr Varadkar insisted he came “with no hidden agenda”.There were no protests outside the building, which was the former headquarters of Castlereagh Council when its leader was the then DUP leader Peter Robinson, and applause from local residents as the Taoiseach both arrived - 40 minutes late - and left, more than an hour later.One local man, John Sloane, had come to watch “an historic event”, he said.“Can you imagine this happening with Jack Lynch or Charlie Haughey coming here, or even Bertie Ahern and that wasn’t that long ago? It just would not have happened,” he added.East Belfast DUP MP Gavin Robinson, whose party has regularly lambasted Mr Varadkar and accused him of interfering in Northern Ireland affairs, stressed the importance of the occasion.“It is important not least because it is the first time the leaders of the lodges from the south have had the opportunity to meet the Taoiseach in the headquarters or the organisation, which of course is an all-Ireland organisation.”There were moments of humour, too, as when Orange Grand Chaplain the Rev Ian McClean, a retired Presbyterian clergyman, told Mr Varadkar he had “escaped” from this week’s General Assembly just down the road in Belfast to attend the visit.Mr Varadkar quipped: “I hope you are not missing any important votes.”The grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Edward Stevenson welcomed the visit as a “significant moment” with the recognition of the long-standing cultural identity of the Orange family in the south.The Taoiseach’s proposal to further develop an educational exchange scheme involving school pupils from the Republic visiting the Orange museum was also welcomed by Mr Stevenson, who said: “It can only lead to a better understanding, by all those who live on the island of Ireland, of the cultural heritage and traditions of Orangeism its history and its continuing relevance in modern society.To mark the visit, Mr Varadkar was presented with a Galway Crystal replica of the Boyne Obelisk - a monument which formerly stood at the site of the Battle of the Boyne in Co Meath, until it was destroyed in 1923.The Taoiseach rounded off his trip to Belfast by stopping for a pint of beer in Maverick gay bar in the city centre. Barman James Magennis said: “It was great to see him and it’s great to have a Taoiseach representing the LGBT community”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3524151.1528474918!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says all uk extension of backstop is not an option","story":"An economic arrangement to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland cannot be extended to the whole of Britain, as London has proposed, the European Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union Chief Negotiator in charge of Brexit negotiations Michel Barnier speaks in Brussels on June 8, 2018. Photograph: John ThysAFPGetty ImagesThe extension of the mooted Northern Ireland backstop on an all-UK basis proposed by prime minister Theresa May will not be possible, the UK was told on Friday.The British proposals are a means of avoiding the need for post-Brexit customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier made clear on Friday that the special arrangements for Northern Ireland, which would see it remain part of the EU’s customs zone, “were devised for the specific situation of Northern Ireland”.They were “exceptional” measures to safeguard the frictionless border in the context of the Belfast Agreement and cross-Border co-operation, he said.“Our backstop cannot apply to the whole UK,” he said, also insisting that the backstop could not be a “temporary, time-limited” option.“Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory – what is feasible for a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK,” he said.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and the North in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.Mr Barnier was briefing journalists in Brussels following this week’s Brexit talks and in response to the publication on Thursday of the the UK paper on a “temporary customs arrangement” solution to the Northern Ireland backstop issue.He welcomed the paper and what he said was the engagement of the UK in drafting text for the Withdrawal Treaty. He said he was not ruling out any of its proposals but it “raised more questions than answers”.He also said the “UK recognises that the proposals in its paper cannot qualify as a backstop since the issue of full regulatory alignment is not addressed. We need regulatory alignment to avoid a hard border”.Alluding to the reality that regulatory ergence between the North and the rest of the UK could mean controls on the Irish Sea, he argued that “checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than at customs posts along 500km of the Northern Ireland Border”. Similar checks were already in operation, he said.And he spoke of what he called an “all-weather agreement” on the backstop – “a guarantee that will function in all circumstances”, whether or not a broader trade agreement was reached between the UK and the EU. “A Backstop means a backstop” and a “temporary backstop does not correspond to what we and Ireland need”, he said.Mr Barnier said that he was confident that he would be able to present to the EU summit at the end of the month evidence of progress on a number of fronts and emphasised that there would not be the same requirement of “sufficient progress” that previous summits had sought.He emphasised the absolute requirement for full agreement on the orce treaty, the Withdrawal Agreement, by October, playing down the significance of what has been seen as a June deadline.Among the issues which have seen progress this week, Mr Barnier said, were practical measures to co-ordinate North-South regulatory alignment in areas such as agriculture, environment and electricity supply.In the Withdrawal Agreement strand of talks there were still three main areas of disagreement: on elements of preserving citizens rights post-Brexit, on the future recognition of “geographical indicators” – the special designations of regional products, on which British proposals have not yet been received – and on governance issues, specifically the role of the European Court of Justice.But he expressed exasperation that “in all the British papers we have received there is a thread of continuity that is quite paradoxical given that this country has itself chosen to leave the EU”. The UK still seems to wanted to maintain all the benefits of membership, he said, and when the EU replied “that these are simply not available to those outside”, some tried to blame the union for the problem . “I will not be pressurised by this form of blame game.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523186.1528400888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s remainers are facing a golden opportunity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit minister David Davis, who threatened to resign this week.

Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersDowning Street has said Britain will never accept a backstop that applies only to Northern Ireland, following EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s rejection of an arrangement that applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. “The prime minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs,” a government spokesperson said.“All parties must recall their commitment in the joint report to protect the Belfast agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”Mr Barnier rejected of two of the British backstop proposal’s most important elements – extending the backstop to the whole of the UK and making it time-limited. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, on whose 10 votes at Westminster Ms May depends for her majority, said his party could not agree to Mr Barnier’s proposals.“Michel Barnier’s latest comments demonstrate he has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland. We will not accept such a proposal,” he said.Irish sources said Mr Barnier’s reaction to the British proposals was more hardline than expected, and attributed this to last minute changes made to the British paper, inserted to satisfy the hard Brexiteers in Theresa May’s cabinet.However, most sources in Dublin and Brussels said they believed that the threat of a collapse of the talks in June had receded, and that the two sides would “muddle through” the next few weeks and through the June summit, leaving most of the key issues to be settled in October.One senior figure in Dublin, however, warned of diminishing patience with Mrs May in key European capitals.There is some concern in Dublin that the question of the backstop, and the broader arrangements for the future relationship that will affect Ireland and the border, will all be settled together in the autumn, raised the prospect of Irish interests being “squeezed” as part of a wider deal.In the North, the DUP reacted with hostility to Mr Barnier’s statement. The DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the the DUP would “not tolerate the annexation of Northern Ireland” while the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that Mr Barnier “has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom”.Earlier, the prime minister expressed full confidence in foreign secretary Boris Johnson but declined to comment on leaked remarks he made at a dinner this week. In a speech to the Conservative Way Forward group, a recording of which was leaked to BuzzFeed, Mr Johnson said the issue of the Irish Border had taken on too great a significance in Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way. We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly,” he said.The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment directly on Mr Johnson’s comments but rejected the sentiments expressed about the issue of the Border.“Northern Ireland has been a priority for the prime minister from day one, and will continue to be so,” the spokesperson said.“It is a priority not because the EU has made it one, but because the prime minister is committed to the union and the emergence of a hard border would put that at risk. I’m not going to engage on the wording, but this is our position and why it is so vital to the prime minister.”In the speech, the foreign secretary described the Treasury as “the heart of Remain” and suggested that the aggressive, unpredictable approach Donald Trump might take to Brexit talks would have been more fruitful.During a visit to Germany on Friday, chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond said his experience told him that a collaborative approach was generally more productive than a confrontational one.“Finding a mutually beneficial outcome is the only way forward. That is the firm intention of my government. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said so very clearly,” Mr Hammond said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called on Ms May to sack her foreign secretary, saying his remarks at the dinner offered further evidence that he was not fit to occupy one of the great offices of state.“Any prime minister that had any semblance of authority would have got rid of Boris Johnson a long time ago, not just because of comments like this,” she said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

My company manager then gave me a call, so I thought I was going to have to go on at the Theatre Royal.“But he told me that Mamma Mia!’s company manager was on the phone asking if I was in the building because they had an emergency. I simply got told: ‘They need you there, can you run over to Mamma Mia! and go now’.”The reaction from the 1,100-strong audience when Parry, 35, stepped on stage was euphoric, with loud applause greeting her appearance.The Novello Theatre, in London\u0026#39s West EndDuring the scramble to find a replacement for Deverill they had been told theatre management were doing their best to make sure the award winning show could continue, but few held out much hope until they managed to get hold of Parry.“There was huge applause when she came on stage,” said a spokesman for the Novello Theatre. “They were desperate to see the show so you can imagine the reaction.”Parry last played the part of Donna Sheridan on stage in 2013 - although she did reprise the role on a cruise ship last year - so says she was a bit rusty, particularly in the dance scenes.“Suddenly had to revert right back, so I was being pulled around stage and guided along by others as we went through the night,” said Parry.“It was a packed house and they were marvellous. I honestly wish I could have taped the reaction and had it on demand for whenever I’m feeling down. I think it’s a really good moment to celebrate the camaraderie of the West End, that 42nd Street wanted me to go and help out another show and that we could pull all that together for the audience.”Mr Effeney said the chances of Parry being able to step in had been “one in a billion”, telling the Evening Standard: “Otherwise we would have had to abandon the show and refund everybody’s money.”He added: “It was a completely unique experience for the audience.

Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated.Cataracts are more common in the elderly and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities such as driving.The Queen at Epsom Downs Racecourse on June 1A family history of cataracts can increase the risk of developing them.The Queen Mother had an operation to remove a cataract from her left eye in 1995 when she was 95 but, unlike her daughter, she spent a night in King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital after the surgery.Video: The Queen attends Chelsea Flower Show on May 21The Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution. In 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital. She usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent, which results in cloudy or misty vision.This can prevent someone from driving, undertaking work that requires fine detail and recognising faces.Surgery to remove and replace the affected lens with an artificial one is the most common surgical procedure carried out on the NHS.Around 390,000 cataract surgeries take place each year in England and 16,000 in Wales, according to the eye research charity Fight for Sight.The condition most commonly affect adults as a result of ageing. Most people start to develop cataracts after the age of 65, but some people in their forties and fifties can also develop them.Surgery to remove a patient\u0026#39s cataracts. File pictureCataracts, which can affect one or both eyes, are a major cause of sight loss. But the surgery is a straightforward procedure that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.It is often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic, meaning the patient can go home the same day.During the operation, the surgeon makes a tiny cut in the eye to remove the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear plastic one.On the NHS, patients are offered monofocal lenses, which have a single point of focus - either near or distance vision.Those going private, like the Queen, can choose either a multifocal or an accommodating lens, which allows the eye to focus on both near and distant objects.The Queen wears sunglasses at Epsom Downs on June 1 - just days after her cataracts procudureMost people will need to wear glasses for some tasks, like reading, after surgery regardless of the type of lens they have fitted.It can take four to six weeks to fully recover from cataract surgery. If cataracts affect both eyes, two separate operations are required, usually carried out six to 12 weeks apart.The risk of serious complications developing as a result of cataract surgery is very low.Worldwide, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness, according to The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, for which the Queen\u0027s daughter-in-law the Countess of Wessex is a global ambassador.Some 65 million people across the globe have been left blind or with moderate to severe visual impairment due to the condition.The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.She has called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.In November 2017, the Prince of Wales led the nation in honouring the country\u0027s war dead on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph.It was the first time that the Queen, as head of state, had watched the ceremony from a nearby balcony, and was seen as a sign of the royal family in transition and an acknowledgement of her age.Just before Christmas 2016, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh both fell ill with heavy colds, forcing them to delay their trip to Sandringham by a day.The Queen watched the 2017 Remembrance Sunday service from a balconyThe Queen was not well enough to attend the Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church and also missed the New Year\u0027s Day one. She later described it as a particularly grisly mixture of cold and flu.She turned 90 in 2016 and, the same year, used the lift rather than stairs to enter Parliament for the State Opening, avoiding the 26 steps of the royal staircase at the Sovereign\u0027s Entrance.Buckingham Palace said the modest adjustment to arrangements were made for the Queen\u0027s comfort. The decision was attributed to the Queen suffering from knee pain.In 2014, the Prince of Wales stood in for the Queen for part of the Order of the Bath service to avoid her having to make an extra journey up and down some steep steps in full regalia.In November 2013, the Duke of Cambridge stepped in to represent the Queen at an investiture ceremony after she suffered some mild discomfort with her ankle after a busy weekend of engagements including the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.Video: The Queen\u0027s life on screenHer first hospital stay in 10 years came in 2013 when she was 86 after she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea when she was due to present St David\u0027s Day leeks to the 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh.On March 3 2013, she was admitted to King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital to be assessed. A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled.The Queen spent one night in hospital and left thanking staff and smiling before being driven to Buckingham Palace to rest.It was thought her public appearances were back on track until Buckingham Palace announced on the morning of the Commonwealth Day Observance service on March 11 that she regrettably could no longer attend as she continues to recover following her recent illness.It was the first Commonwealth Day Observance service she had missed in 20 years, the last occasion being when she had flu in 1993.The Queen leaves the King Edward VII hospital in March 2013 following a short stayThe Queen, who placed great importance to her role as Head of the Commonwealth, did however attend the Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House on the evening of March 11 to sign the new Commonwealth Charter.Buckingham Palace insisted it was just the tail end of the symptoms and that her condition had not worsened.But the next day she cancelled her engagements for the rest of the week, with her son, the Duke of York, saying later that it was sensible not to risk her coming out, but that she was not ill.Her illnesses have been few and far between over the years. She has suffered from back pain, and also had operations to remove torn cartilage from both knees.She caught measles when Prince Charles was two months old in 1949 and had to be separated from her baby son.Queen Elizabeth II: Our monarch in picturesThe first time the Queen was actually admitted to hospital was in July 1982 when she had a wisdom tooth extracted at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London.The Queen\u0027s no-fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital.It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham.Please review our commenting policyThe Queen opens new exhibition at Westminster AbbeyThe general election: one year onSupermarket scandal: Pork and turkey found in vegan and \u0026#39meat free\u0026#39 mealsComment: A third runway would generate billions for the economy.

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

One of the three is exactly the same size as our own world, and the others are only ever so slightly bigger.Otherwise, the planets are probably inhospitable: they are very close to their star and therefore very warm. But as yet another discovery of rocket planets that seem to show they are common throughout the universe, they are another sign that it could be more hospitable than we\u0027d thought.The other system has two much larger planets. Those worlds – which like the first system, orbit a red dwarf – are known as super Earths.Red dwarfs are old and relatively small, and the two stars are much less hot than our Sun. But the newly discovered worlds are much closer, meaning that the temperature is probably too hot for life.The five planets were found by the K2 mission of Nasa\u0027s Kepler satellite. That looks for the brief dips of light that happen when a planet passes in front of its star, and allows scientists to use the details of those dips to work out what they might be like.Scientists now hope to use further observations – from the new James Webb Space Telescope – to understand more about the planets\u0027 atmospheres.

We hope this means that disability issues aren’t being downgraded.“Life can be tough for many disabled people. It can be difficult to get and stay in work, life’s still far too expensive if you are disabled, and negative attitudes can mean day-to-day activities are an unnecessary struggle.“Government must show leadership, and implement a cross-Whitehall strategy to tackle the issues that affect disabled people every day.” he added.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Levels in the capital have consistently breached legal levels for years.On top of the new measures, a major new study launched by the mayor will test how policies like the ULEZ affect children’s respiratory health by comparing children from London schools with those from neighbouring Luton whose schools are in traffic-restricted zones.All the children will have their lung health monitored over a four-year period in the study, which is being led by Queen Mary University.Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have won legal challenges against the government three times over inadequate efforts to reduce illegal levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide.Reacting to the announcement, ClientEarth CEO James Thornton said: “This is a welcome announcement from the mayor, who has shown he is prepared to take steps to protect Londoners’ health from the city’s toxic air. Political leaders across the UK should take note.”“The arrival of the world’s first and biggest ULEZ in London is cause for a celebration,” said Paul Morozzo, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace.\u0026nbspThousands of Londoners contributed to consultations to make this a reality and it will have a major impact on air quality in the city, improving the lives of millions of people.\u0026nbsp“London has moved into the fast lane when it comes to tackling harmful air pollution, and now central government and the car industry must change up a gear and show they can match Sadiq Khan’s ambition.”\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK’s plan tries to get around introducing checks by keeping the whole UK aligned with those rules, and also introduces a time-limit on the backstop.\u0026nbspBut while Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid he was continuing the study the UK proposals, he warned that applying the backstop plan to the whole UK was not an option.“Let me be very clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland,” he said.“What does it do? On customs, Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory. What is feasible with a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK.\u0026nbsp“On regulatory alignment we have been pragmatic and developed the least disruptive system for citizens and businesses on both sides. Let’s go to pragmatism. Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a\u0026nbsp500km\u0026nbspland border.”He also suggested the backstop could not be time-limited or temporary, as the UK has requested,\u0026nbspwarning: “Backstop means backstop.”\u0026nbspThe chief negotiator said he would continue looking at the UK’s proposals, despite highlighting what he said were a series of problems with them. He said the plan needed to address “full regulatory alignment” rather than only customs, that it needed to respect the integrity of the single market, and that the arrangement should be “all-weather” and prevent a hard border in all circumstances.\u0026nbspAsked why he was continuing to look at the British proposal if he had raised such fatal flaws with it, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsprepeated his familiar refrain that Britain’s negotiators appeared to want to keep the benefits of the EU without accepting the obligations of membership.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbsphe added: “When we tell our British counterparts that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created by the European Union… some parties in the United Kingdom are responsible for the consequences of that decision.\u0026nbsp“Let me say the following: we’re not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union we respect that democratic decision\u0026nbspand we are implementing it.”He said there had been some progress on other issues but that sticking points included data protection, geographical indications for products, and some matters relating to state aid. Theresa May is set to attend a summit in Brussels later this month that the EU has characterised as a staging-post to a final deal, which it wants signed by October.A British government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just 0.85 per cent of the public say Brexit has made them less likely to support a united Ireland.Support for the cause is more popular among\u0026nbspthe younger generation than the old, with 49.4 per cent of under-45s backing a break with the UK compared to 37.7 per cent who want to stay in it.\u0026nbspThough Catholics are significantly more likely to support joining the Republic than Protestants, a minority of the latter, 8.5 per cent, say they support leaving the UK. An overall majority (50.2 per cent) in Northern Ireland’s capital, Belfast,\u0026nbspsupport a united Ireland.Northern Ireland has become the focus of Brexit talks because it is set to become the only future land border between the EU and UK. But under the Good Friday Agreement which brought an end to the Troubles, there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026nbspThough the Government and EU both say they are committed to avoiding a hard border, leaked tapes released on Thursday showed Boris Johnson, the\u0026nbspforeign secretary,\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbspit was “just beyond belief” that the issue was being taken so seriously and that\u0026nbsp focusing on such a “small” item amounted to “allowing the tail to wag the dog”.The YouGov poll also found that 81.3 per cent of the Northern Ireland population do not believe that politicians reflect concerns of the people in the six counties well, while just 17.1 per cent did.Leo Varadkar, the\u0026nbspIrish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that a border poll would be “isive” and “a bad idea”.\u0026nbspThe taoiseach, who is visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, told the Good Morning Ulster programme: “We should be respecting the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is power sharing within Northern Ireland, ever-increasing cooperation within the north and south and peace in Britain and Ireland.“While the Good Friday Agreement provides for the possibility of a border poll, and would allow that to pass by a majority of one, I don’t think the time or the conditions are right.“I think the focus should be on getting the institutions up and running again, rather than focusing on a border poll.”His comments came after former first minister Peter Robinson argued that any future border poll could not be conducted on the basis of a simple majority.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Green Belt \u0026ndash will cover an area almost eight times the size of Greater London and is aimed at prevenint new damaging activities such as dredging or offshore development, while existing harmful interests will be minimised or stopped to allow habitats to recover.MCZs are one of the several types of protected areas around the British coastline.\u0026nbspTo date, 50 MCZs have already been designated since 2013 and the new tranche are expected to be confirmed within a year, following consultation.If approved, the total area of UK coast protected by all the various preservation measures will cover around 220,000 square km.Mr Gove said: \u0026ldquoThe UK is surrounded by some of the richest and most erse sea life in the world and we must protect these precious habitats for future generations.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoToday marks an important step towards completing our Blue Belt.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe are creating safe havens for our cherished wildlife and putting the UK at the forefront of marine protection.Conservationists welcomed the announcement but say MCZs must be properly managed if they are to safeguard the seas.Dr Lyndsey Dodds, head of marine policy at WWF, added: \u0026ldquoOur oceans, and the sea life like whales and basking sharks that make it their home, are under increasing threat.\u0026ldquoMCZs can play an essential role in restoring their health.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIf all the sites proposed by the Government are ultimately designated protected areas, that would create a network across a large area that could have a real impact.\u0026ldquoBut even then, they must be properly managed and enforced if they are to succeed in preserving our seas, coastlines and the wildlife and communities that depend on them.Among the 41 proposed areas are some of England\u0026rsquos best known and valued marine locations.The Orford inshore area on the Suffolk coast is an important spawning ground for Dover and lemon sole as well as sandeels, which are vital for the seabird food chain.Bringing colour below the waves are burrowing anemones, sea cucumbers and a variety of starfish, while important shark species such as the small-spotted catshark can be found.Off Land\u0026rsquos End, Cape Bank with its rocky reef system covers almost 500 square kilometres and is to home to sea bass, a host of flatfish as well as the

That is what we did post the case with the Skripals in Salisbury.She went on: \u0026ldquoThere is the wider case to be made on the international order, for example on chemical weapons.On the new agreement, she said: \u0026ldquoThere is no doubt that foreign interference in our democratic institutions and processes, and other forms of hostile activity, pose a strategic threat to our shared values and interests.\u0026ldquoSo I welcome this agreement that the G7 will exchange information, co-ordinate action, and develop strategies to reinforce our democracies, strengthen our societies\u0026rsquo resilience and uphold freedom of expression and a free and independent media in the face of this growing threat.\u0026ldquoThe announcement shows that the G7 will not tolerate foreign interference in any one of our democracies, that we are getting organised, and that we will take coordinated action against those who seek to violate the rules-based international system.\u0026ldquoCalling out malicious activity helps to end hostile states\u0026rsquo false sense of impunity, demonstrates our awareness of their activity, and underlines our unwavering willingness to defend ourselves.European Council President Donald Tusk expressed his opposition to Russia re-joining the G7Meanwhile, a Downing Street source confirmed that Mrs May is strongly opposed to the G7 readmitting Russia.The senior source said: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister has always said we should engage with Russia but beware.\u0026ldquoWe should remind ourselves why the G8 became the G7 - it was after Russia illegally annexed Crimea.\u0026ldquoSince then we have seen malign activity from Russia in a whole variety of ways, including on the streets of Salisbury in the UK.\u0026ldquoBefore any conversations can take place about Russia rejoining, it needs to change its approach.Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk voiced his strong opposition to Russia being readmitted and said he had spoken to the new Italian Prime Minister on the issue.He said: \u0026ldquoI see a lot of speculation about G6 plus one, or G7 minus one, or G7 plus one. Let\u0026rsquos leave seven as it is. It\u0026rsquos a lucky number.

something which has already been thrown out by Britain and Northern Ireland.Mrs Mays Government partners, the DUP, would never agree to anything which separates them from the mainland.No10 hit back with a furious statement, insisting Mrs May would never do anything to split up the UK.A spokesperson said:  The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.And the DUP were also fuming, saying Mr Barniers latest demands for Northern Ireland shows they have no respect for the UK at all.Deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds stormed: This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland.We will not accept such a proposal.Instead he said the focus should be on getting a trade deal, and to forget about the back up plans altogether.The EUs chief Brexit negotiator caused chaos this afternoon when he appeared to throw out Britains Northern Ireland backstop plans altogether.He was originally thought to have said that there was no way the plans for the whole of the UK would be acceptable - but then clarified later in a tweet that he was talking about his own plans.This is not a rejection of the UK customs paper on which discussions continue, he added.Elsewhere in his press conference, Mr Barnier stormed in an angry rant: When we tell them, our British counterparts, that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created and this is the result of them deciding to leave, some try to make us responsible for the consequence of that decision.We are not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The UK has decided to leave the EU - we respect that and are implementing that, but the UK has to accept that has consequences.And he called on Britain to show more trust and realism in ongoing talks with the bloc.Mr Barnier said the option to keep Northern Ireland inside the EUs customs union was an exceptional one and that nothing like it had ever been agreed before.But he did say he was willing to talk to find a solution.Mrs May hit back immediately to Mr Barniers comments, saying she would never compromise the unity of the UK.That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts.Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.The news comes just hours after it emerged that Boris Johnson had lashed out at Remainers in the cabinet, spilling Mrs Mays top team into an open civil war.The Foreign Secretary described the Treasury as the heart of Remain and warned of a meltdown in EU negotiations to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here’s more about them and what they do.Renowned for their discipline and courage, Coldstream Guards are infantry soldiers who specialise in light role operations.These include performing reconnaissance, operating machine guns and mortars, and engaging enemy troops on foot and in light vehicles.This versatility makes the regiment one of the most important fighting units in the British Army.Coldstream Guards also have a ceremonial role as protectors of the royal palaces, including Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.The Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards is one of the oldest and best-known military marching bands in the world.It is the oldest continuously serving regiment in the Army, with origins that date back to the English Civil War.The regiment was formed in 1650 as the Regiment of Foot under the command of George Monck and was part of Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army.It became known as the Coldstream Guards in 1670, upon the death of General Monck.The 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards has answered the call of duty at almost every conflict with British involvement, including Operation Herrick in Afghanistan and Operation Telic in Iraq.The regiment’s motto is “Nulli Secundus” meaning “Second to None”.In general, Battalions have two Colours used for their flags.The First is known as The Royal or Queen’s Colour and the Second is usually called the Regimental Colour.The Queens Colours for the 1st Battalion has a crimson background and bears the star of the Order of the Garter in the centre with the Imperial Crown above.In addition, 47 Battle Honours are arranged in vertical rows on either side of the centre.The Regimental Colour has the Union Flag as its background.In the centre is one of 24 Company Badges ensigned with the Imperial Crown.A further 47 Battle Honours are arranged in vertical rows on either side of the central Company Badge.In the upper left corner, next to the pike is the Battalions number in Roman numerals.The 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards has been given the honour of Trooping its Colour for the Queen’s Birthday parade this year on June 9.Trooping the Colour is a military parade which goes all the way back to the 17th Century.On the day, the battalion will have to perfect hundreds of precision drill moves and put on their best uniform display.The Trooping the Colour parade officially begins when the Queen leaves Buckingham Palace in a carriage.Until 1987, she would make this journey riding side-saddle on a horse, dressed in the colours being trooped that year.The Monarch then travels down the Mall in front of crowds towards Horse Guards Parade at Whitehall, near to Downing Street.On arrival, she is greeted by a royal salute from the soldiers on parade, before inspecting the troops.Then, the colours being trooped are carried down the ranks and showed to the soldiers.The Queen then leads the troops back down the Mall to Buckingham Palace for a second salute, marking an end to the official trooping.After the ceremony, the Queen is joined by other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palaces famous balcony for a 41-gun salute from neighbouring Green Park, following by a Red Arrows fly-past.Her Majesty has taken part in the ceremony every year since her coronation, except in 1955 when it was cancelled due to a national rail strike."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411655085-e1528388688807.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"i sold my innocent picture to a stock image site for 50 and now im the face of bestiality","story":"But what happens when those pictures end up in places you hadnt even imagined - such as alongside an article declaring how youre turned on by orgies with fat, old men or holding a placard saying youre a sex offender?Becoming the poster boys and girls for such causes is a far cry from where those posing for inoffensive stock images - used in newspapers, magazines and adverts when no suitable pics are available - believe theyll end up.This week, a Twitter thread went viral after stock models shared their accounts of the hilarious and surprising campaigns they had been linked to, following @marleybennett joke that he looked like the model on a tobacco warning label.Here, they share their faces bizarre final destinations.First to respond was Yair Kivaiko who was surprised to find his photo on an article about bestiality last year after uploading the image to a stock photo site.The 36-year-old product manager, told Sun Online: It was just a photo Id taken for fun with my parents dogs in their back yard about four or five years ago and I decided to sell it via an app online to make some extra cash.I was mortified when I saw it on an article about bestiality.It took me a really long time to tell my friends and family what had happened. I would never want to be recognised as that guy by people that had read the article.But despite the questionable associations, Yair doesnt regret selling the photo.I love the picture and enjoy seeing it from time-to-time on other ads, he says.I could have done without the bestiality story, but it was a minor website and luckily the article is no longer available online so theres no real harm done. I wasnt sure how to react at first, but today I look at it as a funny turn of events and laugh about it.Niccolò Massariello, a Spanish writer for Vice, revealed how his stock photos ended up on adverts for booze, milk, the Catholic Church and even paraphimosis  - a horrifying penis condition in which the foreskin gets trapped behind the tip of the penis.Following a tricky break up, Niccolò embarked on an impulsive photoshoot with a mate to try and take his mind off stuff, and signed away his rights to the images without realising the potential repercussions.He discovered his images had been sold months later when he saw his face on an article about terrorists on a Catholic website.“That in itself wasnt so bad, but it was then that I realised I had no control over what might happen to my face,” he told Vice.In the following months, Niccolò’s face was used to promote anything and everything, from gluten-free drinks and Columbian spirits to articles on vindictive exes and “jerks” at work.Things then went from bad to worse, with Niccolò finding his increasingly-popular face on the cover of a book about monsters, an advert for shaving, and, finally, on national campaign about a very serious penis problem in Venezuela.As I was getting up one morning a friend from Venezuela asked me on Whatsapp if I had – or had ever had – paraphimosis, a very serious penis issue, he explained.I told my friend that I might have had some issues down there in the past, but that I dont remember it being called that.Nicos friend then informed him that he was the poster boy for paraphimosis in Venezuela.I know I cant really complain – I was fully conscious when I had those pictures taken and I actively signed away the rights to my face, he says.Still, that doesnt mean I dont rue the day I posed for those pictures. Briefly feeling a little better about myself that day does not compare to the fact I have no idea where my face will show up next.Like many others in her situation, Samantha Ovens stock image modelling shots - which were originally taken for a campaign on cold and flu medication - were used for something she could never have imagined.Samantha, who is gay, was out with her friends when she was first alerted to the fact that her face had been used on article, titled: “I fantasise about group sex with old, obese men,” on the s anonymous sex column.The piece, written in first person, explained how the author, a 31-year-old woman, struggled with fantasies about being “passed around” by fat, ugly old men.“The thing that really turns me on is the idea of having to lift their stomachs and search for their penises, which are always difficult to find and a bit on the soft side,” is just one of the graphic lines in the first paragraph which Samantha’s image was next to.Luckily, the successful model, who usually specialises in portraying mums on shoot, found the whole thing hilarious.I was with my partners mum [when I first saw it], Samantha told the  later. I screeched with laughter and said: Oh. You have to see this.“How can you take it seriously? There are bigger things in this life to get concerned about.In a much more serious case, a British family’s image was used on a poster campaign by an Irish group opposing gay marriage ahead of the 2015 referendum - a campaign which they strongly disagreed with.In an anonymous interview with the BBC, the family said they were given a free photo shoot in exchange for allowing the photographer to sell the images on.The photo was not stolen from us... we have no claim over (or rights to) the picture, and we do not claim otherwise, the family said.We just wanted publicly to say that we disagreed with the No campaign and were unhappy about their use of our image, but we acknowledge that theyre allowed to do so.Other examples of awkwardly-placed stock images include Simon Naylors face on an article about Viagra which was pointed out to him in his local pub.Thought nothing of signing over a few headshots for use as stock images, until my local pub landlord spotted me in Take A Break, he tweeted.But we dont think its quite as bad as this poor girls holiday snap being used as an advert for colonic procedures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That position will not change.\"The Commission\u0027s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.

Unless your child is taller than 135cm or over the age of 12 then they legally need to be in a car seat. And quite apart from the law, kids\u0027 car seats save lives and prevent serious injuries. When riding a bike it\u0027s important to have the right safety gear too. Although there is no legal requirement to wear a helmet, recent research shows that wearing one significantly reduces the risk of sustaining a head injury. Child Safety Week is designed to help parents and carers understand how best to keep kids safe and Halfords has an amazing range of bike and car equipment that will help. From car seats to bike lights there\u0027s lots of gear to keep your little ones safe on the road and lots of in-store expert advice to help you fit what you buy. Car safety: Babies and toddlers    Very small children need additional protection and modern car seats offer a lot of features to keep your baby as safe as possible – for example, extra neck and head supports mean that they are protected in an impact. The Joie Spin 360 is versatile. It can be rear-facing for infants up to 9kg and switched to forward-facing for kids between 9 and 18kg. It rotates so you can get your baby out of the car easily and it has five recline settings for both forward and rear-facing modes. ISOFIX compliance means it mounts to hard anchors in your car for maximum safety. Car safety: Older kids  Once your kids weigh more than 15kg they need a group 2-3 booster seat. These are adjustable to allow your children to use them up until 12 years or a weight of 36kg. After that weight, they can rely on normal car seatbelts. The Joie Trilo Inkewell has washable seat covers (crucial, given the amount of time they\u0027re used for and how messy little ones can be) and offer side impact protection and an adjustable headrest. There\u0027s even a cupholder! If you don\u0027t have ISOFIX mounts in your car then the Halfords Highback Booster Seat offers excellent protection and are secured by the car\u0027s seatbelt. There\u0027s an included cupholder, washable cover and adjustable headrest. It also has side impact protection too, as you\u0027d expect.  Halfords also has an in-store car seat demo and fitting service too, which will help you learn how the seats need to be fitted and ensure they’re compatible with your car. Car safety: High-backed or backless boosters There are two different kinds of booster seat on the market. High-backed tend to have more advantages which include supporting a child’s head, allowing them to sleep and protecting them in an accident. High-backed seats also help to keep the seatbelt correctly positioned on children, especially smaller kids. Backless booster seats are, on the whole, cheaper though and may suit older and larger children slightly more than those with backs. Bike safety: helmets    The first thing any young cyclist needs is a helmet. Young kids might like to choose a fun design and Halfords has Polka Dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design, along with a range of fun colours.

The admission is buried in an 82-page research report that was quietly slipped online today while MPs are away from Parliament. Charities demanded reform after the shock findings about Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one monthly payment. Tory ministers boast modern and flexible UC is fairer and will ensure work pays. More than 800,000 new claimants are already on the benefit and existing claimants will start being moved to it from 2019.  Yet the survey reveals 44% of claimants were either falling behind with bills or experiencing real financial difficulties three months into their UC claim. That figure reduced by just a fraction to 40% for people who were eight or nine months into their claim. In one group, a third of claimants admitted they took money from friends and family, while 11% applied for a bank overdraft. Others were forced to use charities, payday loan firms and doorstep lenders, the survey confirmed. Meanwhile just over a third (35-36%) were in arrears on housing costs. And for almost half of those people (44%), the arrears had got bigger by the time they were eight or nine months into their claim. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said the figures show Universal Credit is a dismal failure.  It is clear that there are still many people who months into their claim, are being left with too little to live on, she said. Universal Credit once had strong poverty-reducing potential but big funding reductions have meant it is failing to achieve its original aims. Many of its design faults have been allowed to go uncorrected. Unless funding for Universal Credit is restored and its design re-visited, this once flagship benefit will continue to fail. The survey involving 4,202 people was carried out by IFF research for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) between March and September last year.

The Prime Minister was left humiliated at the G7 after her Foreign Secretary suggested Donald Trump would do a better job of Brexit. But the PM appears powerless to stop him - even though he broke Cabinet unity rules. This time last year, Theresa May threatened Mr Johnson by warning no minister was unsackable. Yet today, battling several Brexiteers in her Cabinet, she was unable to repeat the threat.  Asked if Boris Johnson was unsackable, she told Sky News: The foreign secretary Boris Johnson has strong views on Brexit. She was asked the same question again at the G7 summit in Canada, but she dodged it again. The Prime Minister said: He has strong views on Brexit but so do I. That’s why I’m getting on with the job of delivering what the British people want, Brexit, for us to leave the European Union, to take back control of our money and laws and our borders, but ensuring that as we do that we are building a brighter future for our country.

The former Liverpool striker and manager, 67, is knighted for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool. Also honoured are screen stars Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley, ex-University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne and rapper Ms Dynamite. The list is full of hundreds of unsung heroes, from counsellors and a Holocaust survivor to Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller. But there are also fatcat bosses of Royal Mail and Network Rail whose gongs are likely to prompt accusations of rewards for failure. Here is the 2018 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List in full.  In total, 1,057 people have received an award. Of the total number recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list this year, 210 have been made an OBE, 392 an MBE, and 318 awarded a BEM. There are always rows over gongs for cronies and the establishment, but 71% of honours went to everyday community heroes. Meanwhile 11% work in education, 12% in health, 13% in industry, 3% in science and technology and 5% in sport. Just under half the recipients (49%) are women, while 10% of all those on the list are from ethnic minorities. The biggest names Kenny Dalglish  Liverpool football legend Kenny Dalglish heads a host of the great and the good receiving gongs in the Queen’s birthday honours. The former striker and manager, 67, who was at Hillsborough when 96 fans were killed in 1989, becomes a knight. The 67-year-old Glaswegian and his wife Marina have helped raise millions of pounds for charity after she successfully battled breast cancer. Sir Kenny joked he thought the letter was from the taxman - and told the Mirror he will still be very much the same person after the honour. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiled.  Jermain Defoe celebrated an OBE by paying tribute to best friend Bradley Lowery, his six-year-old “best friend” who died last year. The former England striker struck up a moving relationship with little Bradley during his time at Sunderland as the lad battled a rare type of cancer. The Premier league star, whose award recognises the work of the Jermain Defoe Foundation in St Lucia, told the Mirror: “It was a special relationship. Over the years playing football, being lucky enough, being blessed and realising you are role models, there are a lot of kids who look up to you.”  Keira Knightley will receive an OBE for her services to drama and charity. The royal honour comes more than 15 years after the twice Oscar-nominated film star scored her breakthrough role as a football-loving teenager in Bend It Like Beckham. Since then, Knightley, 33, has gone on to star in Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually and Pride \u0026amp Prejudice. Emma Thompson  One of Britain\u0027s most acclaimed actresses, Emma Thompson, is made a Dame for services to drama after winning Oscars, Baftas, Golden Globes and Emmys. The 59-year-old has been a star since the 1980s in The Remains Of The Day, Howards End, Harry Potter films and the Nanny McPhee films. Born in 1959 to an acting parents, she studied English at Cambridge and joined comedy troupe Footlights alongside Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. A human rights activist, Greenpeace and Labour supporter, she lives with husband Greg Wise, daughter Gaia, 18, and a son, Tindyebwa Agaba, a Rwandan orphan they informally adopted in 2003 when he was 14. Anthony Joshua  World heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua is made an OBE for services to sport. It is the second honour for the star, who is just 28, after he led a team of Olympic gold medallists receiving MBEs in 2013.  Tom Hardy, who receives a CBE for services to drama, made his name on the big screen with a series of hard man roles. The 40-year-old actor is known for Inception, Mad Max: Fury Road, Bronson and The Revenant. But the privately-educated star has a hard-bitted back story in real life too. He has spoken about how he went off the rails with alcohol addiction, checking himself into rehab in 2003. He\u0027s been clean ever since. I went in thinking I\u0027d do it for a little bit until I can go out and drink and people forgive me. But I did my 28 days, and after listening to people who had been through similar circumstances I realised I did have a problem, he previously told the Mirror. Mark Carne  Network Rail boss Mark Carne – blamed for bungling new timetables which have left passengers stranded and delayed – collects a CBE for services to the rail industry. Meanwhile the number of trains either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) routes averaged 11% and 13% respectively in the first two weeks of the new timetables. Mr Carne said in a statement last week that timetables were finalised “significantly later than normal for reasons that were both within and without our control”. He continued: “It has not been good enough and we know it.” Moya Greene  Another corporate boss accused of being rewarded for failure is Royal Mail chief Moya Greene, who becomes a Dame. The Canadian dubbed “Moneybags Moya” oversaw the 2013 privatisation of the service. In the same year, she was forced to hand back a shocking \u0026pound120,000 housing perk. She was given the money to help her buy a home as part of a lavish \u0026pound1.5million pay and perks package last year. She steps down later this year with almost \u0026pound1million - a cash payment equivalent to 12 months’ base salary, which was \u0026pound547,800 last year, as well as a payment equivalent to her expected annual bonus of \u0026pound367,000. Kazuo Ishiguro Author Kazuo Ishiguro said he is proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions and literary culture after being awarded a knighthood for services to literature - less than a year after winning the Nobel Prize. His acclaimed works include The Remains Of The Day for which he won the Man Booker Prize. The 63-year-old said: I\u0027m deeply touched to receive this honour from the nation that welcomed me as a small foreign boy, that educated me and nurtured me. At this uncertain moment around our globe, I remain proud of Britain, its open, democratic traditions - and its wonderful literary culture in which I\u0027ve been allowed to participate. Ms Dynamite  Rapper and singer Ms Dynamite is honoured with an MBE - under her real name Niomi McLean-Daley. The 37-year-old who burst onto the scene with earworm hit Dy-na-mi-tee in 2002 is recognised for services to music. She retreated from the spotlight in 2006 after being arrested outside a London nightclub and sentenced to community service. Since then she has featured on TV, guest-hosted on BBC radio and appeared on Katy B\u0027s Lights On track. Mark Rowley Following a wave of terror attacks which struck the UK in 2017, former assistant commissioner of the politan Police Mark Rowley, who led the national response, is honoured with a knighthood. On his retirement in March after 31 years in policing Mr Rowley was praised by Prime Minister Theresa May for his dedication to protecting public safety and tackling the evils of terrorism. Politicians  Among the politicians honoured are Conservative deputy Commons speaker Eleanor Laing and Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin, awarded a damehood and a knighthood respectively for their political and public service. Labour\u0027s Louise Ellman has also been made a dame for parliamentary and political services. Britain\u0027s richest billionaire  Britain\u0027s richest billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of chemical company Ineos who is worth \u0026pound21.05 billion, receives a knighthood for services to business and investment. The firm’s Grangemouth refinery was at the centre of the most bitter industrial disputes in recent years when it was threatened with closure in 2013, triggering a major rift with the unions.  Alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick is the youngest on this year\u0027s list, picking up an MBE for services to Paralympic winter Olympic sport. The Welsh star is just 20 but she\u0027s already Britain\u0027s most successful winter paralympian after learning to ski aged five. She gained slalom gold, super combined silver, giant slalom silver and super-G bronze at this year\u0027s Winter Paralympics. The oldest - Britain\u0027s longest-serving poppy seller  Former Second World War nurse Rosemary Powell, who at 103 is the oldest on the list, is made an MBE for voluntary service. She has spent an astonishing 97 years collecting for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal, and announced she will hang up her collecting tin just days ago because she feels she is “getting old”. Rosemary was just six when she began selling the Royal British Legion poppies on Remembrance Day in 1921 – the year the appeal was first held. She said: We did it in memory of those men who were killed – for their sacrifice. Sadly war has had a significant impact on my life.” Best of the rest Renowned war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media, while Stacey Dooley, known for her BBC Three investigative series covering topics ranging from the fight against Isis to the abortion debate, receives an MBE for services to broadcasting. Thriller writer Ken Follett gets a CBE and TV presenter and Britain’s best-known classicist Professor Mary Beard collects a Damehood. Waterstones founder Tim Waterstone is now a Sir. Holocaust survivor Ber Helfgott, also known as Ben, is knighted for services to Holocaust remembrance and education. Chief Scientific Officer for NHS England Professor Susan Hill is made a dame for services to the 100,000 Genome Project and to NHS Genomic Medicine, while surgeon Nadine Hachach-Haram is awarded a BEM for services to surgery and innovation, having co-founded a company pioneering virtual access to surgery for people in remote areas. Judy Naake, who made millions selling St Tropez self-tanning products, initially from the back of her car, receives an MBE for services to entrepreneurship, the community and philanthropy. Jo Malone, creator of the self-titled luxury perfumery brand who has since started the fragrance-centred Jo Loves business, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and the GREAT Britain campaign. But no Grenfell honours this time While there are no honours for local heroes involved in the response to the Grenfell Tower fire, the Cabinet has said it expects acts of bravery and extraordinary community spirit which emerged from the tragedy to feature on future lists, adding that its approach will be time-appropriate.

Spanish police took the man into custody when Easyjet flight EZY6089, from Bristol to Mahon, Menorca, touched down on the runway on Tuesday, June 5. Easyjet said the man behaved in a disruptive manner on board the flight after he had been drinking his own alcohol that had been purchased at Bristol Airport. A spokesperson told BristolLive the budget airline has been lobbying for a ban on the consumption of duty free alcohol on board flights for a long time.   EasyJet Prague stag-do party members \u0027abused staff, swore in front of kids and URINATED on toilet floor\u0027 before flight cancelled  The spokesperson said: Typically it is the alcohol consumed and/or bought in the airport that is the major causal factor of disruption in the air and so we strongly believe that two simple regulatory changes need to be made. First, licensing laws need to be introduced at airports to control the sale of alcohol, bringing airports into line with bars and restaurants on the high, and secondly the consumption of duty free alcohol on-board should be made illegal. The vast majority of passengers who consume alcohol in the airport or on board do so responsibly and we believe that these two measures would protect their interests while reducing the number of disruptive incidents and making flying safer and more enjoyable for all.  A flight from Bristol to Prague was cancelled earlier in the week after a group of men on a stag do treated the plane like a nightclub, as well as adverse weather conditions. An Avon and Somerset Constabulary spokesperson told BristolLive the men were taken off the flight. One member of the group, a 32-year-old man, was later arrested for a public order offence. A witness described their behaviour as digraceful and claimed the group had abused staff on board and urinated on the floor of the front toilet. Members of the stag group reportedly said the cabin crew overreacted and called for them to be sacked following the incident.

Rosemary was honoured just a week after stepping down after 97 years of collecting for the Royal British Legion appeal. She first helped her mother sell poppies for the Royal British Legion’s inaugural Poppy Appeal in 1921 aged only six. The great-gran, from London, plans to hang up her collection tin this year because she is “getting old”. “It is very nice that I have been given this,” she said. “I still vividly remember selling poppies on Richmond Bridge with my mother.” The brother of aid worker David Haines, who was murdered by Islamic State extremists, is made an OBE for his work against terrorism.  Mike Haines dedicated the honour, for voluntary service to tolerance and education in the UK and abroad, to his younger sibling, who was beheaded by Islamic State extremists in 2014 after being taken hostage in Syria. Haines, of Dundee, said: “It means a great deal to me and my family. “Nonetheless, I want to be clear that this award is not about me, but for all those who have supported the Global Acts of Unity campaign and the values it stands for. “Like many of those receiving awards today, I stand on the shoulders of those who support me.

You devoted your life to helping others, and in this I hope you see your mission lives on.”  A nun who has spent almost a decade leading an anti-human trafficking network across Europe hopes her inclusion on the honours list will draw attention to the “terrible crime”. Sister Imelda Poole, president of Religious in Europe Networking Against Trafficking and Exploitation, is made an MBE for services to combating modern slavery. The nun previously spent many years helping vulnerable people in the UK including in Manchester, Glasgow and Middlesbrough. Sister Imelda said: “This is an honour which I accept on behalf of the female religious and co-workers who are contributing, through the mission of many international networks such as RENATE, to combating modern day slavery and on behalf of the dedicated staff of Mary Ward Loreto in Albania who are passionate in this same cause. “May this award expose even further the terrible crime of human trafficking which, as Pope Francis has declared, is a crime against humanity itself.”  A Muslim woman hopes her MBE “silences the haters” who contribute to Islamophobia. Mum-of-three Akeela Ahmed, 39, said last year’s terror attacks fuelled Islamophobia. She added: “I really do hope ... me getting this award will really help women understand that not everybody views Muslim women in that way and actually we’re as much part of this country as anybody else and our achievements are recognised and validated as well and also hope it just kind of silences the haters a bit as well.”  Football legend “King” Kenny Dalglish becomes Sir Kenny as he leads a host of public figures receiving gongs in the Queen’s birthday honours.

Sir Kenny, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 of the team’s fans died, said he was “hugely proud to have accepted the accolade”. The Glaswegian and his wife Marina have also helped raise millions of pounds for cancer treatment through the Marina Dalglish Appeal after she successfully battled breast cancer. It has raised more than \u0026pound10million to set up an oncology centre at University Hospital, Aintree. Joking that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman, he added of the achievement: “We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.”  Newly-knighted Sir Kenny Dalglish saw crown-headed letter land on doormat - and thought it was from the taxman   The citation for the honour specifically referred to his inspirational work in supporting the families of the bereaved Hillsborough victims, and his work in support of the quest for justice, which culminated in a judgement of unlawful killings of the victims. Sir Kenny told of his pride at the recognition for his family, and the people in Liverpool and Scotland who have always supported him. “When I was a young boy in Glasgow I wouldn’t have had the words to give this honour due testimony, but we are hugely proud to have got this and for the people who have worked so hard to get here,” he said. “We are immensely proud as a whole family to have got it but everyone should feel proud because they have all played a very important role in what we’ve done and where we have got to.”  He insisted he will still be very much the same person after the honour, and admitted he will feel strange being addressed as Sir Kenny. “It doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel comfortable. No-one will be calling me that anyway,” he smiles. “I don’t think it makes me any different. It’s for yourself and for everyone who has been associated with you through the years, from your parents to your professional career. “Obviously a lot of people must have pushed my name forward for the accolade, which is hugely humbling but also very gratifying as well.” He also spoke of the pride his mum Cathy and dad Bill would have felt about his incredible journey from Glasgow’s East End where he was born, to Buckingham Palace and a knight of the realm. “As a parent myself if one of my kids went that far you would be hugely proud of them, wouldn’t you? I don’t think they would be any different to anyone else,” he said. “Your parents are the ones who set you off in the world.  “They put you in the right direction or the wrong direction, and thankfully for myself and Marina we got pushed in the right direction. “We met great people from then on in. It doesn’t do you any harm when you meet good people. “It’s just lucky, it’s life’s journey. We’ve been lucky.” Veteran war correspondent Kate Adie is made a CBE for services to media.  Businesswoman Jo Malone, famed for her fragrant candles, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and a campaign encouraging people to visit and invest in the UK.

One of the suspects jumped on the bonnet and kicked in the windscreen during the shocking incident during broad daylight in Finchley, north London. The driver of the car was left with a cut from the knife and ended up in hospital. Dashcam images captured the moment as the two men in the sports car stopped in a queue at traffic lights on the North Circular when two mopeds carrying four thugs rode up on either side. The men were asked to hand over their watches - an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak with a blue face worth more than \u0026pound14,000 and a Fossil watch. One of the muggers then jumped on the bonnet and kicked in the windscreen before the two mopeds rode away just before 6.30pm on Saturday.  But it was only afterwards that the driver, 27, realised he had been cut by the knife and went to hospital.   DC Oliver Kotis from Barnet CID, said: This was a shocking attack on innocent people in broad daylight. We are determined to bring these violent criminals to justice, but we need the help of the community to find and arrest these people. Anyone who either witnessed this crime, was in the area and has dashcam footage, or anyone with any information should contact police immediately. Your information could be vital in bringing these dangerous men to justice. Scotland Yard are appealing for information following the robbery and have released dashcam images of the incident.   A statement from politan Police said: At around 6.25pm on June 2, two men were travelling in a Mazda MX5- RF car on the A406 in Finchley.  Near to the junction with the A1 and Henley\u0027s Corner, the victim’s car was stationary when two mopeds, carrying four male suspects, rode up on either side. The suspects demanded watches from the two victims. One suspect was brandishing a hammer and the other a large \u0027zombie style\u0027 knife. The watches were stolen, an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak with a blue face and a Fossil watch.

Instead, they\u0027re sent to the children\u0027s table with the other little ones.  According to Harper\u0027s Bazaar the royal kids aren\u0027t allowed to sit with the adults until they have learned the art of polite conversation. Well, who wants to sit and listen to boring grow-up chat when you could be speaking to your pals about police cars anyway... And the rules don\u0027t just apply to formal occassions.  Former royal chef Darren McGrady, who worked for the Queen and Diana, said royal children ate their Christmas lunch in the nursery with the nannies.

The 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May, which if left untreated can cause blindness. In recent weeks, the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties. The Queen was reportedly treated as a day patient at the private King Edward VII\u0027s hospital in London. When approached, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: I can confirm that the Queen successfully underwent a short planned procedure to treat a cataract last month.  Cataracts are when the lens, a small transparent disc inside the eye, develops cloudy patches. Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated. Despite her recent surgery, it was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements. The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.  The Queen\u0027s no fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital. It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham. She has since called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.

From children\u0027s author Roald Dahl to film director Alfred Hitchcock, 277 people declined the Queen\u0027s Honours in the New Year or Birthday Honours lists from 1951 to 1999, the Cabinet Office confirmed in 2012. Since that official list of those who had declined honours were first published, it has become increasingly common for celebs to reveal their refusal. Before that, it had been relatively rare to do so. While people have explained their decision to turn down honours in many different ways, a number have cited the honours system’s links to empire. How do you refuse an honour? Nominees are asked by Downing Street if they will accept well in advance, and are usually able to reject the offer without going public. Several personalities said a polite ‘no’ to the Queen on more than one occasion. So who exactly has turned down the Birthday Honours, here we take a look at the big names who have rejected the award. Who has refused Birthday Honours? Back in 2003, a list of living celebs who had refused gongs had been leaked, including David Bowie and Helen Mirren (though she later accepted a damehood). French and Saunders  The comedy pairing turned down OBEs for services to comedy drama in 2001. It was only later they explained. Saunders said: “If I felt I deserved a Damehood I’d accept it,” she told Source magazine. “At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn’t seem right somehow. “We didn’t deserve a pat on the back. It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.” David Bowie  Bowie himself later explained his decision not to join the list of musical knights including Sir Mick Jagger, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. He said: “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I spent my life working for.” When asked about Jagger accepting the honour, he said: “It’s not my place to make a judgment on Jagger, it’s his decision. But it’s just not for me.” Nigella Lawson  The celeb chef turned down the offer of an OBE in 2001, though it\u0027s not known why. Benjamin Zephaniah Poet Benjamin Zephaniah explained his public refusal in 2003. He wrote: “OBE, me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word ‘empire’: it reminds me of slavery, thousands of years of brutality.” “I am not one of those who are obsessed with their roots, and I’m certainly not suffering from a crisis of identity my obsession is about the future and the political rights of all people. “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.” Stephen Hawking  In 2008 Hawking said he had been approached with an offer of a knighthood in the late 1990s, but had turned it down. It was later said it was down to the government\u0027s dealing with science funding and cuts. Paul Weller The musician rejected his CBE in 2006. In a statement his spokesperson said: “Paul was surprised and flattered, but it wasn’t really for him.” Lynn Faulds Wood In 2016, former BBC watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood turned down an MBE and suggested that the honours system needs updating to reflect the modern world. She said: “I would love an honour if it didn’t have the word ‘empire’ at the end of it. We don’t have an empire.” John Cleese  The Monty Python star was offered a CBE in 1996 but said they were silly. He was offered a peerage by Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown in 1999 - he declined because he felt staying in England during the winter months to fulfil his role as a working peer was too much of a price to pay. George Harrison The former Beatle turned an OBE down in 2000 - after Paul McCartnery was awarded a knighthood. Every Beatles member was awarded an MBE in 1965, though Lennon returned him. It\u0027s thought he was put forward for his contribution to music, but there was speculation that Harrison would have been insulted that McCartney got his knighthood three years before. “Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,” friend Roy Connolly told the Independent. “George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.” Ken Loach Ken Loach turned down an OBE in 1977. His films focus on social issues such as poverty and homlessness. He told the Radio Times in 2001. “It’s all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. “I turned down the OBE because it’s not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who’ve got it.” Howard Gayle  Howard Gayle, Liverpool FC’s first black player, also turned down an MBE, saying it would be a \u0027betrayal’ of Africans who suffered as a result of the empire and that his “ancestors would be turning in their graves.” He was nominated for his work with Show Racism the Red Card. Taking to Facebook he said: “This is a decision that I have had to make and there will be others who may feel different and would enjoy the attraction of being a Member of the British Empire and those 3 letters after their name, but I feel that It would be a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.” Jon Snow  Having declined an OBE in 2000, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow went on to make a documentary in 2002 entitled ‘Secrets of the Honours System’. He remains critical of the use of ‘Empire’ in our honours system. “I tried to find out why I’d been given it and was unable to get a clear answer or, indeed, to find out who had proposed me, he said afterwards. Alan Bennett Alan turned down the offer of a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996. The author and playwright said the reason was he couldn\u0027t carry off being a knight. “I felt that, in my case, it just wouldn’t suit me, that’s all. It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life.” Jim Broadbent Jim Broadbent was offered an OBE but he turned it down as he felt it should go to those who help others. In 2012 he said: “I was offered an OBE a couple of years ago, but I said, ‘no’, and turned it down.” “I’m not that comfortable with actors receiving honours, partly because I think they ought to go to those who really help others, he told the . “Besides, I like the idea of actors not being part of the Establishment. “We’re vagabonds and rogues, and we’re not a part of the authorities and Establishment, really. If you mix the two together, things get blurry.” LS Lowry  Lowry declined five honours – an OBE in 1955, CBE in 61, knighthood in 68 and invitations to be a Companion of Honour in 1972 and 76. Friend and fellow artist Harold Riley said when the list was revealed in 2012 that the painter did not have “anything against the system”. He said: “He indicated he didn’t wish to change his situation by something being latched on to him.” Riley said Lowry was a “very private person” and may have wanted to protect his privacy. Danny Boyle Danny Boyle, director and man behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, turned down an honour because he thought it was was wrong. It\u0027s just not me, he said. He added thousands were involved in executing the ceremony. “You can make these speeches about ‘this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah’, he said. “And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people. “I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.” Aldous Huxley Aldous Huxley, author of classic novel Brave New World, snubbed a knighthood in 1959. Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh, who wrote Brideshead Revisited among other famous titles, refused a CBE in the same year. Roald Dahl  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl rejected an OBE in the 1986 New Year’s Honours. Trevor Howard The actor Trevor Howard, star of romance Brief Encounter, would not accept a CBE in 1982. In 1979 the Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan’s wife Audrey refused to be made a Dame. It was the year Mr Callaghan led Labour to defeat against Margaret Thatcher’s Tories. However, Mrs Callaghan later acquired a title when her husband became a peer in 1987. Hughie Green The Opportunity Knocks star Hughie Green refused an OBE in the 1960 New Year’s Honours, when he was at the height of his fame as presenter of Double Your Money. Michael Frayn Author and playwright Michael Frayn turned down a knighthood in 2003, and a CBE in 1999, for a simple reason. He said: “I haven’t done this for reasons of modesty. I like the name Michael Frayn it’s a nice little name to run around with. I’ve spent 70 years getting used to it and I don’t want to change it now.” Ian McDiarmid Ian, known for playing Palpatine in Star Wars, turned down an OBE, but it\u0027s not know why. Prime Ministers  Former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have all declined life peerages. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly declined being created Duke of London because he wished to remain in the House of Commons. Stars who refused an award - but later accepted them  Psycho and The Birds director Hitchcock turned down a CBE in 1962, but accepted a knighthood just before he died. Sculptor Henry Moore, the son of a coal miner, refused a knighthood in 1951, but became a Companion of Honour in 1955. Conversely actor Robert Morley, who accepted an OBE in 1957, rejected a knighthood in the 1975 Birthday Honours list. And Hugh Cudlipp, who edited The Daily Mirror in the 50s and 60s turned down a knighthood in 1966, although he had accepted an OBE in 1945. Artist Lucian Freud declined a CBE in 1977 but went to Downing Street to paint the Queen’s portrait.  Poet Philip Larkin refused an OBE in 1968. Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick turned down a CBE in 1963, before accepting the Order of Merit in 1991. Lenny Henry accepted a CBE from Tony Blair but refused an honour from John Major.

And millions of fans — a few of them men — will tune in tomorrow to BBC One for the return of the hit period piece. Series four promises more close encounters, with even the new doctor stripping to rival the captain’s charms. But Cornish culture buffs, and fans of the books on which the drama is based, will be focusing on the history.  Many will ask: “Who was the real Ross Poldark?” Author Winston Graham, who died 15 years ago at 95, was inspired by real events and characters as he wrote his 12 romantic novels, starting in 1945. He admitted Poldark’s facial scar and “physical characteristics” were based on a injured flying officer he met on a train during the Second World War — but he claimed there was never one real Ross.  Yet there is a historic Cornish character whose life bears striking similarities to the tricorn hat-wearing hero.  And rather worryingly for Aidan Turner fans, his selfless fate would be a dream storyline for TV scriptwriters looking for a shock finale. His name was Thomas Hawkins, a wealthy 18th-cen\u0026shy\u0026shytury mine-owner who cared for workers’ wel\u0026shy\u0026shyfare, just like Poldark. He married for love before he and wife Anne lost two children in tragic circumstances — while Ross and Demelza saw their baby Julia, die from diphtheria. He was also an MP — and viewers will remember that our hero has promised to go into politics to fight for justice. Thomas’s descendant, Michael Galsworthy, who lives on the family’s 300-year-old estate near Truro, cer\u0026shy\u0026shytainly sees the similarities.  And the author told him his characters were based on Cornish “gentry” akin to his ancestors. Michael said: “I met Winston during a lunch. “We were discussing his novels and he explained that he used people like Thomas and Anne Hawkins when creating his characters.” Thomas was born in 1724, son of a leading barrister and public official. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and, at 23, became MP for the Grampound constituency. He inherited the Trewithen estate from his uncle Phillip, also a barrister. Thomas owned lucrative tin mines which employed hundreds of people and took great interest in their welfare. He fell in love with Anne Heywood — a brunette not a redhead like Demelza — whose father agreed they could marry so long as his architect got the job of doing up their mansion. The couple went on to have four sons and one daughter. But tragedy struck when their eldest son John, 13, drowned in the Thames while at Eton.  Thom\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shyas and Anne brought his body home preserved in a barrel of brandy. Their anguish must have matched that portrayed by Turner and co-star Eleanor Tomlinson in harrowing scenes as Ross and Demelza’s daughter died from “putrid throat” in series one. Tragedy struck the Hawkins family a second time when another son died of “a fever in consequence of eating an ice-cream after dancing”. And Thomas’ sense of responsibility for the people who worked for him resulted in his own premature death in 1766 at the age of 42.  At that time, smallpox was a killer but treatment was being developed. Thomas volunteered to have an early form of vaccination as an example to his tenants. Tragically, he contracted the disease and died. His second son Christopher, inherited the estate when just eight years old. He went on to become High Sheriff of Cornwall, an MP and in 1791 was made a baronet by William Pitt the Younger.  Fascinatingly, Sir Christopher became a recurring character in the Poldark novels, depicted as corrupt and cynical but generous to his friends. All Graham’s books were inspired by stories he uncovered in 18th-century newspapers, letters, diaries and autobiographies. He said: “In all classes of historical novels, one has to have a degree of historical truth as well as a truth to human nature.” And he added about his Poldark books: “I do not know how near the truth of life in the 18th century these novels are. All I know is that they are as near to the truth as I can make them.”  Ross links to Battle of Waterloo officer Some fans believe another real-life hero may have influenced the character of Poldark. Ross is a British Army officer and American Revolutionary war veteran who returns to his native Cornwall and becomes an MP. Author Winston Graham’s notes reveal that he researched the life of Lieut Gen Sir Richard Hussey Vivian, a Cornishman, Battle of Waterloo veteran and politician.

Pearl Fernandez, 34, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole while her boyfriend Isauro Aguirre, 37, was sentenced to death for the death of her son Gabriel.  The pair bit, whipped and beat little Gabriel Fernandez in catalogue of horrific attacks at their home in Palmdale, California.  In the months leading up to his death, Gabriel was covered with pepper spray, forced to eat his own vomit, regularly gagged to stop him from speaking and locked in a cabinet when he complained, the court heard.  Fernandez and Isauro also burned him with cigarettes, whipped him, shot him with a BB gun, starved him and fed him cat litter. The boy was kept gagged and bound in a cubby until he was found, a Los Angeles County District Attorney\u0027s Office heard. Before reading their sentences, Judge George G. Lomeli said their conduct was horrendous, inhumane and nothing short of evil.  You want to say that the conduct was animalistic, but that would be wrong because even animals know how to take care of their young, some to the extent that they would sacrifice their own lives in caring for their young, Lomeli said as he stared directly toward Fernandez and Aguirre in the court room, reports ABC .  He then told a touching story of a news report he once watched about a mother cat who kept going into burning building to save her kittens.  Judge Lomeli continued: I can only wish...that in the middle of the night you wake up, and you think of the injuries that you subjected on this poor young man, this poor 7-year-old, and that it tortures you. Last December, the jury recommended that Aguirre be sentence to death after he was convicted of first-degree murder and the special circumstance allegation of murder involving torture. In February, Fernandez pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and admitted to the torture special circumstance allegation in order to get life in prison without parole. If the case had gone to trial and she had been convicted as charged, she would have also been facing the death penalty.  At her sentencing hearing, Fernandez read an apology letter out loud, saying she hopes one day her children can forgive her.   I want to say I\u0027m sorry for what happened. I wish Gabriel was alive. Every day I wish that I\u0027d made better choices. I\u0027m sorry to my children, and I want them to know that I love them, she said.   Gabriel\u0027s brother Ezequiel, who was 12 at the time and is now aged 16, and sister Virginia, who was 11 at the time and is now aged 14, gave heartbreaking evidence last year. Ezequiel said Aguirre would punch and kick the boy and pick him up by the neck until he passed out. The court went silent as a cabinet recovered from the home was rolled in. Ezequiel said the couple nicknamed it \u0027the box\u0027 and would handcuff Gabriel inside for hours on end without food or water. He also saw Aguirre beat Gabriel with a buckle and metal hanger while he was naked. He said his mum and Aguirre would often laugh as they beat the boy together, calling him gay.

SLU has invested in this because it is an important way to potentially contribute significantly to the development of a universal flu vaccine, he added.  Human challenge studies are a way to get a lot of information quicker, with a smaller number of volunteers and less cost than a traditional vaccine study. In a traditional flu study, we vaccinate people and see if their immune systems respond by creating antibodies that fight flu.  In a human challenge study, we vaccinate people, then deliberately challenge their bodies by exposing them to flu to see if they get sick.”  Volunteers as part of this challenge would be given a vaccine or placebo, then intentionally exposed to a strain of the influenza virus. In the 10 days that follow, they are observed closely with blood and lung tests and nose swabs to see if they are infected with the virus and shedding it through bodily secretions.  Nurses are on hand constantly to care for them. And participants are not allowed to go home until show they are negative for infection for two days. The reason they\u0027re quarantined is because it takes time for symptoms to develop and the contagious period to be over.  There is a \u0027clean room\u0027 in the \u0027hotel\u0027 with work spaces for non-volunteers who come and go into the unit.

As well as ensuring you get lots of lovely bids, you also need to make sure it\u0027s an accurate photo so you don\u0027t have to deal with annoying refund or complaints. So when antiques dealer Ian Lawton, 61, wanted to sell an owl ornament on eBay he made sure he took a nice photo. While it\u0027s a lovely shot of the owl, Ian somehow managed to forget to crop out something very x-rated in the background.  His laptop, which is open just behind the model, is showing a porn website containing some very rude photos. Oops. He told the Sun he didn\u0027t notice it and posted it by mistake. He said: Its nothing dodgy. Who doesn\u0027t watch porn? I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the first. The listing was online for a month but it has now been removed.

Vibrator owners in the UK are being warned that they should check laws abroad before travelling as vibrators are banned in some countries. Places such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Maldives have a ban on sex toys and anyone bringing one in to the country would be forced to face the authorities. Sex toy specialists Carvaka have urged people to get all the facts before going away.  They said: We know how much people get attached to their sex toys and so when it comes to heading off on holidays, it can be difficult to think about a week or even a fortnight away from them. However, with a number of countries imposing outright bans on vibrators and dildos, it\u0027s important that people are informed before they travel in order to prevent any issues at the point of entry to that country. Countries where sex toys are banned  1. The Maldives While us Brits may love a trip to the Maldives, basking on expanses of white sand and exploring blue lagoons, a holiday there could end badly if you pack a sex toy in your suitcase. They come under the heading of pornographic material which is completely banned by the Maldives Customs Service.  2. Saudi Arabia Sex toys also fall under the category of pornographic material in Saudi Arabia and could be confiscated.  Supposedly even massagers which look immoral are banned. 3. Malaysia The Malaysian Penal Code states that anyone who sells, distributes or possesses an obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure, or any other obscene object whatsover... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 4. The United Arab Emirates While the UAE is filled with impressive skyscrapers and beach resorts, it would be difficult to find a sex toy as they are prohibited.  Gulf news reported in 2010 that a woman was stopped after her child\u0027s phallic swimming aid was mistaken for a sex toy.

Amber Luke, 23, from Australia, says she\u0027s been addicted to tattoos since she was 16 and now has more than 50 - including ones on her eyeballs. She\u0027s even had her tongue split in two and had her earlobes stretched in an incredible body transformation. The young woman says she has no regrets whatsoever about her extreme makeover.  Amber - dubbed \u0027Blue Eyes White Dragon\u0027 told Daily Mail Australia that she\u0027s absolutely in love with my image. She said: I got the name \u0027Blue Eyed White Dragon\u0027 from my friends, they call me that because I resemble a dragon with my eyes and tongue. I see myself as very plain looking when looking at before and after photos, I absolutely hated the way I used to look. I was boring. Amber frequently shares pictures of her unusual look with her 21,000 Instagram followers and says she got her first tattoo seven years ago. She said: As soon as I turned 16, I was inspired by those around me to get tattooed. I craved to know what the feeling was like.  I developed an addiction at 16 years of age. By the time I hit 18, I already had three tattoos. And when I turned 18, I decided to get my first big piece. Now, I have over 50 tattoos, I haven\u0027t been able to count all of them. Clearly determined to achieve her desired look, Amber even risked going blind to have the whites of her eyes tattooed. She revealed: The procedure for getting my eyes done was only 40 minutes. It was very intense and very painful. My eyes got held open while a syringe was injected into my eye four times per eye. I was blind for three weeks.

Ms Kenyon, who was living with her grandmother at the time, subsequently blocked Tosh’s number.The court was told Ms McVicar received an abusive video message from Tosh on January 19, described as “rambling.”Both women were upset by this, and contacted police.The court heard the messages had been intended to be “a joke”, but Tosh “appreciated this was not how it came across”.He admitted that on various occasions between January 15 and 19, he sent grossly offensive text messages to Ms Kenyon which were indecent, obscene or menacing in character in that he repeatedly referred to her in offensive and abusive terms and threatened to expose intimate photographs of her.He further admitted that he sent text and video messages to Ms McVicar that were grossly offensive or indecent, obscene or menacing in character, shouted, swore and used offensive and abusive language.Sheriff John Rafferty said: “You have two recently analogous matters on your record in 2012 and 2013.“You have also breached bail opportunities on six occasions.

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and

for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s search for new centre-backs continues apace as former Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren and ex-Tannadice man Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both city clubs heading to Glebe Park in pre-season because it’s the only grass pitch in the area, apart from Arbroath.n Former Dundee United favourite Nadir Ciftci is leaving Celtic at the end of this

We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

We would fully expect this to be appropriate to the scale and seriousness of the unauthorised works undertaken.”In his report Mike Galloway, executive director of city development, lays out the arguments for and against the three possible options.The report notes that: “The unauthorised demolition of a Listed Building is a significant breach of National Legislation as reinforced through the comments by Historic Environment Scotland. Taking no further action is not considered to be an appropriate response”.Under consideration of serving an Enforcement Notice the report says it would not be an appropriate course of action because the building: “…has now been completely demolished and materials removed from the site”. Any restoration would not be reasonably practicable.When looking at whether to recommend reporting the matter to the Procurator Fiscal Mr Galloway’s report says: “There was frequent correspondence between council officers and the owner’s representatives late in 2017.“The information that was provided by the owner’s representatives, in the opinion of Dundee City Council engineers, clearly confirmed that while defects were present, demolition was not the only option to preserve safety or indeed the building.”It goes on: “Given the nature and the lack of notification or contact with Dundee City Council prior to the commencement of the demolition process, it is considered that this displays a disregard for the statutory process.”The report therefore recommends that Dundee City Council reports the matter to the Procurator Fiscal.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  The council chief who approved   235K Rolls Royce gift for Lord Provost","story":"                          By Alan Ferguson and Stewart Paterson"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7890718.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  Complete setlist for Jay-Z and Beyonc   ahead of Glasgow gig","story":"                          THE setlist for Jay-Z and Beyonc\u0026eacute\u0027 first gig of their UK tour has been unveiled."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7891710.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  Ed Sheeran and Anne-Marie s flying visit to popular Glasgow bar","story":"                          ED SHEERAN played three nights at Hampden Park but nobody knew he played for real on his final night right outside the Evening Times HQ.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7823436.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Marks   Spencer to close popular Glasgow City Centre branch","story":"                          RETAILER Marks \u0026amp Spencer will close one of their food outlets in Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7892436.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"First look at the full-scale sets when massive Friends tour comes to Glasgow","story":"                          THESE images show what Friends fans can expect when the massive UK tour of the hit comedy show hits Glasgow in a month\u0027 time."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7893060.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=94\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"West End streets in lockdown as runners prepare for a sizzling Women s 10k","story":"                          RUNNERS taking part in this weekend\u0027 women\u0027 10k in Glasgow are being advised to prepare for a warm race."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7893414.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SNP conference marks new push for independence says Nicola Sturgeon","story":"                          THE SNP conference over the next two days marks the start of a new push towards independence, according to Nicola Sturgeon."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7699093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ultimate gin festival with unlimited tastings coming to Glasgow","story":"                          THE ultimate gin festival with unlimited tastings has been lined up to hit Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7897782.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":" Get ready for a second vote   New SNP depute s message to Scottish independence supporters","story":"                          New SNP depute leader Keith Brown has called on independence supporters to \"get ready\" for a second vote on Scotland\u0027s future."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7899051.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Road closures for the Glasgow Great Women s 10k you need to know about this weekend","story":"                          The Great Woman\u0027s 10k is coming to Glasgow this weekend and will be bringing with it a number of road closures."},{"url":null,"title":"Britain  39 s most overpriced property  Tiny   39 rabbit hutch  39  house with just two rooms sells for whopping amount","story":"                          A \u0027RABBIT hutch\u0027 house with just two rooms has sold for a whopping \u0026pound280,000 -

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors.

But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe.

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils practice as kintyre music festival approaches","story":"The school-aged children compete for 28 trophies in various piping, drumming, brass, woodwind, strings and vocal classes in the contest which kicks off on Monday, June 4.The competitions will be held in the Argyll Hotel, Kirk Street Hall, Lorne and Lowland Hall and the Victoria Hall, with the grand concert, on Saturday, June 9 at 7.30pm, in Lorne and Lowland Church.The four adjudicators this year are: Kirsteen Grant MA, BMus Keith Hamilton Dip MusEd, LTCL, LRAM, ARCM, LTCL (CMT) Colin Whitelaw, piping and Mark Leishman, pipe band drumming.Now retired, Ms Grant has had a varied career in music.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The minimum owners\u0026#8217 contribution for each unit was £5,000. After a lengthy period he sold all of his flats.\u0026#8216Council officers, due to their breadth of experience of historic building repair, have gone way beyond their nominal roles to help the association and stop the project falling to pieces.\u0026#8217HES approved the council’s CARS bid in January 2015.  During the next three years, the association came up with £101,000 between them.The association was awarded a CARS grant of £383,000, which included £306,000 from HES and a private sector housing grant £141,000 making a total project value of £625,000.A council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216CARS money was ring-fenced for the scheme but had to be committed by March 2018.\u0026#8217Shortly after the cash was guaranteed,  the association appointed  a firm of Glasgow conservation architects, ZM Architecture Ltd., to lead a consultation team to scope, survey and cost the scheme.The repair project has three parts: high level repairs including roofing, leadwork and rainwater goods, extensive stone repairs and the replacement of the rear walkways and failing amenity deck.A council spokesperson added: \u0026#8216Although the building is not covered by statutory listing it is considered of historical importance and occupies a key location in the town centre.\u0026#8217After 12 months of development work the works were put out to tender and five quotes were obtained.Glasgow conservation specialists John Fulton  (Plumbers) Ltd was appointed. The firm is expected to use a number of Kintyre sub-contractors.An incident in July 2015, when a teenager narrowly escaped death, illustrated the urgent need for repairs.The 12-year-old boy fell, about 20 feet into the shop below through the rotten decking skylight, while taking part in the latest craze \u0026#8211 free running \u0026#8211 popularised in films such as Casino Royale.For more on the regeneration of Campbeltown see an Argyll and Bute Council feature on pages 14 and 15.George McMillan looks into the hole in his roof in 2015. 25_c30roof01The timber rooflight structure, on the leaky deck, after the 2015 incident.  25_c30roof03Scaffolding is erected at 22 to 30 Main Street.  NO_c23cars10_scaffold_erectionLast week scaffolding was erected through the deck area.  NO_c23cars11_scaffold_through_deckThe full deck area.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important.

A poll of deputy heads and principal teachers found nearly two thirds either \u0026ldquodisagreed or \u0026ldquostrongly disagreed when asked whether they wanted to become a headteacher - up from some 50 per cent last year.  The Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS), which conducted the survey, said the findings highlighted a \u0026ldquosignificant leaning towards uncertainty about seeking headship roles.  The same survey went on to highlight the main concerns of headteachers as being workload, bureaucracy and lack of teaching and support staff.  On average headteachers said they were working more than 55 hours a week - twenty more hours than they are contracted for.  Read more: Schools struggle to recruit headteachers  Members of the union who submitted written responses identified a range of concerns with one stating: \u0026ldquoI have the headship qualification, but do not want the stress of headship.  Another said: \u0026ldquoI cannot see how I could become a headteacher without it being detrimental to my own family life.  One headteacher who had been in the post for a decade said they had stepped down due to family circumstances citing a lack of work life balance.  The survey comes as the Scottish Government prepares to give more powers to headteachers under a new Education Bill.  Read more: Rushing Headteachers\u0027 Charter could be \u0027disastrous\u0027  The legislation will usher in a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter which will enable heads to shape the curriculum, decide on how funding is allocated and select staff.  The rationale is a concern that decision-making by councils can be divorced from what is required at school level.  However, critics argue the proposals will increase school bureaucracy and make headteachers a lightening rod for any criticisms and concerns about standards making the job even more stressful.  Greg Dempster, general secretary of the AHDS, said international research proved how important high quality school leadership was.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat our survey tells us very clearly is that, due to a lack of resources or an excess of expectations, our school leaders are finding themselves diverted into front line roles or back-room bureaucracy.  \u0026ldquoThat prevents them from getting to the core of the leadership role of engaging with pupils, parents and staff in pursuit of school improvement.  \u0026ldquoThe current situation is putting many high quality candidates off headship, so the already poor recruitment position continues to worsen.

After weeks of internal negotiations and even suggestions of a threatened resignation from David Davis, Theresa May finally got agreement with her Cabinet\u0026rsquos leading Brexiteers.  This followed three separate early morning meetings in her Commons office with Mr Davis and his colleagues Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, which were described as \u0026ldquoconstructive. No 10 made clear none of them had threatened to resign.  Asked if the Prime Minister was confident Brussels would accept the \u0026ldquofudged back-stop plan, her deputy spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot recognise that word but it\u0026rsquos important to say the EU put forward their proposal and we were clear\u0026hellipthat was unacceptable this is our counter-proposal. We look forward to discussing it further with the EU.  As the so-called Brexit War Cabinet later met in Downing Street, before Mrs May jetted off for the G7 summit in Canada, the Government published its technical note on its back-stop plan.  This is the time-limit, which Mr Davis had wanted inserted its omission in the draft had angered the Secretary of State, raising speculation he might quit.  A source close to the Secretary of State explained: \"The back-stop paper has been amended and now expresses, in much more detail, the time-limited nature of our proposal something the PM and David Davis have always been committed to.\"  However, political opponents seized on the key lines in the document, pointing out how it was not a guaranteed back-stop at all and it referred only to how the UK Government \u0026ldquoexpects the preferred customs option to be in place by December 2021 33 months from the start of Brexit in March 2019.  The Government believes it will never need the back-stop plan - the legal guarantee to maintain frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u0026ndash as it is confident of coming up with its preferred customs option post-Brexit.  The European Commission says both options are unworkable.  No 10 was unable to give any clear indication as to how the internal consideration of the two options was going or whether or not Mrs May and her colleagues were any nearer to choosing one or the other.  At Westminster, Labour\u0026rsquos Chris Leslie was dismissive, saying: \"After weeks of the Government negotiating with itself, the fudged document they have produced doesn\u0027t engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas and is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU.\"  His party colleague Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said Mrs May had \"signed up to a flawed proposal, which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments\".  He added: \u0026ldquoThe PM should urgently rethink her decision and back Labour\u0026rsquos call for a new comprehensive customs union and new deal with the single market after Brexit.  In Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, was downbeat.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, also took to social media to welcome the Government\u0026rsquos back-stop plan but said there were three questions: \u0026ldquoIs it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?  Nigel Dodds of the DUP stressed how the back-stop plan \u0026ldquoapplies to the entire United Kingdom that is positive and a step forward.

But now it appears that House of Fraser\u0026rsquos best days are behind it following an announcement that it is to close more than half of its stores, including its Edinburgh shop on Princes Street and its Oxford Street store in London, with the loss of 6,000 jobs UK-wide.  The chain said the planned closures are vital to secure the future of the brand, which began life in Glasgow in 1849.  And while House of Fraser has endured turbulent times in the past, experts say the threat of administration is still looming if the rescue plan does not succeed.  The chain is one of a number of former giants of the high street which have struggled to cope with changing consumer habits, the rise of the internet and the high cost of running \u0026ldquobricks and mortar stores.  The decision to shut stores comes as part of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u0026ndash a controversial insolvency procedure in vogue among struggling retailers. If the CVA is approved by landlords, it will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  The group said it also has plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \u0026ldquosecure House of Fraser\u0026rsquos future, although its flagship Buchanan Street shop will stay open.  Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, said: \u0026ldquoOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business.  \u0026ldquoSo whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.  House of Fraser is one of the oldest chains in the UK, with a history stretching back almost 200 years to a single shop in Glasgow.  It began life when James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened a drapery and haberdashery business on the corner of Buchanan Street which would eventually move into the lavish building which occupies the site today.  But it was under Hugh Fraser\u0026rsquos grandson, Hugh Fraser III, that the chain really took off. Inheriting the business at the age of 21, Hugh, later Lord Fraser of Allander, began expanding by buying regional store groups Arnott \u0026amp Co and Robert Simpson \u0026amp Sons.  On his death in 1966, his son, also called Hugh, continued growing the business beyond its humble roots, buying out more than 50 companies.  However, his time in charge came to an end in the 1970s when he was engulfed by an insider trading scandal, said to have been fuelled by his gambling addiction.  House of Fraser then passed through several hands, and now Hamleys owner, the Chinese firm C.banner, is being lined up to buy a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  But its cash injection is pledged only on the condition the retailer can agree the CVA restructuring.  Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG, which is handling the CVA, warned of dire consequences if that does not go ahead.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.  Leigh Sparks, Deputy Principal and Professor of Retail Studies at the Institute for Retail Studies, University of Stirling, said that House of Fraser was one of a number of chains struggling to stay relevant in the modern age.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere are other department stores which have gone by the wayside and it is a format which is not as popular with customers as it used to be.  \u0026ldquoMany of the products department stores sell can now be found in other shops on the high street for online for cheaper, and they are just not the draw they used to be.  \u0026ldquoThere are flagship department stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges, where the footfall is still enough to sustain them but House of Fraser is not in that bracket.  David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, added: \u0026ldquoThis is further evidence of how the retail industry is going through a period of profound transformation driven by changes in shopping habits, weak growth in wages, and rising public policy induced costs. This is upending many retail business models, and that can be painful for the firms involved and for their staff.  \u0026ldquoThe industry is in the midst of a hugely challenging period and retailers are adapting and trying to reinvent themselves. What is clear is that the retail industry will look very different in the future. This will have implications for public policy, particularly for employment prospects in communities more reliant on retail jobs, for our town centres and for future revenues from taxes on property."},{"url":null,"title":"Happy birthday for Mackintosh with first glimpse of tea rooms restoration","story":"              FROM the moment you walk through the door, the touch of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest architect, designer and artist is everywhere.  Every high-backed chair is precisely lacquered, each window handle and umbrella stand a work of art in itself. On the tables, cucumber sandwiches, crisp white napkins and Willow-patterned cups and saucers hark back to a more elegant age. Welcome to afternoon tea Charles Rennie Mackintosh style.  Yesterday was the Glasgow-born artist\u0026rsquos 150th birthday and it marked a double celebration as guests including the city\u0026rsquos Lord Provost Eva Bolander were given a sneak preview of the stunning restoration and recreation of one of his greatest works.  Four years after an ambitious plan was created to bring the original Willow Tea Rooms Building in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, back to its former glory, the scale and success of the project was revealed. Hundreds of craftspeople from as far afield as Chicago, Hong Kong, Cumbria and Kirkcaldy have worked to meticulously restore and recreate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos original vision. And it is magnificent.  Mackintosh at the Willow as it will be known (the Willow Tea Rooms name is owned by Anne Mulhern, who runs another cafe just yards away) won\u0026rsquot open to the public till 02 July. But it is worth the wait.  As well as a 200-seat tearoom and restaurant, a place to discover and rediscover the work of Mackintosh, there will be a visitor\u0026rsquos centre as well as exhibition, retail, conference and education space, creating a cultural and community hub. Elements of the site will open throughout the summer.  The Willow Tea Room Trust, which conceived and co-ordinated the \u0026pound10m renovation, hopes to welcome at least 360,000 visitors a year, providing a boost to tourism in a part of the city centre that has declined in recent years, not least after the recent fire on Sauchiehall Street.  Conceived as a a social enterprise, it already provides training and work for 40 staff, many of them young people involved in the Princes Trust charity. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will also have a base at the site.  The original Willow Tea Rooms, opened in October 1903, was one of a series commissioned by Glasgow entrepreneur Miss Catherine Cranston, and the only one created by Mackintosh \u0026ndash her partner in design - in its entirety, from the architecture of the building to the furniture and cutlery. It also featured stunning panels by Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife, the designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and is recognised as one of the finest complete Art Nouveau schemes in the world.  The expert team behind the renovation project worked mainly from black and white photographs contained in an art periodical to get every aspect of the interior detail right. And the woman behind the transformation is delighted with the result.  \u0026ldquoThis is such a happy day, said Celia Sinclair, chair of the Trust. \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark heritage restoration and re-creation that is all about engaging the next generation of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. It\u0026rsquos also about instilling civic pride in Glasgow folk.  \u0026ldquoI hope Mackintosh and Miss Cranston would be pleased by what we have done, and I rather suspect they would love what we are trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoMackintosh was neglected by his fellow Scots during his own time and I was amazed by the lack of interest when I originally approached various organisations over this project. But four years on this is an exciting new beginning. Toshie, your day has come.  Pamela Robertson, Professor Emerita of Mackintosh Studies at the University of Glasgow, a member of the expert panel who oversaw the renovation, described the day as a \u0026ldquomilestone in the history of the building.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis was a journey of discovery for all of us. The Willow was undoubtedly Mackintosh\u0026rsquos finest commission for Miss Cranston and has been extremely challenging for us to reinstate. But the analysis of the photographs has allowed us to re-engage with the textures and forms of this stunning design, to really see what Mackintosh envisioned."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP support on increase  poll finds","story":"              Support for the SNP has increased to 40% and could see the party pick up another eight seats at Westminster, according to a new poll.

Despite the SNP and Tories both growing in support by 4% since January, a seat projection from the poll gave the SNP 43 MPs - up from the current 35 - but saw the Tories drop two seats to 11.
