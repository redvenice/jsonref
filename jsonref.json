We fell in love and honestly, her love was too much for me to handle. It was a lot to handle, to take in.\u0027 \u0027As time went on our relationship took so many changes from being boyfriend and girlfriend, to being lovers, to being best friends.

I\u0027m not like, Oh, she\u0027s not here. People leave in the physical. But their energy, their vibration, their frequency, it lives on forever.\u0027  He then thanked the crowd for coming before addressing Porter herself. \u0027Kim, we\u0027re going to miss you so much,\u0027 Diddy said. \u0027But I ain\u0027t going to miss you too much because I\u0027m not going to let your voice inside of me stop talking.\u0027\u0027I know you like to talk to me a lot once you get on those rants,\u0027 he added as the crowd laughed. \u0027I just want you to know, I\u0027m going to be listening,\u0027 Diddy continued. \u0027We love you, we appreciate you, to all the words I\u0027m forgetting, to everything I\u0027m forgetting to say, we love you Kim.

Mr Roeg also directed the 1990 film The Witches, which starred Jasen Fisher and Anjelica HustonThe late David Bowie starred in Roeg\u0027s 1976 cult classic The Man Who Fell To Earth as an alien who crashes on Earth seeking a way to save his home planet from extinction.It was Bowie\u0027s first major film role and is one of Roeg\u0027s most celebrated works.His 1980 psychological thriller Bad Timing - starring Art Garfunkel, Harvey Keitel and Roeg\u0027s second wife Theresa Russell - caused considerable controversy, with an executive of its own British distributor The Rank Organisation famously branding it \u0027a sick film made by sick people for sick people.\u0027Mr Roeg directed the 1990 screen adaptation of Roald Dahl\u0027s The Witches, working with Muppet-maestro Jim Henson.          He also worked on Doctor Zhivago in the mid 1960s alongside David Lean, but was fired and didn\u0027t receive a creditThe director\u0027s last feature film was Puffball in 2007, a supernatural drama starring Kelly Reilly and Miranda Richardson.Mr Roeg also directed a number of TV series in the late 1980s and early 90s, including a televised adaption of Joseph Conrad\u0027s Heart Of Darkness in 1994.In 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg\u0027s importance in the industry by naming Don\u0027t Look Now and Performance as the 8th and 48th greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 poll.Mr Roeg was awarded with a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1994 and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2011.He has four children, Waldo, Nico, Sholto and Luc, with actress Susan Stephen, whom he orced in 1977.He also has two children with his second wife, American actress Theresa Russell.The director married Harriet Harper in 2005.BREAKING Nicholas Roeg dead: The Man Who Fell to Earth director dies aged 90 - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Princess Charlene Monaco hugs fellow countryman F1 driver Charles Leclerc Abu Dhabi","story":"    Princess Charlene of Monaco hugs F1 driver Charles Leclerc at the Sauber garages during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix today          Leclerc, 21, was born in Monaco and will drive for Ferrari in the 2019 racing seasonNext week the young racer will have his first test drive with Ferrari since he was confirmed for their 2019 season and said he expects it to be \u0027emotional,\u0027 reports Autosport. The outing in the Pirelli tyre test at the Yas Marina Circuit has been a formality for a while, but it wasn\u0027t officially confirmed until recently.Leclerc said: \u0027It will be quite emotional...I\u0027m definitely looking forward to trying it.Royally thankful!

It avoids the disruption and uncertainty that no-deal would bring.It ends free movement once and for all. Instead, we will introduce an immigration system based on skills this country needs – not on the country people come from, but on what they can contribute to the UK.It ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. We will make our own laws in our own Parliaments. It will protect the rights of EU citizens already living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. It will ensure a fair settlement on our financial obligations – the so-called ‘orce bill’ – less than half what some expected.And it will meet our commitment to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and no customs border in the Irish Sea.As the Prime Minister made clear, this agreement is explicit about how determined both the UK and the EU are to avoid using the backstop altogether by getting the future relationship in place by January 2021. Let’s not lose sight of the fact that the backstop is deeply unattractive to the European Union. And importantly, there is a commitment in black and white to consider arrangements which could avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.We recognise that of course compromises have had to be made, but they’ve been made on both sides to deliver an agreement that works in all our interests.It is now up to MPs to decide whether to approve this deal. Politicians on all sides are preparing to make a decision which will shape our country’s relationship with the EU for generations. And EU leaders have made it clear that there is no other deal on the table.We have a deal within our grasp that delivers on the referendum, while protecting jobs and the integrity of the United Kingdom.Let’s get on with it.

The “if”, “how” and “when” of the country’s withdrawal from the European Union, after decades of membership, has understandably dominated news coverage, and sidelined almost every other policy debate. Lost in the mix, for example, has been any serious discussion of how the UK should boost productivity and competitiveness at a time of global economic and financial fluidity.At the same time, the rest of the world’s interest in Brexit has understandably waned. The UK’s negotiations with the EU have dragged on through multiple déjà vu moments, and the consensus is that the economic fallout will be felt far more acutely in Britain than in the EU, let alone in countries elsewhere.Still, the rest of the world is facing profound challenges of its own. Political and economic systems are undergoing far-reaching structural changes, many of them driven by technology, trade, climate change, high inequality and mounting political anger. In addressing these issues, policymakers around the world would do well to heed the lessons of the UK’s Brexit experience.Experts also predicted that the UK economy would suffer an immediate and significant fall in output following the 2016 referendum. In the event, they misunderstood the dynamics of what economists call a “sudden stop” – that is, abrupt, catastrophic dysfunction in a key sector of the economy. A perfect example is the 2008 global financial crisis, when financial markets seized up as a result of operational dislocations and a loss of mutual confidence in the payments and settlement system.Brexit was different. Because you cannot replace something with nothing, there was no immediate break in British-EU trade. In the absence of clarity on what type of Brexit would ultimately materialise, the economic relationship simply continued “as is,” and an immediate disruption was averted.It turns out that when making macroeconomic and market projections for Brexit so far, “short versus long” has been more important than “soft versus hard” (with “hard” referring to the UK’s full, and most likely disorderly, withdrawal from the European single market and customs union). The question is not whether the UK will face a considerable economic reckoning, but when.Nonetheless, the UK economy is already experiencing slow-moving structural change. There is evidence of falling foreign investment and this is contributing to the economy’s disappointing level of investment overall. Moreover, this trend is accentuating the challenges associated with weak productivity growth.There are also signs that companies with UK-based operations have begun to trigger their Brexit contingency plans after a prolonged period of waiting, planning, and more waiting. In addition to shifting investments out of the UK, firms will also start to relocate jobs. And this process will likely accelerate even if Theresa May manages to get her proposed exit deal through parliament.The Brexit process thus showcases the risks associated with economic and political fragmentation, and provides a preview of what awaits an increasingly fractured global economy if this continues: namely, less efficient economic interactions, less resilience, more complicated cross-border financial flows, and less agility. In this context, costly self-insurance will come to replace some of the current system’s pooled-insurance mechanisms. And it will be much harder to maintain global norms and standards, let alone pursue international policy harmonisation and coordination.Tax and regulatory arbitrage are likely to become increasingly common as well. And economic policymaking will become a tool for addressing national security concerns (real or imagined). How this approach will affect existing geopolitical and military arrangements remains to be seen.Lastly, there will also be a change in how countries seek to structure their economies. In the past, Britain and other countries prided themselves as “small open economies” that could leverage their domestic advantages through shrewd and efficient links with Europe and the rest of the world. But now, being a large and relatively closed economy might start to seem more attractive. And for countries that do not have that option – such as smaller economies in east Asia – tightly knit regional blocs might provide a serviceable alternative.The messiness of British party politics has made the Brexit process look like a domestic dispute that is sometimes inscrutable to the rest of the world. But Brexit holds important lessons for and about the global economy. Gone are the days when accelerating economic and financial globalisation and correlated growth patterns went almost unquestioned. We are also in an era of considerable technological and political fluidity. The outlooks for growth and liquidity will likely become even more uncertain and ergent than they already are.• Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and was chairman of Barack Obama’s Global Development Council"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7843521634dd1325179d529bb8fbbd62f4ca33d7/0_121_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4989e866aab08a9f716ce81247841f78","title":"cyber monday uk weekend sales spend over 7bn black friday","story":"Millions of bargain hunters are expected to go online, dealing further blow to the high streetShoppers in Britain were poised to carry on splashing the cash into Cyber Monday, with some forecasts suggesting they planned to spend more than £7bn across Black Friday and the online shopping day.Millions of bargain hunters are expected to go online on Monday to take advantage of generous  bargains, dealing a further blow to the struggling high street as the Christmas shopping bonanza takes off.“Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become a staple fixture of the calendar year and an important one for many retailers,” said a BRC spokesman. “While it is too early to say how retailers have fared on Black Friday itself, we expect the weeks surrounding Black Friday to show some growth on last year.

Those keen to bag a bargain expected to spend an estimated £220 each on Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales this year – a significant decrease from last year, where the Finder study found the average shopper planned to spend £304 in the sales.The traditional midnight cut-off point on Monday is also gradually disappearing, with some retailers running a Cyber Week, extending into December.Argos will launch further deals for Cyber Monday, offering customers the opportunity to bag a bargain across thousands of homeware and furniture products.Available on Monday and Tuesday, the deals extend across lighting, textiles and furniture products."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7825b376f4891197fcf7369ab4f61569ec875d4/0_847_6357_3815/master/6357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be3f95bde30aa44cf50d21b12f3ca1d","title":"deported rogue trader kweku adoboli first time free seven years home office ghana","story":"Kweku Adoboli has received a warm welcome in Ghana but badly misses his old life in UKWhen Kweku Adoboli’s Kenya Airways flight touched down at Accra’s Kotoka international airport he was so dazed and confused he barely noticed the tropical temperatures, the spectacular palm trees or the rich, red bauxite earth of the country of his birth.He had spent the first four hours of his flight from London Heathrow weeping about everything he had lost in the UK and the manner of his final parting from the country he had spent most of his life in.After seven years of fighting the Home Office’s plans to deport him, the end of the road was swift and brutal. He was not even allowed to say goodbye to his loved ones.Adoboli was arrested and detained two weeks ago, was deported two days later with no written notice from the Home Office about which flight he was going to board, and arrived back in Ghana, where he had not lived since the age of four, the following day.“They did a bait and switch on the tarmac at Heathrow,” he says. “They indicated I would be boarding one plane then at the very last moment they forced me on to another so I couldn’t alert friends and family to what was happening.”Adoboli moved to the UK at the age of 12 and boarded at Ackworth School, a Quaker establishment near Pontefract in West Yorkshire, before studying for a degree in computer science and management at Nottingham University.The former UBS trader was jailed for seven years in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud that cost the bank $2.3bn (£1.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence.In Accra he received a warm and enthusiastic welcome not only from family and friends but from the wider community.“In Ghana the concept of restorative justice exists, something that seems absent in the UK. People here are saying to me: ‘We need your skills, let’s get you back into the community. It’s not right or fair the way you were treated in the UK. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves.’”He is staying with his father, John Adoboli, a retired diplomat, in a suburban neighbourhood in Tema, a thriving port city about 15 miles from the capital that is twinned with the London borough of Greenwich. In contrast to the often chilly and grey UK weather, temperatures rarely dip below 30C (86F) and most months Ghanaians enjoy more than 200 hours of sunshine.While Adoboli is at pains to emphasise his love for the country of his birth, for his family there and for the wider Ghanaian community, the UK has been his home for the past 26 years and he identifies with British culture and values.He has built up a wide support network in Britain, with a core of 25 close friends including his girlfriend, Alice Gray, his friends Pippa Scott and Roland Verhaaf and their two sons aged three and five. Adoboli lived with Scott and Verhaaf in Scotland for more than three years after being released from prison.“This is not about not liking Ghana,” he says of his seven-year battle against deportation. “It is about what has been taken away from me in the UK.”As well as his loyal friends, from school, university and other areas of his life, he is mourning no longer being able to enjoy the seasons. “I’m missing seeing the end of autumn and I won’t see the promise of spring,” he says.He left the UK with just a small rucksack he had packed when he went to report at a Home Office centre in Glasgow where he was arrested prior to deportation.“I don’t have much use for my waxed Barbour coat here,” he says. “It’s hanging in the wardrobe. I need to get some more T-shirts though.”Adoboli is not the only one who is distraught. Scott, Verhaaf and their children are feeling his absence keenly. Most of his belongings accumulated over 26 years of living in the UK remain in his bedroom in their home. The children do not understand why he is no longer there.“We told them Kweku is staying with his parents. The three-year-old said: ‘Oh OK let’s go and see him there then,’ and went to put on his shoes and coat,” says Scott.“Kweku doesn’t fit the materialistic banker stereotype,” she adds. “He has left behind lots of books, novels and classics, some clothes and his running shoes. Oh, and his toothbrush. On a whiteboard in the bedroom his notes about work he was doing on his Home Office and legal case are still there.”Their older child has started learning to read and every night reads the list of words given by school to practise down the phone to Adoboli.One item left in his old bedroom is a medal from the Queen he received after a three-day training session with UK and US special forces on counter-terrorism. He was one of several guest speakers along with Tony Blair and he travelled in a helicopter with the former prime minister.The event was organised through the Forward Institute, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society, which Adoboli has been working with. On the three-day development course he was asked to speak about learning from failure and risk-taking in highly complex situations. The medal and a bottle of whisky were his reward.Four days later, at the beginning of September, he was arrested and detained. The irony of one arm of the Home Office treating him royally while another detained and deported him is not lost on Adoboli and his friends.While he is still in a state of shock and grief about his removal from the UK and the forced separation from his loved ones, he is relieved to no longer be living under the yoke of the Home Office. “It’s the first time I have felt free in seven years,” he says. “The Home Office destroys lives. Destroys lives.”The Home Office said it did not comment on inidual cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65401c519881f0f2926f2ab839592431ed8b776e/24_18_3874_2324/master/3874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=821dd17d1bebe0504b563a5b30269790","title":"nflation targets economy home values investments","story":"They aim to promote stability, but might actually increase uncertainty about real things like home values or investmentsIn many countries, inflation has become so low and stable in recent decades that it appears to have faded into the woodwork. Whereas galloping inflation was once widely viewed as the number one economic problem, today most people – at least in the developed countries – hardly ever talk about it or even pay attention to it. But “silent inflation” still has subtle effects on our judgment, and it may still lead to some consequential mistakes.Since New Zealand’s central bank set the first example in 1989, monetary authorities around the world have increasingly pursued a policy of setting inflation targets (or target ranges) that are substantially above zero. That is, policymakers plan to have inflation, but steady inflation. What used to be a dirty word is now announced publicly, and moderation is enforced.Such policies cause a sort of magnification of the present in the minds of most people. Suppose you ask someone who has been living in the same house for 30 years what he or she paid for it. The purchase price will probably look ridiculously small. If one is not careful to remember the effects of inflation on all prices, it might seem that we are living in a magnificently successful new era. With silent inflation, it can be easy to forget that the truth is much less dramatic.At the same time, in an age of internet rumours and fake news, the world today can look a little unmoored from history. That might create a sense of real risk.Inflation targeting has other effects, too, which seem to be more on the minds of central bankers.The news media’s tendency to fixate on new records serves their short-term interest in creating the impression that something really important has happened that justifies readers’ or viewers’ attention. But sometimes there is a bit of fakery in the record, especially when the record is described in nominal terms and we have steady inflation. As a result, the emphasis on records can encourage a disrespect for history and nurture a sort of disoriented feeling that we live in exceptionally uncertain times.The money illusion even bleeds into impressions of the “strength” of the economy, as if a high level of GDP growth or a bull market are indicators of the health of something called the economy. GDP growth numbers are conventionally reported in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, and unemployment numbers are unit-free. But reporting of just about every other major economic indicator is generally not corrected for inflation.An inflation target of a few percentage points may seem to promote stability, and perhaps it really does. But we need to consider the possibility that it may lead to subtle misperceptions that have the opposite effect on the stability of our judgments.• Robert Shiller is a 2013 Nobel laureate in economics, professor of economics at Yale University and the co-creator of the Case-Shiller Index of US house prices.

It has teamed up with hundreds of charity partners across the UK which will distribute the essential foodstuffs to local communities in time for Christmas.As part of the same initiative involving Sainsbury’s sister company and retailer Argos, shoppers will also be able to donate new toys in store until 16 December.The Help Brighten a Million Christmases campaign is being launched during the festive season when it aims to attract at least 1m donations of foods and toys. But as demand for donated or surplus food in the UK continues to soar against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness, the permanent scheme will be the largest of its kind in the country.The eye-catching labels were the brainchild of a group of teenagers working on a summer social project in Exeter who noticed that customers only spotted food bank donation baskets after finishing their shop.As part of a National Citizen Service (NCS) initiative, which aims to encourage community and social cohesion, the teenagers created the shelf-edge label to remind customers during their shop and signpost appropriate items. After successfully pitching the idea to the manager of Sainsbury’s Exeter branch, the labels were implemented in store and donations tripled as a result.“We’re excited to be working together to expand Sainsbury’s food donation programme and to launch Argos’s toy donation programme” said Claudine Blamey, Sainsbury’s head of corporate responsibility and sustainability.“It’s been brilliant to work with NCS graduates to permanently roll out their label initiative to all our stores and help reach our target of 1m donations.”Mark Richardson, the manager of Exeter food bank, added: “The result of this initiative just goes to show that sometimes you just need a new mind on an old problem. Sometimes the most simple ideas have the greatest impact. This campaign has already had fantastic results locally, and I’m excited to see how it can benefit food banks and their clients across the UK.”Among the hundreds of Sainsbury’s charity partners are the UK’s biggest food bank network the Trussell Trust – which operates 428 food banks – the Salvation Army, the Felix Project and City Harvest.Supermarkets have faced criticism for not doing more to redistribute edible food from their own supply chains to the needy – although Sainsbury’s co-founded the food redistribution charity FareShare in 1994 with the homelessness charity Crisis and supported its launch as an independent charity in 2004.Food banks in some of the poorest areas, meanwhile, are preparing for a big rise in demand when universal credit is rolled out by calling for more donations and volunteers, and stockpiling essential supplies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/653c17472147c26d6d5155c90cb4afb77c3cc0a5/540_361_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad516246682174a84419ae2f3bbff56a","title":"cyber monday live best uk deals christmas","story":"Didn’t get everything you needed for Christmas on Black Friday? Never fear - here is our guide to what is on offer in the UK on Cyber MondayAmidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there’s been a move in the US to try and get “Museum Sunday” to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn’t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look.A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there’s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions.If there’s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there’s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today.

We are largely unaware, for example, of the 250 miles of railway track running underground and the hundreds of other lives being lived in the buildings that surround our own. Despite having lived on the same road in Kentish Town for 20 years, I have never seen the inside of a neighbour’s house.I am continually reminded of those things I can’t see: a plaque round the corner tells me that the River Fleet flows beneath me, and there are always photographs tied to lamp posts telling me to look out for pets who have disappeared, as my cat did, into the maelstrom of back yards. People also disappear in London, which is one reason why they come here. I’m only aware of how much I want to vanish into the sea of faces when I leave the city and find myself uncomfortably visible again.But the most strikingly invisible part of London is the air we breathe. Since the Clean Air Act 1956 we no longer have the peasoupers like the one described by Charles Dickens in Bleak House where there is fog everywhere, “making a soft black drizzle with flakes of soot as big as full-grown snowflakes”. But just because the air is now clear doesn’t mean it is clean.TB is invisible in two senses. First, its victims tend to be socially invisible: the bacterium ravages the lungs of the poor, the homeless, the malnourished those whose immune systems have been weakened by overcrowding, exhaustion, drug use. It flourishes among migrant communities living in poverty, in prisons, and in hostels and halfway houses. Second, many of the destitute people we see every day have TB without knowing it: the symptoms of TB – cough, fever, night sweats and weight loss – hide behind the other effects of deprivation or addiction. So TB in London is like the titular object in Edgar Allan Poe’s The Purloined Letter, which avoided detection by hiding in plain sight.As a writer I tend to see London as collection of stories, and TB has always been for me an evolving story that wasn’t always about invisibility. Two hundred years ago, TB was a tale of sensibility. Because I grew up inside books, I assumed that consumption, as it was once called, afflicted only those who lived more intensely than the rest of us: creative people who expired from the sheer nobility of being.Marguerite Gautier, the consumptive courtesan in La Dame aux Camélias by Alexandre Dumas (fils), was the prototype: clutching her blood-spotted handkerchief, she burned beneath translucent skin. All my favourite writers, virtually without exception, died or were rumoured to have died from consumption: Keats, Kafka, Chekhov, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Poe, and all three Bronte sisters, plus their brother, Branwell DH Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Walter Scott, Dostoyevsky, Robert Louis Stevenson, George Orwell.TB was the illness of storytellers, and so it was appropriate that, in order to learn the stories of TB on the streets of London, I was guided by a specialist at University College hospital called Al Story. It was also appropriate that Story took me first to Keats House in Hampstead, the pastoral spot where, in 1818, the 23-year-old poet first coughed up blood and proclaimed it his “death-warrant”. A Mediterranean-style villa in the rolling hills of Hampstead Heath seems an unlikely place to contract pulmonary TB: disease rates were then three times higher in the overcrowded parishes of Whitechapel and St Giles Cripplegate. But Keats House is, in many ways, where the story of consumption was born.It was not where the disease itself was born of course – the bacterium is at least 17,000 years old – but where the romance began, because the myth of consumption as a flame that consumed the body from the inside was largely a product of Romanticism. It was John Keats, in Ode to a Nightingale – supposedly written in the house’s garden – who described the effects of consumption with the words “youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies” then consolidated the idea of the consumptive as being “half in love with easeful Death”. The image was later fixed by Joseph Severn’s portrait of him on his deathbed in Rome, where he had gone for a change of air, preparing to “fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget”.The romantic version of consumption itself expired when Robert Koch announced in March 1882 that he had discovered its cause, the tubercle bacillus. It was now proved to be an airborne infection rather than an inborn disposition, so a new TB story emerged in the 20th century: a tale of anger.Around 100 years after Keats left Hampstead for Rome, Katherine Mansfield and DH Lawrence both moved to the heath. Both authors had TB, with Lawrence having possibly infected Mansfield, and both described themselves not as inwardly burning but as outwardly blazing: they raged against the dying of the light. “You revolt me stewing in your consumption,” Lawrence wrote once to Mansfield. It was an appalling thing to say, but the illness appalled people, especially those, like Lawrence, who spent their lives denying that they had it.Lawrence, who probably contracted TB as a child in his Nottingham mining community, couldn’t enter a room without flinging open the window, regardless of the weather, and his wanderings through Italy and New Mexico took him to higher and higher spots. Even in Hampstead he lived at the top of the heath, in the aptly named Vale of Health: a sort of city sanatorium. Right until the end, when his lungs were shrivelled and he weighed seven stone, he described his condition as “bronchial”.This is where the complexity of the TB story sets in: the glamour disguised a terrible shame, so much so that the illness couldn’t be named, even by doctors. As Kafka wrote to a friend from a sanatorium two months before his death: “Verbally I don’t learn anything definite, since in discussing tuberculosis ... everybody drops into a shy, evasive, glassy-eyed manner of speech.”It is no longer possible to disguise TB behind a mask of sensibility, but the disease is still hiding in plain sight. Today in London, there is still so much shame about TB, Story told me, that he has known patients who would rather be diagnosed with Aids. To illustrate his point he took me to a location that, to protect the identity of the people we met there, will remain undisclosed. There stood a large white van emblazoned with the NHS logo: the pan-London Find \u0026amp Treat mobile service, an x-ray unit that cruises the streets targeting those at risk of contracting the bacterium. Story is the founder of the mission.I realised I must have passed the Find \u0026amp Treat van on a dozen occasions over the years without having the faintest idea that it was a TB eradication machine. Stepping inside I found a small world of nurses, social workers, former TB sufferers, and people having their lungs screened by a radiologist called Jane Knight. Showing me a pair of lungs on the screen, she described what she was looking for. As it happened, I had been thinking a good deal about lungs that week, not only in preparation for my exploration of TB in London with Story but because I had the day before, had my lungs x-rayed as part of a general health check attached to rheumatoid arthritis. And while I was in the Find \u0026amp Treat van my consultant at University College hospital actually left a message on my mobile phone asking me to call her.I didn’t get the message, and instead followed Story west to a narrow Georgian road in Fitzrovia that was once the site of the Cleveland Street workhouse. It is a place of multiple stories. Dickens lived nine doors down from it as a child, and the workhouse is believed to have been the inspiration for the one where the nine-year-old Oliver Twist, slowly starving, asks for a second bowl of gruel. I had expected a red-brick fortress behind high walls, but it was nothing of the sort. The former workhouse was hidden behind giant advertising hoardings informing us that it was being transformed into 52 luxury apartments selling for £2m each.In the mid-19th century, the medical officer for the Cleveland Street workhouse was Joseph Rogers, one of the many invisible Londoners in the TB story. He was a tireless public health campaigner, one of whose achievements was the elimination, in 1851, of window tax. This was, notoriously, a tax on sunlight, fresh air and good health: bricking in windows prevented ventilation and spread disease. Every 18th- or early 19th-century street has at least one blocked-out window, and for every blocked-out window there was a greater risk of contagion, and death. Rogers, who also helped to found the Association for the Improvement of Workhouse Infirmaries, belongs in a line of great London reformers, men like Henry Mayhew, author of London Labour and the London Poor, who interviewed market traders, prostitutes, sweatshop workers, and even the “mudlarks” who searched the banks of the Thames for wood, metal, rope and coal from passing ships. Al Story similarly seems to know everyone. His city runs parallel to mine: I see health, he sees sickness I see wealth, he sees poverty. He pointed out to me those people on the streets whose lungs are possibly infected by the tubercle bacillus. He surveys London with a new set of eyes: a blend of periscope and x-ray specs, rooting out the marginalised and dispossessed and putting them back on the radar, rather like George Orwell, who died of TB in 1950 at University College hospital on Gower Street, where Story stood and indicated the room to me. Where did Orwell contract the disease, I wonder: when he was down and out in Paris, or London?When I came home that afternoon to think about how TB became the untold story of the city, something extraordinary happened, the coincidence of which I still haven’t quite absorbed. My consultant rang again and told me that, having looked at the x-rays of my lungs, it appeared I had two tumours. They might be malignant, they might be benign. I returned the next day to University College hospital for a CT scan of my chest, and thought, as I lay there, of the many thousands of lungs that Jane Knight and Al Story had examined over the years in their x-ray van.When the results of my scan came back it transpired that the tumours were not cancerous, but the remnants of undiagnosed childhood TB. I had lived with tuberculosis for 40 years, as unaware of the infection as I was of the River Fleet flowing beneath my house. TB was my story too.Contagious Cities is part of an international cultural project, developed by Wellcome.

Lee has become a fast hero of mine, although I only learned about her recently through Cathy Newman’s brilliant book, Bloody Brilliant Women: the Pioneers, Revolutionaries and Geniuses Your History Teacher Forgot to Mention.Lee, who was born in Scotland, was a Labour MP. She was the first minister for the arts, and is still the only person to table a white paper on the arts (A Policy for the Arts, 1965). She was instrumental in widening the remit of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1967, particularly into the regions. Lee was so popular with theatregoers that she would be applauded by audiences whenever she went to see a show, which was often. (She was also involved in establishing The Open University and, a side note, was Nye Bevan’s wife: an absolute Labour power couple.)How we need a Jennie Lee for these philistine times. This month, Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and port (DCMS), gave us a surprising insight into his reading habits. He was unable to name a single female newspaper columnist when pressed five times (he eventually alighted on the Daily ’s Allison Pearson). He also said he does not subscribe to a single newspaper, but relies on aides to summarise their content for him. Of course, Wright is a busy man and pressed for time, but given that he is also responsible for “media ownership and mergers” and is also to lead a review into the future of journalism, it was an extraordinary admission. Wright also revealed his fondness for Lego. This was widely mocked, which was rather unfair. Because – and here’s the thing – at least it spoke of an actual interest. A real hobby outside of heckling on the green benches. Whether Lego falls under the category of culture is a different matter.Wright is just the latest in a long line of culture secretaries who appear to have no firm interest in any aspect of the brief. To be fair to the former incumbent, Jeremy Hunt, at least he is well known as a passionate lambada dancer, though he let himself down with his flakiness on BSkyB. We have now had three culture secretaries in just two years, such is the disregard for the office. Matt Hancock said he liked Ed Sheeran, and Karen Bradley apparently listened to Adele (the most mainstream, safest artists to pick, which smacks of focus groups). All several cultural isions below Jennie.Politicians are often seen as iniduals who go straight from university into the political arena, (sometimes via a brief stint in PR), and seem to have few other interests. They appear to read Hansard and little else. Jeremy Corbyn was slated for stating that Ulysses is his favourite book (people thought it pretentious), but at least it was evidence he reads for pleasure. Though he probably just read half of it, like the rest of us. One of the most excruciating mid-speech moments by David Cameron, was when he – an oft-professed fan of Aston Villa – forgot which club he ostensibly supported, and praised West Ham (who have similar club colours). Remember Gordon Brown saying his favourite band were Arctic Monkeys, who “really wake you up in the morning”, and then he couldn’t name a single one of their songs?The cultural deficit at the DCMS matters. The state of the arts in Britain does not make for good reading. The Arts Council England (ACE) budget for 2018 to 2022 has been cut by £156m. There seems to be no recognition of how powerful the arts can be in educating audiences, reflecting current events, exploring different views and opening up dialogue.In the past year alone, I have enjoyed Nicholas Hytner’s version of Julius Caesar at The Bridge, influenced by Trump’s America The Jungle’s tale of life in the Calais refugee camp Alan Bennett’s Allelujah!, a celebration of the NHS. In good news, the regions have gained support, but access is still often limited to a certain demographic: older, middle-class, affluent and white. As for sport, the 2012 Olympics were, agreed by almost everyone, a national success, but in London, grassroots sport has been cut by an average of £400,000 per borough, while youth crime increases.Lee argued that the arts should be accessible to every adult and child, ingrained in everyday life the education system local communities, almost as an extension of public health. The UK has much to be proud of in the arts – we are among the world leaders – but Lee’s vision has not come to pass, and if anything we are going backwards. Culture desperately needs a Lee, not a seemingly indifferent minister who, if recent history repeats itself, will be replaced in about a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498637530ad5cc8a189ea05a037e56fcb95382da/0_0_4500_2698/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49aed94e39674a9f9024b443f00d926","title":"theresa may brexit deal meltdown","story":"Dark arts will be used to win support for the prime minister’s plan. But the key question is what happens when MPs reject itIt was a funeral masquerading as a baptism. In Brussels, Theresa May’s Brexit deal was welcomed into the world by the UK’s 27 soon-to-be-ex-partners and the priesthood of the European commission.Yet she should have been wearing black and a mantilla. The deal is, as Tony Blair told the BBC’s Andrew Marr, a “dodo”. In her open letter to the nation, the prime minister declared that the agreement “is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people … a deal for a brighter future”.But this is an ex-deal. The only reason it is sitting on its perch is because it has been nailed there.It is dead because – barring a truly dramatic realignment of parliamentary opinion – it simply cannot survive the “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons expected on 10 December.Julian Smith, the government chief whip – who looks like a dentist who positively enjoys giving his patients insufficient Novocaine – is now May’s most important cabinet colleague by far. In the next fortnight he and his team must use every conceivable inducement and threat to reach the magic total of 320 votes: knighthoods, peerages, gongs and legislative time will be offered to waverers. Those MPs who oppose the deal will be asked whether their families would really enjoy reading about their sexual indiscretions in the newspapers. Most of this nasty work will be carried out by intermediaries (even whips need plausible deniability). But any and every tactic available to the government will be used this is life and death, and no time for political squeamishness.But I still don’t see how Smith does it. Some MPs, strapped to the dentist’s chair, will indeed give in when he holds the drill in front of their eyes and asks: “Is your vote safe?” But I have yet to be convinced that he can get from around 260 (if you assume, generously, the support for the deal of 15 Labour rebels) to 320.What really matters, then, is not the first Commons vote, but the second. Let us assume that the PM is defeated next month: the political world is then plunged into an extraordinary Christmas crisis. May could, of course, force the issue with a confidence motion – or simply resign on the spot (unlikely, given her recent pattern of behaviour). Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, conceded to Marr that it was “not possible to rule out” the wholesale collapse of the government.The PM might yet, in any case, face the more parochial challenge of a Conservative vote of confidence, threatening her position as party leader: Jacob Rees-Mogg only has the names of 26 Tory MPs in his elegantly tailored pocket, but that could easily increase to the necessary 48 if May’s deal was rejected by the Commons.The EU would also have to consider its response. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, declared that “this is the best deal possible. This is the only deal possible.” The history of diplomacy suggests that most such statements contain a footnote written in invisible ink: “Unless we have to amend it a bit.” One can still imagine a few scraps being thrown May’s way to show good faith.But the fundamental controversies etched into the deal – the Irish border “backstop”, the continued role of the European court of justice, the prospect of the UK remaining indefinitely in the customs union – are not going to be removed by Brussels in a moment of shocked epiphany. Tweaks, maybe core alterations, absolutely not.Deplorably, senior government figures are actively hoping that the markets will respond with panic to the parliamentary failure of the deal, and, to adapt Dr Johnson, focus the minds of MPs sufficiently to deliver a majority second time round. The precedent cited in this context is the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) devised by George W Bush’s administration in 2008 to prop up the financial system after the crash. After its initial rejection by Congress, the US stock market fell by seven percentage points. Congress promptly endorsed the plan.But this is a ridiculous parallel to draw. The crash was a clear and present danger. The Brexit deal is simply a damn-fool plan drawn up in response to the result of a referendum involving lies, illegality and foreign interference. The crash could not be halted by popular will: fortunately, with Brexit there is precisely that option, in the form of a people’s vote.Expect the campaign for a fresh referendum to gather in strength after the parliamentary vote. Those who have always felt that a no-deal Brexit was the cleanest and most honest option – the oxymoronic “managed” no-deal of Dominic Raab’s fantasies – will shift up a gear. Within the cabinet, a new “gang of five” (Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Lidington) are reported by the Mail on Sunday to be ready to quit if a no-deal exit becomes a serious prospect.Even as May shook hands with Jean-Claude Juncker, the political village was transforming itself into a noisy constitutional souk. At every stall, the traders offer alternative models: “Norway for now!” “Canada ++!” “Switzerland!” “Get yer article 50 extension here!” None of these alternatives, it should be emphasised, has been seriously countenanced by the EU. But they are already being offered to curious MPs at early-bird prices.What unites this cacophonous marketplace is the absolute assumption that the deal will fail in December. The 585-page agreement and its 26-page political annex are already regarded as redundant. The variables are dizzying, the stakes vertiginous. The worst news that May has ever had to confront is that the past two-and-a-half years were the easy bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49dd6fa233e13db5ea82ff9d8c3c39a937afb6c1/0_12_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6671ca813ed9d6a495fbfe3fa71542e8","title":"liberals politics emotion right wing populists","story":"Attachment to place and identity can be part of a radical democratic project that speaks to people’s heartsIn Europe, the United States and Brazil, authoritarian nationalism is sweeping to power through a mixture of negative emotion and elite connivance. But this is no mere re-run of the 1930s. In the first place, unlike in Germany, Italy and Spain at the incipient moments of their dictatorships, the existing elites neither want nor need fascism. Their problem is that they don’t know how to fight it.Over the past 15 years political science has engaged a well-evidenced but unfruitful debate over what caused the rise of parties such as Ukip, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, or France’s Front National. In general, I think it is proven that cultural rather than economic insecurities are what’s driving politics to the right. But it does not follow from this that action at the economic level can’t stem the tide of plebeian racism. In order to get the actions right, though, we have to understand that the political narratives of the centre are failing due to the way the free-market economy was designed.Probably the best short definition of neoliberalism as a system rather than an ideology comes from the Goldsmiths University academic Will Davies, who calls it “the disenchantment of politics by economics”. By this, he means the introduction of market logic into all forms of social life by force, which has severely limited the scope for political choice.If I want to save Port Talbot steelworks, for instance, I cannot legally do so on grounds of national security, or preference for British goods, or sentiment, or because the town will die without the blast furnaces. I can only do so if I present a chop-logic argument that meets various national, European and global rules on trade and investment. If I just want to save it because I feel good driving past a giant piece of human ingenuity on the way to the surfing beach, the emotion is effectively blocked by the rules-based coercion states have signed up to.Another way of phrasing Davies’s definition, then, could be the evisceration of politics by economics, or more simply the surgical removal of emotional reasoning from political decision-making.At the most basic level – and this explains the rise of both the left and right opponents of neoliberalism – people understood that emotion, and with it feelings of identity, place, nation and class, could only reinsert itself into decision-making if the system were disrupted.A second driver of this emotion-driven revolt is what’s happened in the workplace. Neither political science nor economics has been very interested in the workplace as a political arena. Forty years ago, in my first factory job, I found myself in a permanent and highly educated political meeting it lasted from the morning tea break to the end of overtime. Comparing that time with this, two changes stand out.First, modern managements demand a high level of performativity, especially from the least powerful: employees are required to wish us a safe journey, or a nice day, or to upsell us Toblerones at the till. Second, work is far more explicitly coercive for those with low skills and low incomes than it was before the neoliberal era. The threat of the sack is not implicit it is in your face, daily. With it come the bullying, favouritism and sexual harassment cases that are the bread and butter of trade union activists. At the sharp end, in professions like taxi driving, truck driving, security and cleaning work, the threat of actual violence is often close. And in daily life, at the bottom end of the income scale, everybody knows someone involved in low-level organised crime.This has to be contributing to the strong but unacknowledged feelings of insecurity and frustration that pour out on the doorstep, once people have got over listing all the races and religions they would like to eradicate.The first lesson from this for liberal centrism, if it wishes to survive, is that it needs an emotional narrative with an inspirational core offer. And that core offer has to be economic hope: there is nothing that says the far left has to own policies of fiscal expansion, redistribution, state aid and high wages. It’s just that the neoliberal economic textbook says they can’t be done. The “fear of the future” reported in much qualitative research on supporters of the nationalist right is, for many of them, rational. People are reacting as if scared, depressed and angry because the world created by precarious employment, poor housing and rising inequality is scary, depressing and annoying.If you can’t answer the question: “How does life get rapidly better for me and my family?”, no amount of communicative power will help. Secondly, the centre has to make a strategic choice: to side with the left against the right. All discussions of populism that avoid that conclusion are worthless.If you Google the words Sajid Javid and fascism, you will see he has called Momentum, which I am a member of, a “neo-fascist group”. I can find no comment by Javid about the Whitehall rampage by up to 10,000 supporters of Tommy Robinson, among them actual sieg-heiling Nazis, in which they bricked and bottled the politan police. The duplicity and denial phase among centrists has to stop.Because I don’t think the crisis of democratic consent in the west will abate rather it will peak like a wave, and break in a series of national crises whose choreography is already predictable: a swing to the right by the CDU post-Merkel a run-off between Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Marine Le Pen in the next French presidential election a full-blown Matteo Salvini government in Italy a showdown between the Falange nostalgics in the Spanish elite and Catalan separatism Hungary and Poland sliding deeper into the grip of demagogues.In the face of that, the parties labelled “left populist” in the ’s “new populism” series are destined to play a decisive part in the resistance. They need to learn to fight intelligently, not run, as Alexis Tsipras did in Greece, headlong into the lights of the oncoming train. They need above all to learn to construct alliances – as Podemos and Barcelona en Comú are doing in Spain.If things get worse, we will all be grateful that the radical left has crafted a narrative of hope. At the battle of Jarama in 1937 at Suicide Hill, the men who marched into a hail of bullets to stop Franco taking Madrid were a mixture of British socialists, communists and former IRA men. If you read the memoirs of survivors, the common currency is hope for the future, pride in the act of resistance, and a belief in agency. Actively promoting such a conviction is one of the strongest weapons we possess against the soul-draining negativity of the authoritarian right.• Paul Mason is a writer and broadcaster on economics and social justice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/826c9ec8cb4ec2f1bd414ea758ebb0e1802841d9/157_48_2850_1710/master/2850.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=03052daf610b43bf38d087a2bb20f7c4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sharp","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sharp’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sharp’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what sharp means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 28 November at 10am.

He became friends with Zeldin after luring him to Chicago to adapt his play Beyond Caring, an exploration of zero-hours working. Schwimmer’s mother-in-law had seen it at The Yard in Hackney and been impressed.“Alex and I are very like-minded. We are both passionately committed to a kind of storytelling and making those who are marginalised in society and those who are invisible … making them more visible.”Schwimmer offered to always be there for Zeldin’s work and the feeling is mutual. “When the opportunity to film Love came along I was clear that I wanted David involved.”Zeldin is artist-in-residence at the National Theatre and committed to shaking things up. “Theatre as an art form does sometimes need a bit of a kick because it can become quite staid,” he said. “It can become quite bourgeois and boring. A lot of the time it is boring.”The one-hour film is social realism in the vein of Ken Loach and is profoundly moving as well as, at times, difficult to watch. It tells the story of homeless families sharing temporary accommodation in the run-up to Christmas.The play has been compared to Loach’s film I Daniel Blake. “Loach has been a huge inspiration to me and I’d be honoured if he saw this film,” said Zeldin. “When Loach talks about the conscious cruelty of the system, that’s something I’ve spent several years investigating and it knows no bounds.”He spent two years working with Shelter, talking to 20 different families and visiting as many B\u0026ampBs. The result was a play which the ’s Michael Billington praised as creating “engrossing drama out of the daily rituals of survival.”The film will move people, make them angry but it is up to audiences how they react, said Zeldin. “You make work and you get asked what do you want people to do? I don’t know that that’s my job to answer that question. I seek to touch people, to disturb, I’m not interested in being polite, I’m not interested in lying, I’m not interested in making political agitprop. I’m interested in making artistic work.”Schwimmer hopes that at the least people might check themselves when they pass a homeless person, and think about how they respond.The actor is best known for his television work and more recently, his use of social media, but theatre is his passion and increasingly needed, he said.“We are so used to our screens and living in isolation and there are very few moments in which we can come together as a community.“Theatre can illuminate certain social problems and illnesses in society and allow people to think about them and be moved by them… to feel the experience of what it is like.”A project in which Schwimmer would act at the National in a play written and directed by Zeldin is very much on the cards, the pair said.The film is the latest in the BBC Arts Performance Live strand, which has also seen a film of Hofesh Shechter’s Clowns and Akala performing his poem The Ruins of Empires. Also part of the collaboration are BBC Films and Arts Council England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ffea92548fd75cd7cc8b8259ac506c225101f96/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74e821a102ee7d29b001877562a907d3","title":"scientists prepare for the most detailed whale poo expedition ever","story":"Team will collect samples in the Antarctic to prove role of mammal in function of the oceans Most people go out of their way to avoid even the faintest whiff of excrement, but a team of scientists is now preparing to voyage for seven weeks to the Antarctic so they can collect blue whale faeces and examine its impact on bioersity and climate change.“The most detailed whale poo expedition ever,” as the participants have dubbed it, aims to test a theory that waste from the world’s biggest mammal plays a far more crucial role in maintaining the productivity of southern oceans than previously believed.“I want to show that whales are ecosystem engineers,” said Lavenia Ratnarajah, a marine biogeochemist at the University of Liverpool. “Conservation campaigns are usually focussed on their beauty, but that doesn’t convince everyone. If we can show how much these animals contribute to the functions of the ocean, then it will be easier to save them.Until now, most research has focused on the breeding and migratory habits of these giant creatures, which can grow to more than 30 metres in length and weigh 200 tonnes – more than even the largest dinosaurs. But the new research will consider how they contribute to nutrition levels in Antarctic waters.Whale excrement acts as an iron-rich ocean fertiliser that stimulates the growth of marine bacteria and phytoplankton – tiny plants that form the base of the Antarctic food chain and act as the greatest biological source of carbon sequestration. Without the biological recycling of iron, the relatively anaemic Southern Ocean would not be able to sustain as much phytoplankton, which is the main food for krill.The new study will try to quantify that fertilising impact and test theories that the whale is irreplaceable in the polar ecosystem because the other major predators – penguins and seals – tend to defecate on the ice rather than in the water so they cannot provide the same nutritional benefits.The team – along with dozens of other scientists – on 19 January from Hobart, Tasmania on the Research Vessel Investigator, which is is funded by the the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Australian Antarctic Division. They will first deploy sonar buoys to identify the location of the whales and then, when close, use drones to fly above them and wait for telltale orange plumes. It can take days.The faeces, which is mainly composed of digested krill, initially floats on the surface before dissipating and then sinking to the floor of the ocean. On previous missions, researchers have had to collect samples by hand, but this time they are relieved that they can get drones to do the dirty work.“You don’t want to fall into it. It’s liquid and smells awful,” said Ratnarajah, who plans to tweet about the voyage.“Sometimes I think I have the worst job in the world and sometimes I think I have the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159065752173434675f1ab79fc2d1f11fbc9419f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b8200a8c3869d6897bf731f8158493","title":"boys on film what we can learn about masculinity from hollywood","story":"In a range of new films from First Man to Beautiful Boy, male characters are representing two different types of masculinity: unblemished and toxicBetween First Man, Beautiful Boy, Boy Erased and The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun, Oscar-bait films with singular, male-referencing nouns in their titles are in season. Is it mere happenstance, a case of nominal fortuity, or does it suggest a more sweeping reappraisal of masculinity and boyhood in this year’s films? Well, a little bit of both.To say Hollywood hasn’t always been interested in the particularities of men and their inner lives would be untrue. Were that so there might be a Netflix category for Films Starring Emotionally Constipated Men the way there’s one for Strong Female Leads. Alas, the former is something of a cinematic convention, the latter, unfortunately, still a subcategory deserving of special designation.Many film-makers – Sam Peckinpah, for instance – have made the study of the violent male id their cause célèbre. And from John Wayne to Humphrey Bogart to James Bond, movies have historically provided a blueprint (albeit, a single-minded one) for the performance of masculinity, so much so that Woody Allen’s character in Play it Again, Sam literally conjures Bogart’s ghost to seek his counsel on courting women. “I never met one who didn’t understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a .45,” says a spectral Bogart.Suffice it to say that on-screen examinations of men and masculinity have tended toward hagiography, subtly and not-so-subtly reinforcing patriarchal notions about how to be a man. But as Hollywood itself belatedly reckons with toxic masculinity and the harmful, abusive ways it’s reared its head, more complicated portraits of men are upon us. There was last year’s Phantom Thread, nothing if not a critical study of corrosive male ego, and a succession of awards season juggernauts – Birdman, Boyhood, Moonlight – that could each be considered male coming-of-age stories, even as the age in question varies dramatically.Watching this year’s spate of movies, however, I couldn’t help but notice the ways they attempted, to varying degrees of success, to explore two particular kinds of topical masculinity that haven’t always been on screen: a youthful, unblemished one, in which adversity is sentimentalized, and a toxic one, in which pain works as a plot-stimulant, giving cause to our male protagonist’s destructive or selfish or emotionally repressed behavior.Take, for instance, First Man, which doesn’t lionize Neil Armstrong’s dogged race to the moon so much as it suggests the quest itself is a distraction from the death of his two-year old daughter and the monotony of suburban American life. Director Damien Chazelle has tended to venerate the monumental achievements of certain Great White Men, but it was something of a relief to see Armstrong’s daring and determination complicated, depicted for what it was: a hero’s journey, sure, but one motivated in large part by a culture that once forbade masculine displays of emotion, fragility and bereavement. First Man has been written off as nostalgic for that era, but it ought to be seen as more of an interrogation than an endorsement of it.Paul Dano’s superb Wildlife, too, examines the ways mid-century men dealt with wounded egos: Jake Gyllenhaal’s Jerry is so miffed after being fired from his job as a golf pro that he abandons his family to fight faraway wildfires. A past version of that same film might have considered that decision properly righteous, but here it’s seen as cowardly, a balm for the character’s pride. Make no mistake – First Man and Wildlife could hardly be more different. But in both films we find ourselves identifying with Neil and Jerry’s wives, played by Claire Foy and Carey Mulligan with the bewilderment of strong women who’ve wound up with men so spiritually and emotionally aloof. In both Gosling and Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, there’s a quiet, sad-eyed diffidence that gestures toward a new kind of leading man, or at least a new perspective on the ones of yesteryear.New kinds of leading men can be seen in two other films this year: Beautiful Boy, in which a father and son wrestle with the latter’s drug addiction, and Boy Erased, in which fundamentalist Christian parents send their teenage son Jared off to conversion therapy camp, later learning the cruel ignorance of their ways.Both films feature stellar performances from Timothée Chalamet and Lucas Hedges, respectively, but they render the pain of addiction and institutionalized bigotry in superficial ways, mostly as engines for parental enlightenment and filial devotion. David, father to Nick, struggling with an addiction to meth, can’t seem to wrap his head around the disease, not least because it doesn’t square with his notion of the kind of young man his son is: budding, beaming, beautiful. The film, though, is similarly incredulous, tethered to those same idealistic ideas of the handsome, white, and morally pure suburban son, replete with potential and unjustly afflicted with disease. Chalamet plays the part formidably, but the film suffers where it prescribes to the dogma instead of interrogating it, as if to ask how on earth this could happen instead of why.Jared’s pain in Boy Erased is of an entirely different sort, but it, too, is a film about the weight of society’s expectations of young men. Like Beautiful Boy, though, it doesn’t seem genuinely curious about those expectations beyond a simple straight-gay continuum. Mostly, it turns pain into polemic. But at its best moments – like one scene where Joel Edgerton’s conversion therapy drill sergeant has the boys lined up on a scale of least-to-most manly – the film asks tough questions about the cultural gradients of masculinity, the shades of which are often simplified on-screen.Seeing as “toxic” is Oxford Dictionary’s 2018 word of the year – its second most-frequent collocation is, of course, “toxic masculinity” – it makes sense that the year’s most thoughtful consideration of the subject can be found in Burning, the South Korean director Lee Chang-Dong’s psychological thriller that turns the love triangle of Jules and Jim on its head. It’s a film that’s honest, and strikingly literal, about the way men react to threats to their masculinity – with seething resentment, unspoken desire, and violence against women and each other. Like the hearings about Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged abuse did, it captures the harm and erasure enacted upon women caught in the throes of masculine one upmanship.It makes strange sense, then, that Robert Redford’s delectable turn in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun is supposedly his final role. David Lowery’s film, in its relish for Redford’s waspish looks and smooth, movie-star charm, is itself a kind of swan song for a bygone version of the American man, solitary, sandy-blond and square-jawed.

The decision is also somewhat damning of Özil given Bournemouth are hardly the most rugged of opposition and will only reopen the debate about the playmaker’s long-term future under Arsène Wenger’s successor.Rumours of a rift between the pair first developed after Özil missed Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over West Ham in August. Emery claimed the player was ill but it was reported that his absence was down to a training ground row with the Spaniard.It will be intriguing to see if Özil is restored to Emery’s starting line-up for Sunday’s visit of Tottenham. Arsenal will go into that game buoyed by this win, one that extends their unbeaten run to 17 games and puts them just one point behind fourth-placed Chelsea.The visitors took the lead through Jefferson Lerma’s astonishing own goal on 30 minutes before being pegged back by Joshua King’s strike in first-half stoppage time. Aubameyang eventually got a winner for Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e56fcac50d063f42502cfbf2c5b82e220d3c3257/34_41_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=714d911567ea0587add0f5365ce71cf4","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend action","story":"Mesut Özil is in limbo again, Neil Warnock will spend in January and Leicester’s James Maddison makes up for his eMesut Özil cannot quite get rid of the question marks. He was left on the bench throughout Arsenal’s win at Bournemouth, not even emerging to warm up during the second half as Unai Emery – in his own words – “decided for other options” and while he will at least be fresh for the almost-dead Europa League rubber against Vorskla Poltava he would presumably have had other things in mind when signing his new contract in February. Özil’s best work this season has come when fielded atNo 10, a role that was unavailable in the 3-4-3 Emery deployed on Sunday, and the head coach may have seen enough to extend the experiment. “We are finding our best performance with the system, with the players and with the combination,” Emery said, in a clear acknowledgingment that Arsenal are still looking for a balance that satisfies him despite their unbeaten run stretching to 17 games. Nobody would doubt Özil’s ability to unlock a defence but Emery’s demand for a better blend between attack and defence may leave his prospects uncertain. Nick Ames• Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal• Bournemouth too ‘demanding’ for dropped Özil, says Emery• Nick Ames: Emery’s tough tactics bear fruitMaurizio Sarri had been warning for weeks that it would come to this if lessons were not learned. That those slow starts would eventually punish Chelsea. “Now the problem is evident and I hope, first of all, to the players,” he grumbled, pointing to slackness in possession, a lack of urgency throughout the lineup, and an inability “to stay compact”. The players, of whom five fronted up to the media post-match and admitted standards had slipped, understandably called for a little perspective given this was a first defeat in 19 competitive matches under Sarri, and even suggested the loss was timely, but could offer no real explanation to the plodding openings. “It’s good for us to understand, to remind us that the Premier League is never easy,” said David Luiz. “Nobody is happy. But the coach has been many times angrier when we’ve won. It’s true.” Sarri has been demanding improvement since day one, and defeat will have stung. The squad may see a different side to the Italian at Cobham on Monday. Dominic Fifield• Match report: Tottenham 3-1 Chelsea• Dominic Fifield: Alli stifles Jorginho to put Chelsea’s title hopes on hold• Hazard again suggests he may leave Chelsea in the summerAs he headed for the tunnel after 28 minutes, sent off after two moments of madness, James Maddison bowed his head in shame. He knew he had made a mistake, committed one of the most inexcusable crimes on a football pitch: ing. But, an ounce of credit to the Leicester midfielder for not going into hiding. Long before his embarrassing fall in the box was magnified on Match of the Day, the 22-year-old came out to confront the deserved criticism. “Nobody wants to see ing in our beautiful game,” he posted on Instagram. “I was anticipating contact that never came, but that’s no excuse. I will learn from it.” Maddison’s naivety took Leicester’s red-card tally to four this season, twice as many as any other side. Under Claude Puel, nine players have been sent off in 33 matches. “We have to manage better our attitude and our games,” Puel said. Ben FisherThe respect between Claudio Ranieri and Ryan Sessegnon was mutual after Fulham kickstarted their campaign with a pulsating victory over Southampton. From the player’s perspective, it has been heartening to see Ranieri waste no time making his presence felt after replacing Slavisa Jokanovic. “He wants us to defend as a team,” Sessegnon said. “Very tactical – more tactical with this guy than the last one. He’s really set down the way he wants to play.” Fulham have been vulnerable all season and Ranieri’s main focus is on tightening the worst defence in the league. The Italian is less concerned about his attack and praised Sessegnon for a vibrant display after seeing the 18-year-old winger create goals for Aleksandar Mitrovic and André Schürrle. “He’s one of the best young players that I’ve met,” Ranieri said. “He’s young, a child. It’s not easy for him, but I’m very pleased with his performance.” Jacob Steinberg• Match report: Fulham 3-2 Southampton• Soares critical of Southampton’s mental frailty in Fulham defeatCardiff made Everton work surprisingly hard for their win at Goodison, though Neil Warnock accepts he is going to have to spend money in January to give the club any chance of survival. “We will need to go shopping, I feel we will have to bring in a bit more quality to stay up,” the Cardiff manager said. “It is not easy to find players in January but two or three new players could improve the squad and give us a fighting chance. At the moment we have a right-back playing up front. He’s doing very well, but we need to be better.” Callum Paterson, the right-back in question, got himself in a great position to open the scoring in the first half, only to miss the target. A quality striker, or indeed any sort of recognised striker, might have put his side in front and increased the pressure on the home side. No one could fault the burly Paterson’s commitment or workrate, but his finishing possibly leaves something to be desired. Cardiff can still save themselves if they maximise their points return at home, but they are unlikely to do it with a right-back operating up front. Paul WilsonLiverpool are now 13 games unbeaten in the Premier League this season, with a record points tally for this stage of the season. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson have both been integral throughout thanks to their energetic attacking and defensive sturdiness, summed up by their efforts at Vicarage Road. The England right-back Alexander-Arnold whipped a free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards at a crucial point in the match to make it 2-0, showcasing another of his talents. Flying down either flank, he and Robertson instigated all of Liverpool’s counterattacking verve, a crucial aspect in tricky away games and one Watford could not cope with. As well as his superb attacking displays, in Robertson’s 12 league appearances this season Liverpool have kept eight clean sheets and he boasts five assists, more than any of his teammates, helping them to second in the table. Will UnwinAs a test of where West Ham are this season, how far they might have progressed under Manuel Pellegrini, the mauling by Manchester City revealed little to those watching from the stands. But for the Chilean there was much to take from it. His claims that West Ham were as dangerous as their opponents seemed thin (City could and would surely have scored more had they felt it necessary), but he had a broader point that was more convincing. In sticking at it, Pellegrini said, his team had shown “the mentality to play in the same way against every team”. If West Ham want to be a big team, they will have to impose their style on other teams consistently, regardless of the opponent. This has not always been the case in recent seasons. With eight matches before they face a top-six opponent again, West Ham now have the chance to prove Pellegrini’s theory on the pitch. Paul MacInnesThe headlines inevitably belonged to Aaron Mooy, but another man in the beating heart of the Huddersfield midfield was arguably the best player on the pitch at Molineux. Philip Billing again excelled, alongside Mooy and Jonathan Hogg, with the 22-year-old’s superb goal-line intervention keeping Raúl Jiménez at bay and a silky flick for the overlapping Florent Hadergjonaj showing both sides of his game they were contrasting moments, but both characteristic of another exuberant and mature display. Billing eats up ground, is unforgiving in the challenge but, perhaps most importantly, he possesses the guile to make a difference in both boxes. He was equally influential in the crucial victory at home to Fulham earlier this month and, as Huddersfield stretched their mini-unbeaten run to three matches, the great Dane put on another classy show. “He has grown,” his manager, David Wagner, said recently. “He has become a man.” Ben FisherYou could say this about a few teams at the moment, but Saturday’s win over Chelsea marked the start of a crucial few weeks in Tottenham’s season. On Wednesday they face Inter in the Champions League, then comes the north London derby at Arsenal, a couple of slightly more gentle league games against Leicester and Southampton before a trip to Barcelona. They realistically have to win both of those European games to progress and of course a victory at the Emirates is non-negotiable, but it’s not just the win over Chelsea that will provide encouragement, more the nature of it. Poor as Maurizio Sarri’s side were, Spurs overwhelmed them with exactly the right attitude and tactics, a combination they’ll most certainly need in the next few games. “Now the challenge for us is to keep that level of competition,” said Mauricio Pochettino after the game. It could define their season.

Does this mean that he’s attracted to this? Or that he is not straight? I am really freaked out and confused.On the contrary: be thankful that you are with a sexually curious person who may also be wonderfully creative and experimental. Many men enjoy dressing up in female attire. This does not mean they are gay – cross-dressers can be gay, straight or bisexual. For example, some heterosexual men just really like the feel of female clothing – soft, silky and so on – and have erotic sensations while wearing it. Your boyfriend may also have been researching this out of a passing interest.If you do discover he is drawn to it – or even has a strong fetishistic attachment to it – try not to feel threatened. It’s really OK – it’s just one of the many human variations of eroticism. People who like to cross-dress typically hide this interest because they fear judgment from others. Presumably you feel that you cannot discuss this with him until an opportunity arises that would not reveal you had been searching through his internet history. I recommend that if you were, say, to stumble upon visual cross-dressing material together at some point, that might be an ideal time to discuss the practice with him, in a totally nonjudgmental fashion.

I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience.

So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the .

How much it costs for pharmaceutical companies to create a new drug is hotly disputed, but recent figures place it at around $2.7bn. So it’s not a cheap business – but successful medicines can net a company astronomical profits.  ’s Sarah Boseley has been to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to find out how the world turned its back on infections and diseases in poor communities, where thousands of people have missed out on cures because they’re not an ‘attractive’ market. And Els Torreele, executive director of the MSF access campaign, explains why she believes big pharma has resisted finding cures for so long. Also today: from an exclusive interview with the , Hillary Clinton argues that Europe must curb immigration to stop rightwing populists gaining ground.

If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The much better news for her is that the attempted coup has revealed how relatively weak the ERG is, the attempt fizzling out when not enough MPs heeded its call to reach the 48 letters needed.That arguably takes May back to where she was at the start – having to factor in a relatively small if influential group of irreconcilables into her Commons mathematics.It is arguably a bit misleading to lump together all the non-ERGers, as their Brexit sympathies range from the broadly supportive, to diehard remainers such as Anna Soubry, who would most likely oppose any departure deal.As such, May has to once again present her Brexit plans as different things to different people, playing off each group’s aspirations and fears as best she can. A big part of this is likely to be based on using the vagueness of the political declaration on a future trading relationship as something on to which people can project their own ideas as to how it might play out.For the more centrist Tories, May’s pitch will be her standard one: this is the only deal in town it delivers the basics of what leavers voted for block it and you risk all manner of chaos, from a leadership challenge to a general election or a no-deal departure.When addressing her remain-minded MPs, May will seek to play up the softer elements of the deal, such as continued alignment with the EU, as well as raise fears over what she will pitch as the alternative: no deal.She could face an obstacle in this respect if some remainer Tories decide they might welcome the chaos of a rejected deal, seeing it as a way to potentially bring about a second referendum.May and her negotiators have spent many hours, days and weeks over the past year and a half trying to placate the party she relies on for her majority. But it appears to have been to no avail. The DUP’s position has been hardening from the moment the 585-page withdrawal agreement, containing the Irish backstop, dropped this month.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said explicitly on Saturday that her party intended to vote against the deal, not just abstain.Tory whips will no doubt stress the limited, “de-dramatised” nature of border checks and insist Stormont, as and when it gets up and running, will have some say in how EU rules are implemented in Northern Ireland if the backstop is invoked.Downing Street’s strongest argument is that both sides have committed to pressing ahead with trade talks in the new year in the hope the backstop will never be needed but the DUP does not appear to be in the mood to be persuaded. Its 10 MPs seem to be beyond May’s reach.Earlier in the autumn, Conservative whips were confident May’s deal would scrape through parliament with the help of a dozen or more Labour rebels – perhaps up to 30.As well as a small core of openly pro-Brexit MPs, such as Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, they hoped a swath of others from leave constituencies would back the deal rather than appear to be “blocking Brexit” and a third group of centrists would support the government, rather than risk the economic disruption of no deal.However, the newly rehabilitated cabinet minister Amber Rudd said last week she did not believe parliament would allow no deal to happen and Labour plans to table amendments to the meaningful vote to make it impossible.Taking it off the table would give wavering MPs a free pass, without the fear of unleashing chaos and many of those centrists that Tory whips were targeting are now shooting for a second referendum.Perhaps more importantly, some of those Labour MPs who had been most wary of rejecting the prime minister’s deal, including Wigan’s Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell in Stoke Central, have now suggested they will not vote for it.Nandy highlighted the vague nature of the 26-page political declaration other MPs in leave seats say they are hearing on the doorstep that even Brexit voters are not enthusiastic. Even Hoey appears likely to join Labour in the no lobby.As with her own MPs, May has to accept any PR pitch is to an extent a damage-limitation exercise, with significant percentages of the population never likely to be reconciled to her plans, not least the 700,000 or so people who marched in favour of a second referendum.The government is certainly thinking hard about how to put out the message that May’s deal is both inevitable and the only grown-up conclusion to 29 months of post-referendum arguments.This month a leaked memo supposedly setting out a sales pitch to the nation – dismissed as unofficial by Downing Street – laid out a schedule in which business leaders and foreign dignitaries were teed up to endorse May’s proposals.As with all the PM’s current Brexit sales pitches, the tone looks likely to be somewhat less elegiac than the sunlight uplands of unfettered prosperity set out by some leave campaigners, with the main message likely to be: this deal isn’t too bad, let’s get it over with.To an extent, this sense of ennui might be May’s greatest asset in selling her plan to the nation.Speaking on Sunday, her foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke of what he said were a significant group in Brexit Britain: those he termed the “Bobs” – people “bored of Brexit”. These are the people who might just accept May’s proposal because it finally brings the process to an end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbf141bf1a3604721a4f82d43b40e427faf0f4d/0_193_5749_3448/master/5749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9f508d9aa52419853ee40fce6a2fdd","title":"labour argues for article 50 extension if brexit deal voted down","story":"Keir Starmer says Theresa May and EU27 could extend talks if UK ends up with no dealThe government and the EU could be persuaded to extend the Brexit process if Theresa May’s deal is voted down by MPs, Labour has argued, as ministers begin the task of trying to sell the agreement to the country.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said May had “run down the clock” with her Brexit talks, meaning that to renegotiate a better permanent deal would probably require article 50 to be extended beyond March next year.If the only alternative was the chaos of no deal, then May and the EU27 would back down and allow this, Starmer argued.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.However, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was sent out to extol the merits of the deal agreed in Brussels on Sunday, said that if MPs voted down the deal “we go into uncharted waters”. “This is the best deal, and it’s also the only deal, and EU leaders have made that clear,” he said.May was expected to make the same point in a statement to parliament later on Monday, warning MPs that failing to back the deal would take Britain “back to square one”.Barclay conceded it would be difficult to get the deal through parliament, but said the cabinet needed to make the case, for it.“I don’t pretend for a minute it’s not a challenging task given where the numbers currently look,” he told Sky News. “But this is a good deal that respects the referendum result.“And we need to be clear with parliamentary colleagues as to what the alternative will be, which will be massive uncertainty from either no deal or no Brexit. That’s not in the interests of their constituents or in the interests of protecting jobs. It gives uncertainty to EU citizens in areas like the NHS.”Starmer dismissed that forecast, saying Labour’s main concern was with the vagueness of the agreement on a future relationship.“It is a problem, and it’s a problem the prime minister has really got us into, because over the two years she has effectively run down the clock,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We had a snap general election at the beginning of the exercise, which wasted the first few months. We had months and months and months of waiting for Chequers. The frustration in Brussels during that time was: ‘We don’t really know what you’re asking us for’. We only got Chequers in June and here we are.“And to be honest, all the stuff about extended transition, all the stuff about backstop, that’s insurance policies because the future arrangements, the future relationship, is not nailed down because that bit hasn’t been really negotiated over the past two years. That’s a massive failure.”If the deal was voted down, Starmer said it would probably take political pressure from MPs to avoid the alternative of a no deal, and the agreement of the EU to extend article 50.“If you had a vast majority saying we don’t authorise the government to leave with no deal, it would be very difficult politically to do so. I accept that might not be legally binding,” he said.“I accept that stopping no deal is something that’s going to have to involve the whole of the EU, but I think there would be a very strong push by the majority in parliament against no deal. And I don’t think this prime minister would simply plough on regardless, because she knows how dangerous no deal is.”The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspSome reports have said May plans to challenge Jeremy Corbyn to a TV debate on the merits of her deal, something the Labour leader has agreed to do. Barclay told Sky he could not confirm it.Asked why May planned to send herself and ministers around the UK to sell the deal, when it was MPs who would decide, Barclay said: “MPs themselves gave this decision to the public, MPs voted to have a referendum, to give the public a say. So it’s quite right that we take our case to the public. It was their vote.”Speaking later on Today, Barclay dismissed fears the UK could be endlessly stuck in backstop arrangements over issues such as fishing, which has been raised as a concern by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.“It’s not in the EU’s interests for their own trade negotiations, because one of the key points when you’re negotiating trade is to be clear on the size of the market, and you couldn’t do that if it was unclear if the UK was in or out.”Barclay said he hoped to be able to sell the deal to fellow Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs: “It’s a deal for Brexiteers like me which delivers on key things we campaigned for. It allows a skills-based immigration system, it allows an independent coastal state, so we have control of our fishing, we control of our money, border and laws.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

The management and players have been incredible to work with and the tremendous support we have had, particularly at home in the Aviva, but where ever we have travelled has been uplifting.“Thank you to the IRFU for their support and patience and thanks also to so many people who have adopted my family and me, making us feel part of the community here in Ireland.“There are some inspiring challenges over the next 11 months so there’s plenty of motivation for me to continue working hard, alongside the other management staff, so that the team can be as competitive as possible.”Farrell is currently the Ireland defence coach and the appointment will be his first in a head coach role. “It is a privilege to be considered for such a prestigious role,” he said. “I have learned a lot from Joe over the past few seasons and I will continue to learn from him over the next year as the coaching group and players focus on competing in two huge tournaments in 2019.”Schmidt was named as coach of the year, with Johnny Sexton awarded the player of the year, at Sunday night’s World Rugby Awards in Monaco, after a year in which Ireland won a grand slam in the Six Nations and beat the All Blacks for the second time in their history.David Nucifora, the IRFU performance director, added: “Joe’s contribution to Irish rugby is broader than just the success achieved with the national team. He has had a hugely positive influence on the entire professional system with both his rugby intellect and his eagerness to invest in and develop both players and coaches throughout the country.“We are all clearly aware and thankful of the better place that Joe will be leaving Irish Rugby in post the Rugby World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53e21439bd22d33f3466ec9ee143e9fe3438b5f2/0_165_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1ef9a19bba6097d8fb93d88d587d36","title":"womens t20 cricket included 2022 commonwealth games","story":"Women’s T20 cricket is strongly in the running to be admitted as a new sport to the schedule at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022.A joint bid between the International Cricket Council and England and Wales Cricket Board was submitted last week before a vital presentation to the organising committee of the event next Monday. If an endorsement is won at that stage, the Commonwealth Games Federation will then make the final decision, to be ratified by September next year.According to the submission, Edgbaston would be the primary venue for the eight-team competition, with county grounds at Worcester, Derbyshire and Leicester under consideration to serve as the secondary host during the group stages.That each of the games would be broadcast live on BBC television has been described as “an absolute game-changer” by Clare Connor, the director of England Women’s Cricket. She has been steering the process from an ECB perspective in collaboration with an ICC working group led by Iain Higgins, the governing body’s chief operating officer.“One of the things we have noticed is the more we have worked on this, the more passionate and committed people have become,” Connor told the .“People really tune into Olympic and Commonwealth Games, watching sports they normally wouldn’t watch and are inspired by them. So it would be a different audience from a typical cricket tournament. So the benefits for women’s cricket are very obvious.”The sport stood a strong chance of admission for the original host city for 2022, Durban. When the shift to Birmingham was decided upon at the start of 2018, the formal process started again. Sports that are seeking admission alongside women’s cricket are archery, shooting, para-table tennis and volleyball but they will not be competing for a fixed number of spots – the organising committee can give the green light to any contender that meets its criteria.“I hope our bid will be strong because it fits with what the Commonwealth Games are looking to do around equality,” she said. “One of their three core values is equality and they are, like most organisations or sports in a healthy place, looking to create more opportunities for female athletes and this would mean eight teams of female athletes. It is also really powerful that women’s cricket could be in on its own, standing there in its own right.”The top-eight ranked T20 sides would be granted qualification. The complication, as it was in 1998, is West Indies, who represent several nations. It is understood they would be asked to nominate one country from the region to take part as an imperfect solution to the problem.The paperwork submitted the Friday before last will be augmented with a series of visual presentations next Monday and Tuesday to Birmingham 2022 decision-makers. Mindful of how important this will be, the ICC will be represented by David Richardson, their chief executive. The board of the organisation has already given the bid its full support.“We have submitted a really strong case,” Connor said. “We are a sport with such an amazing heritage but are also looking to be modern and be dynamic and inclusive too, just as the Commonwealth are. We are a sport that is constantly proving itself and growing in audience, fans and media engagement. So for all those reasons, I am confident. We have a chance to stand in front of them next week and really bring this to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a126aae309c1647a56268b52304193e47a72ff61/281_100_3370_2023/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faf630e68c8799812dc17c7aea4c0854","title":"sri lanka v england third test day four live","story":"Ben Foakes is man of the series. Quite a thing, considering he wasn’t even in the squad at the start of the series, and even then brought in as a specialist keeper and he ended up as the top run-scorer for both teams. “I’m just going with the flow really,” he handsomely says. Jonny Bairstow is named man of the match for his superb 110 in the first innings. “It’s been an up and down series for me,” he understates. He’s cagey about whether the No.3 spot is now his own, but he’ll almost certainly be there for the West Indies series at least. Quite a performance from England, all told. Of course, there are the caveats about this Sri Lanka side, in transition anyway after the last of this generation’s greats retired following the first Test but who have been without a couple of big players at various parts of the series: they are, in short, no good. But for England to whitewash their first overseas, three Test series since 1963, at the start of the post-Alastair Cook era, is still a significant achievement. “I’m absolutely knackered,” notes Jack Leach. “It was quite a big moment, I think,” he continues, offering significant understatement about the run-out that he manufactured with a brilliant throw down of the stumps. Well, a much better day of cricket than anticipated, but the result most expected eventually. Sri Lanka batted as well as England bowled badly at times, particularly Kusal Mendis, Roshen da Silva and Malinda Pushpakumara at the end there. But it was fitting that Jack Leach took the clinching wicket at the end there: superb figures of 28.2-4-72-4, which would have been even better had Pushpakumara not chanced his arm for a bit. Umpire’s call! My days, clipping leg stump, and that’s the match! Leach traps Lakmal lbw, the finger goes up but Mr DRS will decide for certain...We’re back out. For how long?Peter Salmon has drifted off into a reverie about old friends: “Yes great year, thanks to everyone at OBO. Highlight of course was Cook’s last match. Wonder what he’s doing now. Half nine in the UK, I imagine he’s cut come firewood into absolutely equal lengths, made the family breakfast, boiled eggs with soldiers cut into absolutely equal lengths, and is now off down the shops for a Farmer’s Weekly and some fresh bread from the local baker. But still time to chat to the postie! Miss him I do.”“Alternatively the fourth umpire’s leather briefcase might contain ‘My dirty undies, Dude. The laundry. The whites.....’” offers Kevin Ryan. And that’s tea. England obviously need the one wicket, but at the very least Sri Lanka are making it ticklish for them. Leach and bits of Moeen’s latter spell aside, England haven’t really bowled well, and as Mike Atherton said on commentary, have had the air of a side who expected to rock up and be awarded the win. It’s been a much more interesting day than we expected. 86th over: Sri Lanka 284-9 (Lakmal 11, Pushpakumara 42) - 43 runs required to win Well looky here, it’s Stuart Broad for the first time today. And the first ball hits Pushpakumara on the head, as he tries to sway out of the way of a short one. Nasty. He needs a little attention from the physio, clearly a little shaken but he carries on. He ducks nicely away from the next one, then gets off strike with a single. Good stuff.85th over: Sri Lanka 281-9 (Lakmal 10, Pushpakumara 41) - 46 runs required to win Lakmal brilliantly back cuts for four, and that’s Root’s cue to ask for the new ball. Mo will have five balls with it, the first of which Lakmal flicks for a single to bring up the 50 partnership: fine batting from the pair of them. Pushpakumara sweeps another four, and England are definitely getting twitchy now. 84th over: Sri Lanka 271-9 (Lakmal 5, Pushpakumara 36) “May I just register my strong objection to this gratuitous casual postponementcancellation of the tea interval,” writes stickler for tradition Kim Thonger. “Some things should be sacrosanct and afternoon tea is one of them. Furthermore, what happens to the Victoria sponge if tea isn’t taken at all and they move straight to champagne victory celebration? You can’t eat sponge cake with champagne, it’s terribly déclassé.”While Kim is pondering light refreshments, Pushmakumara sweeps, not entirely convincingly, but gets two runs for it. 56 required now...83rd over: Sri Lanka 267-9 (Lakmal 4, Pushpakumara 33) “Why not just all the OBO writers gather in a pub to discuss the year’s cricket while someone liveblogs the discussion. I’d follow that!” writes Robin Hazlehurst. Bless you Robin, but I suspect only you and our mums would read that. And even then, my ma is quite busy. And it wasn’t just desperation! The ball missed the inside-edge, and was going down leg so the lbw was out of the question too. Lakmal is given out for a caught behind, but obviously he has to review it...82nd over: Sri Lanka 266-9 (Lakmal 4, Pushpakumara 32) Pushmakumara continues to Go For It: he clears the front leg and hammers one just past mid-off and to the boundary, but is then banjaxed by a googly. Hit the pad but was turning too much. Stuart Broad is loosening - the fourth umpire is waiting at the boundary edge with what looks like a leather satchel. Presumably contains some important papers, his lunch and some new balls. 81st over: Sri Lanka 260-9 (Lakmal 3, Pushpakumara 27) “Would England not prefer tea to be taken, given it’s pretty much guaranteed to result in a wicket the 1st over after tea?” asks Hugh Maguire. Possibly, but I don’t think that’s how these things are decided. After a two and a pair of singles, Sri Lanka now need 67 to win. When do England fans start getting nervous? The new ball is available, should Root want it. 80th over: Sri Lanka 256-9 (Lakmal 2, Pushpakumara 24) Here’s Dilly Rashid to, Joe Root hopes, mop up this last wicket. He doesn’t, at least not in that over. Incidentally, technically it’s tea time but I assume we’ll just be carrying on until there’s a result. 79th over: Sri Lanka 255-9 (Lakmal 2, Pushpakumara 23) Pushpakumara goes big at Mo but only gets an inside edge. Then one spits off the pitch and misses everything, including Foakes, and Sri Lanka collect four byes. “As we near The End, thanks to all the OBO writers for another enjoyable year,” very nicely writes John Starbuck. “Is it too much to hope that the  will do a 2018 OBO highlights piece?”We’ll do a series wrap of some description I’m sure, but not sure what form it will take. Thanks anyway John, from all of us. 78th over: Sri Lanka 249-9 (Lakmal 1, Pushpakumara 22) Pushpakumara is playing England like a fiddle here. Sort of. He sweeps a full one to mid-wicket, then cuts the overcorrection to point, then goes one (two) better with a honking great six straight down the ground. It will almost certainly be in vain, but this is a fun way to finish. 77th over: Sri Lanka 235-9 (Lakmal 1, Pushpakumara 8) Big lbw shout but again there was an inside-edge from Lakmal, who follows it up with a big hoy that drops short of long-on. Then two more pleading, begging, loud lbw appeals, neither of which are given, and as it turns out correctly. No reviews left for England, remember. 76th over: Sri Lanka 235-9 (Lakmal 1, Pushpakumara 8) Leach is haemorrhaging runs now: five from the over! Five! (5)! A single, then quite a nice Pushpakumara sweep past fine leg to the boundary. Quick reminder that Sri Lanka need 92 more runs to win. 75th over: Sri Lanka 230-9 (Lakmal 0, Pushpakumara 4) Pushpakumara begins like he’s going to lose having a bit of fun, lashing a wide half-volley to the boundary. “What has been the funnest moment of the series?” writes Alexander Howard Jones, chartered analyst. “Mine is Joe Root coming out at number 4 in the second innings of the second test, after Leach was nightwatchman.”Root’s commitment to his position was quite excellent. Any other nominations? No dice. That woody noise came from - wait for it - his bat. Looks like a pretty hopeful one because there was a very woody noise from Pushpakumara, but England are going upstairs to get this wrapped before tea.And it did just flick the pad, going on to hit the top of middle-off! What a review! Last rites now for Sri Lanka.Roshen goes back to Mo, appears to chop it point-wards but England think it hit his pad first. Upstairs we go...74th over: Sri Lanka 226-8 (Roshen 65, Lakmal 0) I bring you the startling news that Leach has conceded a run, to Roshen as he ran down the track to the last ball of the over, desperate to retain strike. Leach’s figures balloon to 26-4-53-3 for the innings. 73rd over: Sri Lanka 225-8 (Roshen 64, Lakmal 0) “On the subject of things that don’t happen but should (appealing when the batsman picks it up),” writes Ian Forth, “why do umpires never mention they’re checking that the bowler’s arm has straightened more than the specified number of degrees on DRS? It’s part of the laws of the game, after all.”Unless someone who knows better can correct me, I’d assume it’s as simple as they already have lots to think about with those DRSs. If the umps suspected someone was chucking, they might ask the question. Bounce from Mo, Perera flicks it onto his thigh pad and the Great Black Hole of Jennings swallows the thing at short-leg. 72nd over: Sri Lanka 224-7 (Roshen 63, Perera 5) Leach has been on the button since returning to the attack: that’s a third maiden on the bounce, so his figures in this spell read 4-3-4-1. And that four was Dickwella’s boundary, who he got out the ball after. Decent. 71st over: Sri Lanka 224-7 (Roshen 63, Perera 5) Roshen defends one then picks the ball up to give to the fielders - why on earth do batsmen do that? It would be v poor form, but one day an enterprising captain is going to appeal from one of those. 70th over: Sri Lanka 222-7 (Roshen 61, Perera 5) Even though he’s played very well, Roshen is still being troubled by Leach, to the tune of a semi-decent lbw shout and one that ripped past his edge.

It was a haunt of the early jet-set crowd – everyone from the Queen to Ian Fleming was entertained at Coward’s modest villa.The one-bedroom property is a National Heritage Site and is open to the public throughout the year (entrance US$15).

Using the shell of an old warehouse at 41 Fleet Street as a canvas, they covered the walls in murals, which have now spread up and down the road.Across from the main building is the most incredible urban garden, Life Yard. The almost hidden entrance between two houses leads into a farm, which feeds a community and supplies the vegan and vegetarian restaurant hidden away behind the street’s walls. This serves Rastafarian Ital food, a natural way of cooking that avoids processed food, additives, oil, salt and sugar. Try the pine (apple) and ginger juice – it’s to die for (J$250, around £1.50).Life Yard is a good example of how community action can revitalise parts of the inner- city. It’s run by Shane Morgan, who grew up in this part of downtown and is an amazing guide to the area.• lifeyard.orgCoffee was first planted in Jamaica in 1728, and the island is famous for its Blue Mountain beans (however, most of the island’s supply has historically been exported to its biggest market, Japan). Deaf Can Coffee in Kingston is a social enterprise set up to empower the deaf community, and here they are trained in all things coffee, from planting to roasting the company also works alongside existing coffee shops to provide baristas around the island.

But because of the regulations regarding medical marijuana, the herb houses tend to be either too clinical or too touristy. Kaya is a dispensary just outside the tourist resort town of Ocho Rios that gets it just right. It’s a great spot to grab a Marley coffee and enjoy a variety of ganja-based products (from US$10 a gram) in a smoke lounge with a good vibe.

But I say, ‘No. He’s talking about all of us. He’s got something against Mexico … and against all Latin American people.’”Martínez is one of a growing number of US Hiic people looking towards their family’s European past as a possible means of safeguarding their future.He recently began the process of trying to obtain Spanish citizenship under a law that offers it to the descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the country in 1492, forced to convert to Catholicism or burned at the stake.“I’m very proud of my past and my culture,” says Martínez. “And that’s why I want to see whether I can become a Spanish citizen. I have Catholic, Jewish and Moorish roots there.”Applications received by the Jewish Federation of New Mexico, which has been certifying applicants’ Sephardic heritage, suggest Martínez is not alone in seeking an insurance policy in the form of Spanish citizenship.The “bam!” moment, according to Sara Koplik, the federation’s director of community outreach, came two years ago. And its timing was more than a coincidence.Although the Spanish citizenship law had come into force the previous October, the gesture of redress was, initially at least, scarcely taken up in New Mexico, whose original Spanish settlers included a large number of conversos – forced converts – who had fled the inquisitions in both Spain and Mexico. The first two or three dozen requests came from Hiic Catholic families with extensive genealogies, or people with professional connections to Spain.Application numbers remained low throughout summer and early autumn 2016, but all that changed with Trump’s triumph.“With the election in November 2016 it was ‘bam!’ and our numbers started to go up significantly,” says Koplik. “Before the election, we issued maybe 20 or 30 certificates. But we have now issued 1,500 – from multiple countries.”Koplik, a historian, is careful to point out that her team has received applications from more than 50 countries. Most however, come from just three: the US, Mexico and Venezuela.“It’s a big jump and of course some of it had nothing to do with the United States – it has to do with Venezuela and violence in Mexico – but for Americans, they see this as an insurance policy just in case, against hatred,” she says.“We know Jewish history, and unfortunately Latinos who have Jewish heritage also have that history of putting things in hiding, being secretive, protecting yourself to survive. In both of these cultures, there’s this instinct to just have a plan B, just something a little extra just in case. And this fits very well into those ideas of, ‘Oh well, if things don’t go well in the US … If racism increases, OK, then there might be another way forward.’”Not all the US applicants, however, are motivated by fear.For Ricardo Villarreal, a business professor who grew up in Texas, it is a matter of making sense of the Jewish customs that suffused his mother’s ostensibly Catholic upbringing, and honouring his ancestors.“The opportunity came up and I just thought, ‘Holy smoke!’ You have to do it for the extent to which my family left Spain and how I’m still descended from them,” he says. “I almost think you have to do it for them.”The citizenship offer stirred something similarly atavistic in Georgina Garza and her siblings, who are descended from conversos, and whose family has lived around the Rio Grande valley for 500 years.“Spain is calling us I really believe there is a connection with our ancestors and they want us to go back,” says Georgina, a dyslexia therapist, bilingual teacher and rehabilitation therapist.Her brother Juan says: “We’re not like the Sephardic Jews who were expelled and went to north Africa or the Middle East or Europe, because they could carry on practising their religion. It was different for us. But this new law is helping us connect with our past and we’re discovering – or rediscovering – things that have been lost for 500 years.”Rob Martínez, who has studied and worked in Spain, also feels a deep affinity with the country.“I’d be delighted to have that identity because we still have a very strong Hiic culture even if our Spanish isn’t quite as refined as the Spanish in Mexico or Spain,” he says. “We’ve been Americans for almost two centuries, but we’re still speaking Spanish.”But for Martínez, whose father was a celebrated New Mexican mariachi, composer of ballads and civil rights campaigner, the social realities of Trump’s America remain a powerful spur.“I want to stay here and fight against this cabrón. But if things go bad, I’ll be able to go to Spain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d12c11f042eb0c148fab58e6e44ec4f88c39aba8/0_127_4686_2814/master/4686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f7503d8e60b703df7a86abdb5ab96c","title":"india worlds tallest statue plan to build a taller one uttar pradesh hindu go ram","story":"Uttar Pradesh will build a 221m-high effigy of the Hindu god Ram, dwarfing the current record-holder in Gujarat stateThe Indian state of Uttar Pradesh says it will build the world’s tallest statue, weeks after the current record holder – an 182-metre likeness of founding father Sardar Patel – was completed in another part of the country.If constructed, the 221m-high effigy of the Hindu god Ram in the town of Ayodhya could make India home to the world’s three tallest statues, with a 212-metre likeness of the medieval ruler Shivaji also currently under construction off the coast of Mumbai.Plans for the bronze Ram statue were unveiled over the weekend, with five construction firms giving presentations to the the state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu monk accused of instigating violence against’s the state’s Muslim minority.Ayodhya has been considered a crucible for the Hindu nationalist movement since 1992, when thousands of adherents stormed a Mughal-era mosque in the town and demolished it, believing it was built at the site where Ram was born, and where an ancient Hindu temple had been torn down by earlier Muslim rulers.The demolition triggered riots in which nearly 2,000 people died. Several senior officials from the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, including former government ministers and serving state governors, have been indicted for instigating the destruction of the mosque.An estimated 50,000 Hindu nationalists rallied in Ayodhya on Sunday demanding prime minister Narendra Modi’s party build a temple to Ram on the site.“Do whatever it is you have to do,” Uddhav Thackeray, the leader of the far-right Shiv Sena group, said on Sunday. “A temple has to be built. This government is very powerful and if they don’t build a temple they will not be in government.”Successive BJP governments have promised to build a Ram temple on the site but say they are unable to do so until the Indian supreme court rules on how the land should be used. The court will hold hearings on the issue next year.The statue – along with a decision this month to rename the surrounding district from its Mughal-era name Faizabad to Ayodhya – are seen as efforts to temper the anger of rightwing Hindu groups at the continued delay in building the temple, despite the fact religious nationalists are in power nationally and in states across the country.The cost of the statue is yet to be announced but is also likely to provoke criticism in a state with the country’s highest levels of malnutrition, and where 325 children died in a single month last year when a government hospital was unable to afford to maintain oxygen supplies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710659.1543228196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"significant change in weather predicted as storm diana approaches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMet Éireann says conditions are due to turn wet and windy in coming days.

The investigation is called the Implant Files.As part of the project an online database, the International Medical Devices Database, has been developed by the ICIJ. It allows easy public access to data on adverse events linked to, or potentially linked, to medical devices.The database, which mostly involves US reports, can be searched by product name so that implant recipients can access information about their devices. However, it is not intended to be a substitute for medical advice.While there is extensive information about possible medical device failures available publicly in the US, and less so in EU member states, the Implant Files investigation has found that fewer than 20 per cent of countries globally make data available to the public on device recalls and other safety issues.In Ireland, data about safety notices and device recalls is published on the HPRA website.The investigation has raised concerns about devices that have been withdrawn in one country for safety reasons still being available in others.Orthopaedic, gastroenterological, urological and cardiovascular devices show the highest level of recalls for safety reasons in the US.An examination of millions of US adverse event reports found almost 500,000 cases where patients with implanted medical devices were getting them removed, or “explanted”.Figures given to The  by the HPRA for the period 2015-2018 show that last year there were 1,041 adverse “incidents” reported to the authority.An adverse incident is an unexpected bad medical development that may be associated with a patient’s medical device, and is different from an “adverse event” which, in HPRA terminology, involves bad health episodes that would be expected with patients using the device concerned – for example, those with very weak hearts.The adverse incident figure for 2016 was 859, while the figure for 2018 to the end of September was 838.Of the 1,041 incidents reported in 2017, investigations have been completed in 594 cases and, of these, 156 were found to have been definitively linked to the patient’s medical device.Overall, 80 per cent of the 2017 cases for which investigations have been concluded were found to be incidents which were caused, directly or partly, by the medical device, or which led to the manufacturer taking some type of corrective action. The rate was slightly less in other years.Medical device manufacturers are obliged to report adverse health outcomes that might be linked to their devices to the HPRA. Medical practitioners and others are also urged to report suspected cases.The figures supplied by the HPRA show that the bulk of the incident reports it receives come from manufacturers and that there has been a steady rise in the total number of reports over recent years, with the total in 2011 being just 112.The head of medical device regulation with the HPRA, Dr Niall MacAleenan, said the increase was mostly due to the drive to encourage better reporting. The authority conducts audits on manufacturers to ensure they are complying with their obligations.There was a spike in reports in 2012, when the total jumped to 706 from the previous year’s 408. Dr MacAleenan said this was due to the DePuy metal hip device, which has since been removed from the market.Globally DePuy, which is a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, is expected to pay out up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages and patient care costs arising from the withdrawn device.Ireland had the largest per capita uptake of the DePuy hip in the world and an examination of how the product came to market is published today by The . More than 1,000 people have lodged High Court proceedings against DePuy.The DePuy hip controversy, and a scandal over industrial grade silicone being used in breast implants, led to the decision to reform the EU system of medical device regulation. The new structure is likely to see increased levels of clinical trials being conducted, according to Dr MacAleenan.The reforms are also expected to lead to greater levels of information being put into the public domain.Medical devices require a different type of regulation to that of pharmaceuticals, not least because they are often designed to be inside a patient’s body for years, according to Dr MacAleenan.“Risk is inevitable with implanted devices. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”The Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament, Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiation of the new EU regime, said parts of the structure that were being replaced were “not fit for purpose”.However, she said it was important that an industry that was constantly producing new products that save lives and address chronic medical conditions was not over-regulated.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she told The .Ireland is a global hub for medical devices, which account for almost 10 per cent of its exports.Last Wednesday the Department of Health extended restrictions on the use of a medical device product, the vaginal mesh, in relation to some conditions. The mesh has caused severe complications in a number of women including damage caused by bits of the mesh breaking off and cutting through patients’ flesh. The product can be extremely difficult to explant as the body grows around and into it.Josephine Kilroy (58), from Newport, Co Mayo, who received a mesh implant in 2007 to treat a bladder problem, is hoping that it can be removed early next year by a surgeon in London.The former taxi operator said pain and other complications associated with the device had caused her to be all but confined to her home.“I went from having everything, and being happy, to losing everything, all because of the mesh.

Total employment, in indigenous and multinational businesses, is 38,000.Four out of five of stents used worldwide are produced in Ireland. Half of the ventilators used in acute hospitals worldwide are produced here, as are a third of the world’s contact lenses. More than 30 million people with diabetes use injectable devices made in Ireland.Europe’s premier cluster of medical devices companies is based in the Galway region, according to Enterprise Ireland.Abbott, Stryker, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Shire and Boston Scientific are among the top global medical device corporations that have substantial operations here employing large numbers of skilled staff.The industry and its regulatory framework have come in for scrutiny after several companies – including some with significant Irish operations – made multimillion-dollar settlements in the United States arising from investigations into bribery and scandals linked to the promotion of their products.Last year Shire, a biopharmaceutical corporation that has its headquarters on Baggot Street in Dublin, but has its main operational base in the US, made a $350 million false claims settlement with the US authorities arising from an investigation into the payment of kickbacks.The kickback payments were linked to sales of Dermagraft, a human skin substitute approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It was the largest ever kickback settlement involving a medical device and involved allegations that “Dermagraft salespersons unlawfully induced clinics and physicians with lavish dinners, drinks, entertainment and travel, medical equipment and supplies, unwarranted payments for purported speaking engagements and bogus case studies, and cash, credits and rebates, to induce the use of Dermagraft.” The settlement did not involve Shire admitting to any wrongdoing.Also last year Medtronic, the world’s largest manufacturer of medical devices, which has had its headquarters in Dublin since the formerly US corporation moved here in 2015, agreed to pay $12 million in the US in settlement of claims that it paid millions of dollars in consulting fees to doctors who published studies in peer-reviewed journals that downplayed the adverse effects of a Medtronic product.Medtronic said in a statement at the time that nothing in the settlement could be taken as a concession that it admitted to wrongdoing.The controversial articles concerned a bone-growth protein, Infuse, which had been approved for use in surgery for lower back pain but was used extensively for upper spine and neck repairs, sometimes leading to death and serious injury. Such off-label use is legal but cannot be promoted by the manufacturer.An investigation in 2012 by the US Senate finance committee found Medtronic had been “heavily involved” in shaping the content of published studies on Infuse.The committee said Medtronic had been “involved in drafting, editing and shaping the content of medical journal articles authored by its physician consultants who received significant amounts of money through royalties and consulting fees from Medtronic”.In Europe Infuse was marketed under the name InductOS. Its use in the European Union was suspended in 2015 because of concerns with the manufacturing process involved.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (J\u0026ampJ), which operates a number of major plants in Ireland, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities in 2011 and paid a $21.4 million fine arising from the bribery of doctors in Greece.The bribery involved payments to Greek hospital doctors to encourage them to use orthopaedic products produced by the J\u0026ampJ subsidiary DePuy, which has operations in Ireland. Documents published by the US department of justice (DoJ) show the bribery operation was discussed by DePuy executives who met at a conference in Dublin in 2000.DePuy orthopaedic products were sold at significant discounts to an Isle of Man intermediary in order to produce profits that could then be used for bribing the Greek doctors for implanting the devices into their patients.The US investigation concluded that between 1996 and 2006, DePuy authorised payments of about €16.4 million to Greek agents knowing that much of the money would be used to pay cash incentives to publicly-employed Greek doctors to induce them to use DePuy products in their patients.In a “deferred prosecution agreement” published in 2011, J\u0026ampJ agreed that the facts outlined were true and accurate.The contribution to humanity of the medical device sector over recent decades has been enormous, says Pandit.“A few decades ago, cardiac surgery for a person in their 70s would have been unthinkable. Now it can be done in minimally invasive ways. A heart valve put into a 60-year-old is likely to last for 20 years, but now it is possible to put in a new one.”He has faith in the medical and research journals and the tests and studies done on medical devices, despite the well-aired issue of financial links between manufacturers and the physicians and scientists who are reviewing their products.Because bodies are so complex, there is a huge range of reactions across a population to a particular implanted device. This makes it difficult to fully test a product prior to its being released to the market.“It is a risk-to-benefit ratio. We can do as much as we can to show that the thing is safe to put in the body. The way to look at it is, in the circumstances, would I put this in my mother’s body, or in my father’s eye? Would I put it in my own body?”Pandit says Ireland’s corporation tax rate is not the sole reason for its relatively enormous medtech sector. “It is just the icing on the cake. The ecosystem is the thing, and the English language. The labour force is highly trained, and the higher-education institutes are equipped for clinical trials. It’s well-rooted. I’m not saying that tax doesn’t help, but it’s more than that.”Galway is part of the constituency of the Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiations on a new regulatory regime for the medical devices sector in the EU.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she says.While it is crucial that trust is maintained in the medical device sector, the benefits to the community of successful medical devices are enormous and it is important that it is not made too difficult for companies to bring new products to market, McGuinness says.Concerns exist over the extent to which the new regime which is to be put in place by 2020 can be sufficiently resourced with skilled staff.The system involves “notified bodies” giving CE marks to new medical device products, with certification from any notified body allowing a product on to the entire EU market.One of the recognised problems with the old regime was the closeness between the industry and some of the private, commercial bodies that were charged with certifying new products for the market. Ireland’s notified body, the Irish National Standards Authority, is publicly owned and highly regarded. However, the number of extant medical devices that it has given approval for numbers in the low hundreds.That close collaboration with industry is necessary is a view shared by Dr Martin O’Halloran, a senior lecturer in medical electronics in NUIG.O’Halloran is director of the Translation Medical Device Lab, which is embedded in Galway University Hospital and is focused on Ireland’s indigenous medtech sector and the development of new products.“What we do is evaluate the commercial potential at the outset,” says O’Halloran. “It means that for anything that is developed there will be an appetite for it.”People at an early stage of their career are recruited from university and sent into hospital to “look for problems that need to be solved”. They then look for people with specialist knowledge. A specialist team of three members is often formed, with a clinical doctor, an engineer and a commercial person working together. Often these teams can end up creating a start-up company around their proposed medical device.O’Halloran works on the electrical properties of human tissue and is currently working on a microwave imaging device for breast cancer screening.A lot of contemporary work is being led by engineering, he says. “The next generation of medical devices will be electro-mechanical. It will be smart or personalised devices that don’t just treat disease but preserve the quality of life.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709919.1543161217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"medical devices often allowed onto market without human tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs part of EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies.The regulation of medical devices in the European Union is a national competency, unlike with pharmaceuticals, which are regulated centrally by the European Medicines Agency.Each member state has a regulator, which in turn authorises notified bodies which can award CE marks. The mark indicates the product conforms with the health, safety and environmental protection standards of the European Economic Area which includes the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.The CE mark awarded by a notified body in one member state allows the product be marketed across the union. Furthermore, the awarding of a CE mark also serves to open up other markets around the globe, where many poorer countries are reliant on the EU and US regulatory regimes.In Ireland the regulator is the Health Products Regulation Agency (HPRA), which has authorised the State-owned Irish National Standards Authority to act as a notified body.Other jurisdictions have more than one notified body, and some of these notified bodies were commercial operations reliant on the fees they received from the manufacturers whose products they were able to grant or deny access to the market. It was a system that was only as strong as its weakest link.As part of the EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies and notified bodies, as well as increased oversight by the European Commission. This, and new, higher standards that are being imposed, has seen a reduction in the number of notified bodies in the EU from 81 to 56 over recent years.Fine Gael MEP Mairéad McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament, was actively involved in the reform process. The metal hip controversy, and the PIP breast implant scandal, caused the EU to take a closer look at a regulatory system that did not appear to be working. “The notified bodies and their relationships with industry was one of the questions raised,” says McGuinness.Officials from the commission’s directorate on health and food safety, which is based in Co Meath, went out to the member states and closed down a number of notified bodies, she says, some of which were “not fit for purpose”.Now that a more robust system is being put in place, the challenge is to get the people with the required skills. “People want less bureaucracy but more safety, but that takes more regulation and it takes resources,” says McGuinness.Brexit is not helping matters as the UK’s four notified bodies currently account for a large proportion of the new medical devices that get CE marks ever year. It is likely the UK notified bodies will open offices in other EU member states so they can continue working, but the disruption is another complication at a time when the system is undergoing reform, the number of new technologies seeking certification continues to grow, and the number of notified bodies is being reduced.“The industry is moving so fast and so furiously,” says McGuinness. “There is a need to draw people out from industry to work on regulation, as no one else would know the necessary detail.”Medical devices are often not screened by way of clinical trials before they are approved for the market, in the way new drugs are, but this is because they act in a fundamentally different way, says Dr Niall MacAleenan, head of the medical devices section at the HPRA.Innovative devices that have been developed over recent years have transformed medical services, saved and extended countless lives, and provided ways to ease the suffering of huge numbers of people with chronic conditions. Stents have transformed cardiac care, while insulin pumps, pain-management devices and improved prosthetics have brought relief to tens of millions.In part because medical technology has been so successful, the devices that are now available are often inside people’s bodies for years, if not decades. Also new, high-risk technologies introduced for people with conditions likely to cause death if not untreated sometimes become less risky as they are developed over time and surgeons become more skilled at implanting them, thereby changing the risk-benefit analysis.For these and other reasons, new devices are often allowed on to the market after serious laboratory-based and other testing, but without being tested on humans. The manufacturers are then obliged to monitor their use and to report back to regulators any apparent problems that may be coming to their notice. This is called “post-market surveillance”.The regime involves the making of “risk-benefit” estimations, says MacAleenan. With implanted devices especially, “there is always risk. The question is if it an acceptable level of risk.”Over recent years manufacturers and doctors have been reporting more than 800 adverse incidents a year to the HPRA. These are adverse medical events which would not be expected, ie a sudden failure of a device as against, for example, a patient who had a very severe cardiac condition dying of a heart attack. Many of the ensuing investigations have established either a definitive link with a medical device, or a conclusion that a device was probably or could have been a contributory factor to the adverse incident. No deaths have been definitively found to be directly attributable to a medical device over recent years, MacAleenan says.Frequently the response to such incidents is the taking of what is called a “field action”, which might be renewed or revised advice on the use of the device, or alterations to its nature.An interesting feature of the reports is that in between a fifth to a quarter of the incidents the device has not been retrieved from the person who suffered the adverse incident, and so it cannot be examined by the HPRA investigators.“Incident reports are not the be-all and end-all of what we do and are only part of the post-market surveillance,” says MacAleenan. The manufacturers are audited to ensure they are properly collecting information about their products and responding to any difficulties that may be emerging.The resolution of a lot of the problems identified is most often arrived at from dialogue between the manufacturer and the regulator, and often involves solutions suggested by the manufacturer.Medical devices are not like cars or other machines that can be withdrawn from the market without serious negative consequences if a problem is identified. Often the devices are providing crucial benefits to people who are in dire need of care, and the identified flaw feeds into a new risk-benefit analysis.“Medical technology has completely changed the treatment of so many different conditions,” says MacAleenan. “Many areas of medical care have been revolutionised.”The expectation is that the revolution is going to continue and that the medical device sector is set to involve a lot more connected technology, which will collect data from, and deliver instructions to, sophisticated medical devices. (The former US vice-president Dick Cheney had his heart device’s wireless capability switched off so it could not be hacked by terrorists anxious to kill him.)More and more devices are being managed by lay people and are being controlled outside hospital environments.The reformed EU regulatory regime for medical devices creates challenges for the sector and is likely to see an increased level of clinical screening, and increased amounts of information becoming available to the public, says MacAleenan.The challenges facing the regulatory system arise from the new improved regime, but also the changing nature of the technologies being produced by an innovative sector that shows no signs of slowing down.A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710106.1543171085!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar the alternative to this deal is a no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar discusses the outcome of the EU Council summit meeting in Brussels. “Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations.” Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe alternative to the withdrawal treaty between the EU and the UK formally signed off in Brussels on Sunday is “no-deal and a cliff-edge Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after the conclusion of the summit.“It’s going to become more and more obvious that the alternative to this deal is a no-deal scenario,” Mr Varadkar told reporters after EU leaders emerged from the EU Council meeting which approved the text of the withdrawal treaty.Echoing other EU leaders, Mr Varadkar said that the withdrawal treaty is the “only deal that’s on the table”.“I hear a lot of people talking about better deals and alternative deals. And anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds, but an agreement – 500 pages long, that 28 member states can sign up to – nobody has that,” he said.EU leaders were determined to convey the “this deal or no deal” message after a relatively perfunctory summit meeting which concluded after about two hours on Sunday morning, while British prime minister Theresa May also stressed that the current treaty was the best outcome that the UK could expect.Nevertheless, senior sources in both Brussels and the Irish Government acknowledged that the prospects of Ms May securing the acceptance of the British parliament for the treaty – at least on its first vote – were slim.Asked if he was ruling out any change to the exit mechanism from the backstop, which has emerged as a significant issue in London, Mr Varadkar replied: “I am, and it’s not just me, it’s the entire European Union today was very much of the view there couldn’t be a renegotiation.”Mr Varadkar said the “core difficulty” among those arguing for a better deal for the UK was that they “don’t agree among themselves” what a better deal could look like.“So really what’s being put before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations,” Mr Varadkar said.Mr Varadkar said that he understood the position of the DUP, which held its conference in Belfast on Saturday, but he would “posit a counterview”.He said that the deal agreed between the UK and the EU was “very much in line with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement”.He stressed everyone accepted Northern Ireland was and would remain part of the UK until such time as the people of Northern Ireland might vote otherwise, but that because of its “unique history and unique geography” it had special arrangements “that on occasion make it a little different from the rest of the UK”.Citing examples in agriculture, energy, corporation tax, human rights issues and “issues of personal liberty like marriage equality and a woman’s right to choose”, Mr Varadkar said that he didn’t think that “having a special arrangement relating to market regulations on industrial goods is fundamentally different from the special arrangements that exist already”.But, speaking at the DUP conference, MP Sammy Wilson accused the Government of “intransigence” and “not acting in good faith”.Mr Wilson told The  that once the economic implications of the proposed agreement being rejected by the UK parliament become clear, the EU and Irish Government “will be scurrying back wanting to get a deal done”.He argued that the Irish economy would be worst hit in a no-deal scenario where Irish beef, dairy and other agri-food exports to the UK would be hit with high World Trade Organisation tariffs.“We could get beef cheaper from Brazil than we could get from Ireland, so if Irish farmers want their government to ruin their agricultural economy, that is an issue which will have to be dealt with in the Irish Republic,” he said.Ian Paisley jnr, another DUP MP, said technical solutions, including trusted trader schemes and tax gatheringsharing arrangements, should be put “to the forefront of negotiations” to find an acceptable alternative to maintain an invisible border.“If I was the Irish Government, I would be trying to explain to my traders in the south of Ireland why they are not working so hard on a real trade deal,” he said.The DUP, which is keeping Ms May’s minority Conservative government in power at Westminster, is pushing for alternatives to the backstop in the legally binding Brexit treaty.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Arsenal back to winning ways Arsenal will give thanks that this weekend’s north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur is on a Sunday. Fourteen of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 18 Premier League goals have come on that day with his latest, a typical poacher’s finish, enough to defeat Bournemouth and lift Arsenal to within a point of the top four. Almost always on a Sunday, it seems, for Aubameyang.If Arsenal win at the Emirates, after a Europa League trip to Ukraine on Thursday, they will, deliciously for their fans, go above Spurs which would be astonishing given that Mauricio Pochettino’s side inflicted Chelsea’s first league defeat of the season on Saturday evening to claim third place.Unai Emery celebrates the winning goal against Bournemouth“A big moment,” Unai Emery said of this win and, at the Vitality Stadium, this was indeed a vital victory for Arsenal after three successive draws had threatened to stall early-season momentum under their new head coach.7. Hulkenberg trapped in ablaze Renault after crashNico Hulkenberg was involved in a spectacular crash on the opening lap of the final grand prix in Abu Dhabi but fortunately was finally able to walk away from the incident unscathed. Hulkenberg was trapped as his Renault caught on fire during the dramatic crash which saw the safety car deployed early on. The German\u0027s car somersaulted through the air one and a half times before landing the wrong way up after he made contact with the Haas of Romain Grosjean through the right-handed turn nine.Get me out, Hulkenberg yelled over the radio. There is fire. There is fire.The flames went out before track marshals hastily arrived on the scene. World champion Lewis Hamilton finished the season with a pole to flag victory.Read the full story. England head coach Eddie Jones has told Owen Farrell to carry on hitting hard despite being at the centre of another tackling controversy in the 37-18 victory against Australia. With England leading 13-10 just before halftime, fly half Farrell saved a certain try by halting Australian second row Izack Rodda just yards from England’s tryline.Eddie Jones, the England head coach, talks to his co-captain Owen Farrell Yet England’s co-captain, who was the last line of defence, conspicuously failed to use his arms in the tackle, which many observers felt should have led to a penalty try and a yellow card. Referee Jaco Peyper, however, just awarded a penalty and did not refer the matter to the Television Match Official, stating that Rodda had dipped his shoulder. Read the full story. Click here for more  videos.A Turkish female riot police officer reacts during clashes with women\u0026#39s rights activists as they try to march to Taksim Square to protest against gender violence in IstanbulPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Labour to reject deal and push for Article 50 extension because Theresa May has \u0026#39run down the clock\u0026#39 — live updatesEU court throws out WW2 veteran\u0026#39s Brexit challenge Mars InSight mission: What Nasa\u0026#39s trip to Red Planet aims to discover - and how to watch tonight\u0026#39s landingWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?Matthew Hedges jailed for spying in the UAE is pardoned \u0026#39with immediate effect\u0026#39 The broken pride of Dynasties: why are Kenya\u0026#39s lions being poisoned to death? Inside North Korea: can the North pull itself out of the past to reunify with the South?Comment: How on earth does university turn curious, feisty children into such fragile flowers?Comment: We should punish technology firms that fail to confront their own role in fuelling terrorismSocial media giants ‘risk lives’ by not helping police   \u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 stranding on remote New Zealand beach leaves 145 whales deadChinese scientist claims to have created \u0026#39world\u0026#39s first genetically edited babies\u0026#39Theresa May demands Brexit TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn as PM begins campaign to win Commons vote on dealComment: Fatally flawed Brexit deal is the worst possible outcomeBeware \u0026#39Cyber Monday\u0026#39 deals on must-have toys, police warn shoppersNHS saves record £300 million by switching to cheaper arthritis drugPensioners to face rising care costs due to 350,000 shortfall in care workers by 2028, IPPR warnsUS agents use tear gas on migrants at Mexico border as crossing closedSacked 88-year-old woman sues the NHS for age discriminationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2017/11/06/TELEMMGLPICT000001661614_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJweoRASOVpa8mWVoFXLzSsvk.jpeg?imwidth=450\" ","title":"earth does university turn curious feisty children fragile flowers","story":"For a generation who have grown up with the darkness and terror of Harry Potter, it is surprising they\u0026#39re so scared of ShakespeareAnother week, another report of the closing of young minds in the very place – university – where they should be most open.

Our six plus months of nightmare are finally over and to say we are elated is an understatement.That he is returning home to me and the rest of his family is much more than I was ever expecting to happen this week. I thank you all for your support.Without the involvement of the media, the overwhelming support of academics, the public worldwide, the work of the British diplomatic body in the UAE and Secretary Hunt\u0027s intervention, this would have never happened.I ask for some time to process the news and I will be making more statements in the coming days. Thank you all once again.The elated family are now scrambling for details to find out if they will be able to go and pick Mr Hedges up.Ms Tejada, who also tweeted a message of thanks on Monday, said the last time she saw her husband was when he was sentenced to life on Wednesday.She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: Sadly the last time I saw him we were both walking out of the courtroom, we weren\u0027t able to say goodbye. It won\u0027t be long until we can say hello.But at the same time of announcing his impending release, the Emirati government claimed to have a video which shows Mr Hedges admitting he was a member of MI6 and was looking into what military systems the UAE was buying. Ms Tejada rejected the UAE\u0027s claim that her husband was an MI6 agent, telling Today: In my heart I know that he isn\u0027t.Asked about the fact that he was being pardoned rather than the spying charges being quashed, she said: If that is what it takes for him to be back I just welcome the news.A spokesman for the UAE government stood by the claims Mr Hedges was a full-time secret service operative. The news comes after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had constructive talks with his United Arab Emirates counterpart over the weekend regarding the fate of the academic who was jailed for life last week.Diplomatic efforts to free Mr Hedges are being led by Mr Hunt amid an outcry after the 31-year-old was handed the life sentence, which carries a maximum term of 25 years.He too welcomed the news on Twitter, calling the development fantastic news, but said more needed to be done.The official Emirates News Agency said the customary pardon includes Mr Hedges as part almost 800 clemency orders issued to mark the UAE\u0027s 47th National Day anniversary.The agency quoted UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Anwar Gargash saying: His Highness the President\u0027s gracious clemency in the customary National Day pardons allows us to return our focus to the underlying fundamental strength of the UAEUK bi-lateral relationship and its importance to the international community.It was always a UAE hope that this matter would be resolved through the common channels of our longstanding partnership. This was a straightforward matter that became unnecessarily complex despite the UAE\u0027s best efforts.The case against Mr Hedges was predicated on evidence secured from Mr Hedges\u0027 electronic devices surveillance and intelligence gathering by UAE intelligence and security agencies and evidence provided by Mr Hedges himself - including a corroborated account of asset recruitment and training and the confidential information being targeted.His recruitment and progress within a foreign intelligence service was authenticated to the court by UAE intelligence agencies.The gracious Presidential customary National Day pardon allows us to close this chapter and to concentrate on the many positive aspects of the relationship.Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, an international civil and criminal justice organisation, said: While we are grateful for Matthew Hedges freedom, he should not have had to endure this in the first place and a country who is recognised by our British courts as torturing British citizens, should not be allowed to market and promote in the United Kingdom.The Durham University researcher\u0027s wife, Ms Tejada, initially claimed the British government was putting foreign relations above his liberty, but after meeting Mr Hunt on Thursday, was assured he was now standing up for her husband.In a statement at the UAE embassy in London on Friday, ambassador Sulaiman Almazroui made efforts to defend the judicial process, denying it was a five-minute show trial and claiming three judges evaluated compelling evidence over three hearings to make their ruling.He did not address whether the academic was given adequate legal representation throughout the process, which Ms Tejada has said he lacked.She swiftly rebuked the ambassador\u0027s defence, saying her husband had been held in solitary confinement for more than five months without charge or lawyer, and when he did receive consular access he was not able to talk openly.Mr Hedges, originally from Exeter, was arrested at Dubai Airport as he tried to leave the country on May 5.Professor Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said there is no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research.Emirati officials made a point to insist their arrest came on solid ground, showing a closed-door meeting of journalists hastily convened in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, short video clips of Hedges allegedly acknowledging his intelligence work.Jaber al-Lamki, an official with the UAE\u0027s National Media Council, said: He was a part-time PhD researcher, a part-time businessman, but he was a 100-percent a full-time secret service operative.Mr Hedges has been found guilty of espionage. He sought out sensitive information he knew had access to it. He was here to steal the UAE\u0027s sensitive national security secrets for his paymaster.In the video, Mr Hedges is allegedly seen describing himself as a captain in MI6 during what appears to be a court hearing somewhere in the Gulf Arab country.Another clip supposedly appears to show Mr Hedges speaking to someone in an office and saying: It helps the research to go in in an easy way.Then, Hedges is said to be seen snapping his fingers and adding: Then it becomes MI6.Emirati officials did not allow journalists to record the videos. In the office video, Hedges appears in a blue polo shirt and jeans, according to reports who were shown the clip. He did not appear to be injured or under duress, though the audio during the court appearance sounded garbled. Emirati officials also did not offer any context for the video clips.On Friday, the UAE\u0027s London ambassador defended the trial of British academic Matthew Hedges but said his government was studying a request for clemency made by his family. The Gulf state claimed to have compelling and powerful evidence against the British academic who was jailed for life for spying. An Emirati law chief said the case had been thoroughly investigated and warned the government does not attempt to interfere in court cases.But the UAE ambassador in London Sulaiman Almazroui made a short statement on the case on Friday morning, during which he said relations between him and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt were good, and he was studying a request clemency.He said: Matthew Hedges was not convicted after a five-minute show trial, as some have reported. Over the course of one month, three judges evaluated compelling evidence in three hearings.They reached their conclusions after a full and proper process. This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood and national security must be a top priority.Mr Hedges\u0027 family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had a good conversation yesterday with our foreign minister.He stressed the two nations\u0027 close ties, adding: Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.The wife of jailed academic Matthew Hedges said the Foreign Office ignored her weekly cries for help and has accused the Government of bowing to the UAE. Speaking on Thursday morning, Daniela Tejada said she still did not know where her husband was being held after he was jailed for life for spying on Wednesday following a five-minute hearing in front of an Emirati judge. After her first meeting with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, she said: I really appreciate the Foreign Secretary taking the time to meet me at this crucial point in Matt\u0027s life, she said, reading from a prepared statement after an hour inside the building.He has assured me that he and his team are doing everything in their power to get Matt free and return him home to me.This is not a fight I can win alone and I thank the Foreign Office and the British public for now standing up for one of their citizens.Talking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme before the meeting on Thursday, she said: I had been trying to persuade them to do more on a weekly basis. I asked for the Foreign Secretary\u0027s representation, firmer stances, and a more proactive approach. I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen\u0027s rightful freedom and his welfare. They were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance.She said the Foreign Office should have acted more strongly from the start, not after Mr Hedges, 31, a Durham University PhD student, had spent up to six months in solitary confinement.I believe that they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publicly then through their private representations. This is something I feel they failed to do throughout really, she said.They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn\u0027t part of their job, it wasn\u0027t part of their duty. On one occasion one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren\u0027t obliged to make such representations.Ms Tejada was given access to the courtroom on Wednesday, but Mr Hedges did not have a lawyer present and it was reported journalists had been banned from entering. When the judgment was handed down, meaning he could have to serve 25 years in prison, he started shaking. She said: He was very, very scared when he was standing in front of the judge because we knew of the possibility of an arbitrary judgment. I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous, which he tried to do a couple of times.  He started shaking when the translator told him the statement. He has to ask for him to to double check. I can imagine he\u0027s just as distraught as I am.Daniela Tejada arrives at Heathrow before her meeting with the Foreign SecretaryAfter arriving at Heathrow on Thursday morning, she told Today that they were separated by 10-20 metres during the sentencing hearing and that she does not know where he is being held.She is working with her husband\u0027s court-appointed lawyer, who she was only met once, to build a case for an appeal. Ms Tejada said all evidence against him is fabricated. The university supervisor of British academic Matthew Hedges has said there had been nothing clandestine about his research in the country.Professor Clive Jones of Durham University said Mr Hedges had been working on a thesis about civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring based on readily accepted literature.There was nothing clandestine or covert in any of the material he had been using up to date in the thesis, Prof Jones told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.He went to the United Arab Emirates to conduct a series of interviews to help flesh out some of the theories and some of the empirical evidence that he had actually collected.He added: If we had any inkling that Matt in any sense shape or form was going to be in danger, then of course we would not have agreed to let him go.Matt was no stranger to the United Arab Emirates. He had lived there on and off since the age of nine.He knew many of the people he was going out to interview so again it is utterly bizarre and indeed perverse and indeed a miscarriage of justice that this has befallen him.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Labour to reject deal and push for Article 50 extension because Theresa May has \u0026#39run down the clock\u0026#39 — live updatesEU court throws out WW2 veteran\u0026#39s Brexit challenge Mars InSight mission: What Nasa\u0026#39s trip to Red Planet aims to discover - and how to watch tonight\u0026#39s landingWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?The broken pride of Dynasties: why are Kenya\u0026#39s lions being poisoned to death? Inside North Korea: can the North pull itself out of the past to reunify with the South?Comment: How on earth does university turn curious, feisty children into such fragile flowers?Comment: We should punish technology firms that fail to confront their own role in fuelling terrorismThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend\u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 stranding on remote New Zealand beach leaves 145 whales deadSocial media giants ‘risk lives’ by not helping police   Chinese scientist claims to have created \u0026#39world\u0026#39s first genetically edited babies\u0026#39Theresa May demands Brexit TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn as PM begins campaign to win Commons vote on dealComment: Fatally flawed Brexit deal is the worst possible outcomeBeware \u0026#39Cyber Monday\u0026#39 deals on must-have toys, police warn shoppersPensioners to face rising care costs due to 350,000 shortfall in care workers by 2028, IPPR warnsNHS saves record £300 million by switching to cheaper arthritis drugUS agents use tear gas on migrants at Mexico border as crossing closedSacked 88-year-old woman sues the NHS for age discriminationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/26/TELEMMGLPICT000181905463_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXh8KVWGYOwoAu-Ckd7H129s.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"matthew hedges pardoned uae immediate effect","story":"Matthew Hedges, pictured kissing his wife Daniela Tejada, has been pardoned by the UAEMatthew Hedges, the British PhD student jailed for spying in the UAE, has been pardoned with immediate effect as part of the country\u0027s National Day clemency tradition. At a press conference in the Gulf state, an official said he would be free to leave the country once the formalities of the presidential pardon had been seen to. In a statement, Mr Hedges\u0027 wife Daniela Tejada, who has lobbied for his release, said she can\u0027t wait to have her husband back home. She said: The presidential pardon for Matt is the best news we could have received.

Emirati officials also did not offer any context for the video clips.On Friday, the UAE\u0027s London ambassador defended the trial of British academic Matthew Hedges but said his government was studying a request for clemency made by his family. The Gulf state claimed to have compelling and powerful evidence against the British academic who was jailed for life for spying. An Emirati law chief said the case had been thoroughly investigated and warned the government does not attempt to interfere in court cases.But the UAE ambassador in London Sulaiman Almazroui made a short statement on the case on Friday morning, during which he said relations between him and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt were good, and he was studying a request clemency.He said: Matthew Hedges was not convicted after a five-minute show trial, as some have reported. Over the course of one month, three judges evaluated compelling evidence in three hearings.They reached their conclusions after a full and proper process. This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood and national security must be a top priority.Mr Hedges\u0027 family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had a good conversation yesterday with our foreign minister.He stressed the two nations\u0027 close ties, adding: Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.The wife of jailed academic Matthew Hedges said the Foreign Office ignored her weekly cries for help and has accused the Government of bowing to the UAE. Speaking on Thursday morning, Daniela Tejada said she still did not know where her husband was being held after he was jailed for life for spying on Wednesday following a five-minute hearing in front of an Emirati judge. After her first meeting with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, she said: I really appreciate the Foreign Secretary taking the time to meet me at this crucial point in Matt\u0027s life, she said, reading from a prepared statement after an hour inside the building.He has assured me that he and his team are doing everything in their power to get Matt free and return him home to me.This is not a fight I can win alone and I thank the Foreign Office and the British public for now standing up for one of their citizens.Talking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme before the meeting on Thursday, she said: I had been trying to persuade them to do more on a weekly basis. I asked for the Foreign Secretary\u0027s representation, firmer stances, and a more proactive approach. I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen\u0027s rightful freedom and his welfare. They were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance.She said the Foreign Office should have acted more strongly from the start, not after Mr Hedges, 31, a Durham University PhD student, had spent up to six months in solitary confinement.I believe that they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publicly then through their private representations. This is something I feel they failed to do throughout really, she said.They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn\u0027t part of their job, it wasn\u0027t part of their duty. On one occasion one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren\u0027t obliged to make such representations.Ms Tejada was given access to the courtroom on Wednesday, but Mr Hedges did not have a lawyer present and it was reported journalists had been banned from entering. When the judgment was handed down, meaning he could have to serve 25 years in prison, he started shaking. She said: He was very, very scared when he was standing in front of the judge because we knew of the possibility of an arbitrary judgment. I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous, which he tried to do a couple of times.  He started shaking when the translator told him the statement. He has to ask for him to to double check. I can imagine he\u0027s just as distraught as I am.Daniela Tejada arrives at Heathrow before her meeting with the Foreign SecretaryAfter arriving at Heathrow on Thursday morning, she told Today that they were separated by 10-20 metres during the sentencing hearing and that she does not know where he is being held.She is working with her husband\u0027s court-appointed lawyer, who she was only met once, to build a case for an appeal. Ms Tejada said all evidence against him is fabricated. The university supervisor of British academic Matthew Hedges has said there had been nothing clandestine about his research in the country.Professor Clive Jones of Durham University said Mr Hedges had been working on a thesis about civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring based on readily accepted literature.There was nothing clandestine or covert in any of the material he had been using up to date in the thesis, Prof Jones told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.He went to the United Arab Emirates to conduct a series of interviews to help flesh out some of the theories and some of the empirical evidence that he had actually collected.He added: If we had any inkling that Matt in any sense shape or form was going to be in danger, then of course we would not have agreed to let him go.Matt was no stranger to the United Arab Emirates. He had lived there on and off since the age of nine.He knew many of the people he was going out to interview so again it is utterly bizarre and indeed perverse and indeed a miscarriage of justice that this has befallen him.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Labour to reject deal and push for Article 50 extension because Theresa May has \u0026#39run down the clock\u0026#39 — live updatesEU court throws out WW2 veteran\u0026#39s Brexit challenge Mars InSight mission: What Nasa\u0026#39s trip to Red Planet aims to discover -

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe plummeting price of bitcoin in recent days has led to some cryptocurrency analysts joking that bitcoin has gone on sale, just in time for Black Friday.Bitcoin has fallen in price by around $2,000 over the last week, marking the latest losses in a turbulent year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.Bitcoin price just hit new 2018 low as analysts predict reversalNigel Green, founder and CEO of financial services firm deVere Goup, recently said the recent price crash has created a buyers’ market.“Savvy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money and, as such, they will be capitalising on the lower prices in order to build their portfolios and shore-up their positions,” Mr Green said.“Prices might fall further over the next few days, but we can expect a long-term upward trajectory for the crypto sector.”Some bitcoin exchanges are even offering bitcoin giveaways in an effort to entice people to their platforms.“Our mission is to make buying bitcoin quick and easy for everyone,” CoinCorner co-founder Danny Scott wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent. “We are delighted to provide new cryptocurrency users with a fantastic offer that will give them a great first experience into the world of bitcoin.”Bitcoin payment processor BitPay, which has seen huge payment spikes on its network on Black Friday in previous years, has even gone so far as to release a song for this year’s event.Set to the tune of Rebecca Black’s ‘Friday’, lyrics include: “They don’t take cryptocurrency, they should take cryptocurrency, excuse me sir, what currency will you take?”The chorus concludes: “Everyone’s adopting bitcoin, don’t be a weirdo... They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And the economic thinking he’s doing is certainly “new”. Downright heretical, many would say.So what’s led him to this radical conclusion that we should stop obsessing about productivity growth? The answer is twofold.First, he suspects automation is happening quicker than is being picked up by our official GDP statistics. Second, he thinks lots of the new service jobs being created as the mechanisable parts of the economy become\u0026nbspmore efficient are inherently “zero sum”, meaning they are competing for the distribution of wealth rather than its creation.He gives an example of street sweepers and lawyers: “If we manage to create a totally effective automated street sweeping machine nobody would have a job as a street sweeper….But if we apply IT to the limit to law, there’ll still be lawyers. It’s just that each of these two highly paid lawyers will now have software that review not simply many cases, but every single case that there’s ever been”.“What do lawyers do? They fight against each other. If you make lawyer A and lawyer B both much more skilled than they were before you can’t say there’ll be a better product, there’ll just be a more intense fight.”He thinks that focusing on productivity growth in this context will not help to deliver a higher quality of living for most people. Indeed, he fears it could actually end up harming living standards, citing the example of those who provide social care for the frail elderly.“What do we do with those jobs at the moment? We reduce their status and their cost. We put them up for competitive bidding. And we bid down the price. And then we do these gig economy games where people being paid to do social care of the elderly aren’t even employed for movement between client one and client two we say you’re only working when you’re at the client. Then we tailorise their life. We say ‘you’ve got 14 minutes to clean someone’s bottom’…”The solution, Turner says, banging the desk of his Mayfair office where we are meeting\u0026nbspfor emphasis, is simply to stop focusing on the bottom line.“We’ve just got to pay more for social care – we’ve just got to make something which is valued. We’ve got to pay higher taxes to afford it. They’re never going to be high-paid jobs, but we should not be using the techniques of the market to skinny them down.”He concedes the macroeconomics of his argument, laid out in an extensive lecture in the US earlier this year,\u0026nbspis unproven. There are certainly many theoretical and empirical challenges that could be mounted. He also accepts that his thesis that we should focus more on distributing the GDP pie than growing the (measured size of it) will not be easily swallowed by the policymaking classes.Turner advises a start-up online bank – OakNorth – which he says has influenced his views on the rapid underlying speed of job-shedding automation.As chair of a group called Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) group, made up of public and private sector experts and executives, he’s also advising governments in China and India on decarbonisation.Despite Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris Accords, Turner insists he’s relatively hopefully about the prospects of cracking the problem of a rapidly overheating planet.“We’re optimistic that there are bits of Indian policy that are heading in the right direction. I’m optimistic that China gets it, that they are determined eventually to bring down their emissions, that they’ll develop renewables on a massive scale, that they’ll electrify their bus fleets etc,” he says.“The thing that frustrates me about climate change is that we could get to 2060 and we could have a pretty close to zero carbon economy. Run the numbers and it’s completely doable by technologies that we know how to do. It is soluble if we just get on with it.”But what’s lacking from Turner’s employment portfolio is a major, high-profile, public sector job in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour seems an obvious fit. They could use someone with Turner’s economic and establishment credentials.And it turns out there has been some contact. On 19 May (the same day as the Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding) Turner was to be found addressing Labour’s macroeconomic conference.Chair, Institute for New Economic Thinking since 2015But could he work with a party who many in the business world regard as unreconstructed Marxists, a bigger threat to the economy even than Brexit?“The answer is I’d have to spend a bit more time,” he says, judiciously. “There are some things about some of the people around them of which I am suspicious. There seem to be some people around then who genuinely do believe that Venezuela is a well-run country. You cannot believe that and be sensible. Venezuela is a disaster and it has been destroyed by a left-wing Marxist government that had oodles of oil revenues. You’ve got to say the way that the world is.”But he’s certainly not shutting the door.“There are things that make me wary of that tradition on the left which can see no problems with left-wing governments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The pound fell 0.19 per cent to €1.1284 off the back of reports that Italy is headed for a breakthrough with its budget, which would bring to an end weeks of wrangling between the EU and the Italian government. However, the UK currency rose 0.17 per cent against the dollar, to hit $1.2836, after EU leaders signed off on Theresa May’s Brexit deal over the weekend. May prepares to give statement on Brexit deal- liveEU leaders approve Theresa May’s Brexit but say it cannot be changedThe EU\u0027s austerity bias is to blame for the budget standoff with ItalyItaly\u0027s budget crisis is a bigger threat to the EU than BrexitConnor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “muted nature” of sterling at the open is “likely because Theresa May’s Brussels success comes laden with some potentially deal-sinking domestic caveats, namely the House of Commons’ ‘meaningful vote’ expected to be held on 12 December”.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agreed that markets are likely to stay sensitive to any Brexit news in the coming weeks.“The fact that EU leaders have agreed the UK’s exit deal ultimately isn’t enough to convince the market that Brexit will be conducted smoothly,” he said. “Getting the deal approved by parliament is the real hard task, so UK equities are likely to remain volatile until the vote in mid-December.”Meanwhile, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said sterling traders “know very well that the real struggle is just about to begin”. “There’s a lot of bad news that is currently priced in sterling, but more to come if the deal is voted down by parliament, so expect risk to remain skewed to the downside,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Using a variety of instruments, it will delve into the inside of the Mars surface, burying underneath.Elon Musk renames \u0027BFR\u0027 rocket to \u0027Starship\u0027As it does, it will send back information about what the planet looks like underneath that famous, dusty red surface. Scientists hope to learn about not only Mars itself but also about other rocky planets in our own solar system – including Earth.The rover will land on the surface on Monday evening, UK time. Nasa will livestream the proceedings, and they will be covered as they happen here on\u0026nbspThe Independent.That descent is not guaranteed, and comes amid concern and upset about the future of the Opportunity rover. There have been numerous failed missions to Mars: from the European Space Agency\u0027s\u0026nbspSchiaparelli\u0026nbsplander, which smashed into the surface in 2016 at such speed it could not have survived, all the way back to the original Soviet missions in the 1970s which repeatedly failed.This time around, we\u0027ll get to know if it\u0027s successful straight away. That\u0027s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The moment in question madeher look incapable of reading aloud and saw co-presenter\u0026nbspTess\u0026nbspDaly silently stunned as the floor manager (presumably) fainted. \u0026nbspUp until then, the most shocking moment of the night was one of this series’s favourites – former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts – only finishing third on the leaderboard.Here are the episode\u0027s five biggest talking points.There were many sniggers about how our seven remaining couples might crash into each other when they all took to the floor simultaneously to lindyhop the audience into submission. But in the end, it was the judges who provided the carnage. When the music stopped,\u0026nbspBallas was asked to read out who came 7th. After a technical error meant her digital read out was unavailable, she reached for a scrap of paper and duly read out who had come first. Then she got the names of the professional dancers wrong. And was left to tie herself in knots before Claudia Winklemen eventually diffused the tension with a couple of one-liners. Seann\u0026nbspand Katya will be furious they now have competition for the most awkward moment of the series.Faye and Giovanni’s dream waltzAshley and Pasha remain the only couple to receive a perfect 40 (translation: the only ones that\u0026nbspCraig Revel-Horwood has given a ten), but Faye\u0026nbspTozer and her partner, Giovanni, got really close tonight. They were nervous after abandoning their American Smooth to save Gio’s bad back mid-week, \u0026nbspin favour of a waltz mid-week. But you couldn’t tell: it was a dreamy, graceful routine met with a shower of judges’ compliments. They finished top of the leaderboard and surely booked their place in next week’s quarter final.Stacey and Kevin’s fierce pasoStacey Dooley loved her Blackpool salsa so much she didn’t wash her hair for a week to preserve the memories. Watch her interview on Friday’s It Takes Two if you don’t believe me. After initially panicking about the ‘Paso Dooley’, she really attacked this number and Kevin choreographed an incredible routine to atmospheric, authentic music. After waiting all series for a ten they got three. See you in the final, Stace.Created with Sketch.

Two tens seemed rather generous, but then again Strictly are always looking to encourage younger viewers to stay watching the show…Lauren’s out of her depthAfter hoping last week’s low-scoring Argentine Tango was a one-off, Lauren Steadman was gutted to get underwhelming feedback for her salsa tonight. Public support saves her every week, however vulnerable her spot on the leaderboard, but she’s struggling to keep up with the competition now. Will her fans save her again? Pool enthusiasts certainly won’t be impressed after she and her partner, AJ, wrecked a perfectly good table by jumping on it.So, who will go? This is a very different question from who ‘should’ go? While Lauren was by far the weakest dancer, dance-off regulars Graeme and Charles both find themselves on the bottom half of the leaderboard. One of them is bound to run out of luck tomorrow night….Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That was insensitive and ignorant. A deeply felt apology to all.”In the original post, the Aladdin writer was comparing using the word to using the phrase “anti-vax”.He wrote the message in reply to Julie Benson, a writer on TV series The 100, who was calling for her users to contribute to vaccination efforts.Johnny Depp ‘dropped’ from Pirates of the CaribbeanHe replied: “My heart goes out to all the parents of vaccine damaged children, who have to not only endure the sadness of their loss, but also the vitriol of ill-informed and insensitive people (such as those here). Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a n****r and makes as little sense.” \u0026nbspAfter Benson replied asking Rossio to “...please never come on my feed with the N-word again,” Rossio replied: “Do you realise that you are using the equivalent of the ‘N-word’ in promoting memes that tag people as ‘anti-vax?’ Do you realize that the same collectivist stereotyping lies behind belittling any group with a label? Do you have no feelings for vaccine damaged kids and parents?“Twitter users immediately criticised Rossio for using the word, and said the comparison he made was shameful.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Elias Lopez, a three-year-old Honduran migrant, plays in between the shields of a line of Mexican riot police, when the group he was part of tried to cross the Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.

Elton John and Tim Rice, who won a Best Song Oscar for their original track Can You Feel the Love Tonight as part of their work on the original film, recently confirmed they have made a new end credits song for the remake.Some doubt has been expressed on social media by fans of the original film. Some have complained about the film being billed as a “live action” version rather than CGI. And while the casting generated considerable excitement, a viral video showing a shot-by-shot comparison of the new film’s opening with the original has prompted some fans to question whether anything different or new has been added.However, the majority reaction still appears to be largely positive, with much of the excitement focused on the all-star voice cast, and the obvious quality of the CGI in the film. \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The only deal possible.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”Outside the summit, pro-Remain activists took a blowtorch to a mock copy of the withdrawal agreement, before they were asked to stop by Belgian police.EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May’s Brexit dealEU leaders agree to back Theresa May’s Brexit dealTop ministers ‘plotting different Brexit’ if deal fails in CommonsTheresa May writes ‘letter to nation’ insisting Brexit agreement worksHigh Court to rule if Brexit vote ‘void’ amid Banks investigationSpeaking on the doorstep of the meeting, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he did not expect MPs to reject the deal.“I don’t expect a ‘no’ vote. I expect a ‘yes’ vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more,” he said.Discussion about what to do in the event the deal was rejected was notable by its absence from the meeting, with one senior EU official saying there was “no appetite” for it after the gruelling slog to an agreement.“I don’t think there were any ‘what if’ questions asked to Theresa May today, quite a few were wishing her good luck,” they said.We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possibleIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: “We made the conscious decision as 27 not to speculate\u0026nbspon alternative scenarios.“We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possible.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “It is important that everyone in the UK is aware of the fact that this agreement is the final result. It will definitely not be renegotiated and there will be no further leeway.”The European Council conclusions released after the meeting specifically thanked chief negotiator Michel Barnier “for his tireless efforts as the Union’s chief negotiator and for his contribution to maintaining the unity among EU27 member states throughout the negotiations”.\u0026nbspEU leaders met among\u0026nbspthemselves without Theresa May, and were then joined by the British prime minister to discuss the deal once they had signed it off. The PM has been in Brussels since Saturday afternoon putting the finishing touches to the deal.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The UK conceded in writing that Spain should have a veto over whether any future trade deal applies to Gibraltar – potentially storing up trouble down the road. Spain wants any future relationship governing the British overseas territory to be negotiated bilaterally between itself and the UK.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels were delighted with the result, particularly the maintenance of EU unity in the face of British attempts to ide the bloc.“Many member states have had very particular concerns which are all legitimate, and there has been a willingness to accommodate,” one EU source said.“More fundamentally that says something about the nature of the union. The union stands up for its member states – like Spain, Ireland. This is the essence of the union. I would tend to borrow a slogan and say ‘Stronger In’.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I accept that no deal is something that is going to have to involve the whole EU but I think there would be a very strong push by the majority in Parliament against no deal.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think this Prime Minister would simply plough on regardless, as she knows how dangerous no deal is.\u0026nbspEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Junker has insisted the deal reach on Monday between the UK and the EU is the “best deal for Britain” and “the only possible deal”.\u0026nbspHe told Radio 4’s Today programme that if the House of Commons rejects the deal when asked to vote in the coming weeks, “we would have no deal”.\u0026nbspHe added: It\u0027s not the intention of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, nor of the Parliament, to go for a second referendum. This is the deal.\u0026nbspAsked if the Brexit negotiation was a punishment process for the UK, Mr Juncker said: I don\u0027t understand why the British people, and I like the British people for so many including historical reasons, why they are feeling that they are humiliated.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t see that because numerous points of view of the British have been taken into this deal. So, this is not a humiliation for Britain.Stephen Barclay - the new Brexit secretary - has admitted it will be a challenge to get May\u0027s deal through parliament as scores of MPs say they will vote against it.But he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today the PM\u0026nbsphas got the best agreement possible for the UK\u0026nbspafter her negotiations with Brussels.Asked about how the government will get the deal secured by Ms May at yesterday\u0027s summit approved by the House of Commons, Mr Barclay said: Well it\u0027s going to be a challenging vote.But it\u0027s now the job of all of us in Cabinet to make the case to our colleagues, to make the case to the country.The Prime Minister, after two years working day and night in the national interest, has secured a deal that respects the referendum result. And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She tweeted on\u0026nbspSaturday: “I’d be up for a full leaders debate on the ‘deal’.”Ms May is due to face the Commons again now that her plan has won EU approval, and is expected to tell parliamentary colleagues: “Our duty as a parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.“There is a choice which MPs will have to make. We can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people.“Or this house can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one.”Created with Sketch.

I believe our national interest is clear, she will tell MPs. \u0026ldquoThe British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country whichever way we voted.                EU has secret plan to extend Article 50 amid fears over May\u0027s deal                Police forced to stop anti-Brexit protester sets fire to Brexit dealHer remarks come ahead of the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal that was endorsed by EU leaders at a summit in Brussels yesterday.Downing Street sources have told the  the historic vote will be held on December 12 following five full days of Commons debate.In a statement reporting on yesterday\u0027s summit, the Prime Minister will tell MPs today: Our duty - as a Parliament over these coming weeks - is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.\u0026ldquoThere is a choice which MPs will have to make.\u0026ldquoWe can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people.\u0026ldquoOr this House can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one.It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail.British Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: Sean GallupGetty Images)Mrs May will warn that the EU has given the UK a take-it-or-leave without a deal offer, saying: I can say to the House with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available.She will add: I believe our national interest is clear.\u0026ldquoThe British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country whichever way we voted.\u0026ldquoThis is that deal. A deal that delivers for the British people.Leaders of the 27 nations remaining in the EU after Britain leaves took just 38 minutes to rubber stamp the draft Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU at a special summit in Brussels.At the gathering called to conclude 18 months of Brexit negotiations, a string of leaders said Parliament had to accept the deal on the table as no better alternative would be offered.                Labour\u0027s secret talks with People\u0026rsquos Vote backing SECOND REFERENDUM                Brexit news: May will revive THIS EU offer if Parliament rejects dealPresident of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker  (Image: Sean GallupGetty Images)European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: This is the deal. It\u0027s the best deal possible and the EU will not change its fundamental position when it comes to these issues, he said.Those who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte added: This is the deal on the table. I don\u0027t think there is anything more now.Mrs May yesterday acknowledged she faced a massive challenge to persuade MPs to back her deal in the run up to the vote. Five days of intense and rancorous Commons debates are expected in the run up to the crucial ision.It will be one of the most significant votes that Parliament has held for many years, the Prime Minister said at a news conference at the end of the Brussels summit yesterday.On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty, she said.I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country.Mrs May yesterday acknowledged she faced a massive challenge to persuade MPs to back her deal (Image: )In Parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart and I look forward to that campaign.She added: The British people don\u0027t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit.They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country.Mrs May refused to be drawn on whether she would stand down if she lost the vote, despite being repeatedly pressed during her end of summit press conference.I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs, she said.Mrs May also admitted she did not share the sadness expressed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the UK\u0027s exit from the EU.Asked if she felt sad, the Prime Minister said: No, but I recognise that others do. I recognise some European leaders are sad at this moment.But also some people back home in the UK are sad at this moment.Mrs May refused to be drawn on whether she would stand down if she lost the vote (Image: PHILIPPE LOPEZAFPGetty Images)The way Iook at it is that it\u0027s for us now to move on to the next stage.I\u0027m full of optimism about the future of our country. I believe that we can with this good deal with the EU we will remain friends and neighbours.We are leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe. We will continue to have that good, close partnership and relationship with countries within the EU.During her press conference, Mrs May said: I believe there should not be that second referendum, we gave the choice to the British people, they voted, they voted to leave the EU, I think we should now deliver on that.She added: They\u0027d (the public) expect Parliament to vote on the deal as it is presented.Asked if she would stand down if the deal is voted down in the Commons, she replied: I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs and I think the point that Jean-Claude Juncker was making, that\u0027s been reiterated by others was that if people think somehow there\u0027s another negotiation to be done that\u0027s not the case.This is a deal that\u0027s the result of what has been tough and difficult negotiations over a significant period of time and as has been said this is the deal that\u0027s on the table, this is the best possible deal, it\u0027s the only possible deal.By yesterday, more than 90 Tory MPs had publicly threatened to vote against Mrs May\u0027s deal.Former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who Downing Street aides had hoped to win over, yesterday said it would be very, very difficult to support the Prime Minister\u0027s deal arguing far too much has been given to the EU.He told Sky News\u0027s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: Well I don\u0027t want to stay in the EU. I campaigned and voted to leave the EU. I don\u0027t believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for, take back control of your borders, your laws, your money. I think it has ceded too much control.In another blow to the Prime Minister, former Tory leader Lord Howard also joined the ranks of those opposing her deal yesterday.It\u0027s not a deal I can support.It\u0027s not a deal that is a good deal for the UK in several respects, but the one sticking point that I have relates to the arrangements for leaving the backstop, he said.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersAs members of the European Union we had a unilateral, untrammelled right to leave under Article 50 which we are exercising.Under the backstop arrangements we could only leave with the permission of the European Union.That seems to me to be an absolute negation of taking control, that would put us in a worse position than we are now.And a senior Labour MP yesterday dampened the hopes of Tory whips that a significant number of opposition MPs in Leave-voting regions of the country could be won over to back the deal.Backbencher Lisa Nandy said: There\u0027s been no attempt to reach out to Labour MPs like me.It\u0027s just too big a gamble for MPs like me to take with our constituents\u0027 futures.Asked if she would be supporting the deal, she said: Well I\u0027d hoped that it would be, but in all honesty no it\u0027s not and it\u0027s inconceivable now that when this comes before Parliament in just a few days\u0026rsquo time that I\u0027ll be voting for it. I won\u0027t be voting to support the Withdrawal Agreement.

We have an agreement that took between 18 months and two years to negotiate, it is in several parts, is over 500 pages long and as of today has the support of 28 governments.Anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds, but an agreement 500 pages long that 28 member states can sign up to, nobody has that.What\u0027s on the table is the only deal that\u0027s on the table.2.30pm update: Brexit deal is \u0026lsquonext best\u0026rsquo option - VaradkarIreland\u0027s premier said the best outcome for all concerned would be if the UK remained in the EU, but given that was not going to happen the draft agreement was the next best option.Leo Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoI\u0027ve always thought the best outcome for Ireland and for Europe and indeed the United Kingdom would be for the UK to stay in the European Union, the customs union and the single market, but we respect the decision of the British people and the UK parliament not to do that.What we have agreed today is the next best outcome. It protects the peace, affirms the rights and freedoms of European, Irish and British citizens, ensures there will be no hard border and also insulates our economy from major disruptions in trade.He added: What we need to do now is to get on with it and get on with the ratification of this agreement by the House of Commons and also by the European Parliament and when that\u0027s done, from March, April onwards, to get busy negotiating the future relationship treaty.2.06pm update: Spain hints at new bid for Gibraltar sovereigntySpain has signalled it is preparing a fresh push over the sovereignty of Gibraltar as the Brexit talks enter a new phase of negotiations.Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez claimed the Withdrawal Agreement, signed off by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday, represented a win for his country in the 300-year-old dispute over the Rock.He told an end-of-summit press conference: With the departure of the UK we all lose, especially the UK. But in relation to Gibraltar, Spain wins, and Europe wins.Mr Sanchez had earlier threatened to scupper the special summit to approve the deal unless he received fresh assurances on the status of the Rock in the forthcoming talks on a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.The Spanish leader was pressing for Madrid to have a veto over how any UK-EU trade deal applies to Gibraltar.In an effort to resolve the row, the UK\u0027s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow issued a letter on Saturday confirming the Withdrawal Agreement imposed no obligations regarding the territorial scope of future agreements.Theresa May again insisted that it made no difference to constitutional status of the Rock.1.00pm update: \u0026lsquoWorst of all worlds\u0026rsquo Corbyn confirms Labour will oppose Brexit deal.Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed Labour will vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit deal when MP\u0026rsquos have their say in the House of Commons.The Labour leader said: This is a bad deal for the country.It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. It gives us less say over our future, and puts jobs and living standards at risk.That is why Labour will oppose this deal in Parliament. We will work with others to block a no-deal outcome, and ensure that Labour\u0027s alternative plan for a sensible deal to bring the country together is on the table.That includes a permanent customs union with a UK say, a strong single-market deal and guarantees on workers\u0027 rights, consumer and environmental protections.Theresa May\u0027s Government has started a Twitter campaign to #BackTheBrexitDeal (Image: )12.30pm update: PM confident the UK has achieved the \u0026ldquobest dealTheresa May confident we have achieved the best deal for the UK as the EU endorsed the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relationship.The Prime Minister said the deal delivered for the British people and set the UK on course for a prosperous future.Mrs May also echoed comments made by the EU that this was the \u0026ldquoonly deal possible.Addressing the media at a press conference in Brussels Mrs May said she will back her deal with all my heart as she faces an uphill battle to convince MP\u0026rsquos to vote for her Brexit, which she confirmed will be before Christmas.The Prime Minister said: It will be one of the most significant votes that Parliament has held for many years. On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty.The British people don\u0027t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit.They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country.I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country.In Parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart and I look forward to that campaign.Mrs May also ruled out a second referendum and refused to comment on her position if parliament rejected her deal.She added: \u0026ldquoI believe there should not be that second referendum, we gave the choice to the British people, they voted, they voted to leave the EU, I think we should now deliver on that.Asked if she would stand down if the deal is voted down in the Commons, she replied: I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs and I think the point that Jean-Claude Juncker was making, that\u0027s been reiterated by others was that if people think somehow there\u0027s another negotiation to be done that\u0027s not the case.May said she was not sad about Brexit as the UK and EU would remain friends and neighbours.Asked whether she shared Angela Merkel\u0027s sadness at Brexit, Mrs May said: No, but I recognise that others do.I recognise some European leaders are sad at this moment, but also some people back at home in the UK will be sad at this moment.12.10pm update: Brexit deal strenghtens Spain\u0026rsquos position over GibraltarSpanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez says the withdrawal agreement and political declaration agreed between the EU and the UK will strengthen his country\u0027s position with Gibraltar.Mr Sanchez said: This puts Spain in a position of strength in negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar that we have not had until now.12.05pm update: Theresa May press conference\u0026nbspimminentThe Prime Minister to address the media shortly in Brussels\u0026nbsp11.55am update: UK to \u0026lsquoremain friends until the end of days\u0026rsquo with EUEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said during the press conference: Ahead of us is the difficult process of ratification as well as further negotiations.But regardless of how it will all end, one thing is certain: we will remain friends until the end of days.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450259066-e1542730861899.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"true story the innocent man","story":"The scene of the  sex slaying was beyond horric: Debbie had been violated with a ketchup bottle and her crazed killer had scrawled messages all over her body and the walls of her flat using tomato sauce and nail polish.For five years the police failed to garner enough evidence to convict anyone of the murder.Then, in , Ronald Keith Williamson – already in prison for forging bank cheques - was blamed for the horric crime and sentenced to die.But all was not as it seemed.Williamson protested that he didnt do it, and it took  excruciating years on death row before he was eventually exonerated and released.The nightmare crime made for a story which has so many twists and turns that it became the subject of a book by John Grisham, and has now been made into a Netflix series, The Innocent Man, airing on  December.Here, Sun Online takes a closer look at the true story behind the upcoming show.Ron Williamson was born in  in Ada, Oklahoma - the same town as murdered Debbie Carter.He was a natural athlete and excelled at sports, but his primary interest was baseball.After enjoying some early professional success - even playing with the New York Yankees - Williamson’s dream of baseball greatness ended with a shoulder injury that saw himto his hometown at the age of , his career in tatters.No longer a local hero, Williamson was dogged by failure and fell into a deep depression, living at his mother’s house and sleeping up to  hours a day.He was soon diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he was never given proper treatment and self-medicated with drugs and alcohol.The downward spiral continued until his le finally hit an even more desperate low in  - on a night when Debbie Carter worked her sht as a waitress at Coachlight, a bar which Williamson frequently went to.After the murder was discovered, police interviewed Glen Gore, another customer at the Coachlight that evening, and he claimed he had seen Williamson arguing with Carter that evening.The police were also told that murdered Debbie Carter had revealed to a friend that Williamson, “made her nervous”.Police quickly identied Williamson as a suspect, along with his friend Dennis Fritz. Neither were able to provide an alibi for the evening, as they couldn’t remember where they’d been.Williamson agreed to take two polygraph tests, both of which came up as “inconclusive”.Without any physical evidence, a confession, or solid circumstantial evidence, Williamson was released and the case went cold for five years until Williamson ended up in Pontotoc County Jail in Ada, awaiting trial for forged cheques.There, an inmate named Terri Holland claimed the usually reserved and quiet Williamson confessed to her he’d murdered Debbie Carter.Police exhumed the body of Debbie Carter in May of  and arrested Williamson’s friend Fritz who also happened to be caught – on tape – confessing the murder to a cellmate.Hairs found at the scene were then analysed by the forensic chemist lab in Oklahoma City and were found to match both suspects and they were charged with the murder.Williamson, at this point, was still in a dire mental state.He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia in addition to his prior battles with bipolar disorder and depression.“Untreated, unmedicated, Ron was charged with capital murder,” Grisham said in , hinting at the gross injustice of the case.Denied access to medication by prison guards, Williamson became, “a wild man” at the trial.Scared and exasperated, he started shouting and screaming his innocence at the judge and jury.But his pleas didnt help his case the jury convicted him of murder and the judge sentenced him to die.Appeals were fruitless.It was only after Williamson had spent  years on death row in Oklahoma, and with only five days until his scheduled execution, on September , , that the judge issued a stay that made it possible for Williamson to be exonerated and take his le back.With the help of a new legal team, Williamson was moved to a treatment area for mental patients, where doctors finally concluded he was completely unstable.His new team of lawyers argued that Mr. Williamson had not been competent to stand trial and his lawyer had not effectively challenged the hair evidence or sought other suspects.In , Williamson underwent DNA testing that proved his innocence beyond a doubt and on April , , he and Fritz were completely cleared of all guilt.DNA evidence, meanwhile, matched Glenn Glore – the main eyewitness for the State at Williamson’s trial who helped to convict him – as the true murderer.Fritz and Williamson filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Pontotoc County district attorney and other defendants — including the city of Ada, the state of Oklahoma, Gore, and county police officers — of engineering “a  case that consisted of faulty forensic evidence.They also said this included fictitious confessions reported by jailhouse snitches with overwhelming motives to lie, in addition to the self-serving lies of the actual murderer.”Williamson and Fritz settled the suit and both men received an undisclosed sum of money.The spring after their release, Williamson and Fritz visited New York, where they took a tour of Yankee Stadium.Williamson said at that time that he was just getting a taste of how much fun they were having up here.”Sadly, just five years later, on December , , Williamson died in an Oklahoma nursing home, surrounded by his family after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.He was  - and had spent over a fth of his entire le behind bars, waiting to be killed, for a crime he didnt commit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when an American ­missionary called John Chau, pictured, heard about how the ancient tribesman on the remote North Sentinel Island between India and Burma were notoriously hostile to outsiders, he decided he must pay them a visit.He knew, of course, that the th Century explorer Marco Polo had described them as cannibals.He also knew that when a rescue helicopter ­hovered overhead after the  tsunami, they threw spears at it.But he was doing God’s work. It was important work. To convert the heathen.So off he set with hope in his heart and a song in his lungs.He paid fishermen to take him as close as they dared to the island and then he did the last bit of the journey in a canoe.Eventually, he reached the beach where he was promptly hit by an avalanche of arrows. Which killed him.And the incident can’t be investigated becausea policeman lands there, he will immediately be eaten.NO one knows how the Starship Enterprise works. Or why the crew doesn’t fall over when it suddenly goes into warp drive – not even Zoe Saldana .It’s always been billed as ­science fiction. But now two boffins in America have turned it into science fact. They’ve built a plane that has no moving parts, inset. It uses electronic trickery, nitrogen and ordinary air to get thrust from what’s known as an “ionic wind”.And it works. It actually flew for  metres before it crashed into a wall.That doesn’t sound like much.But let’s not forget that the Wright brothers only ­managed  metres on their first flight. And  years later, we were going through the sound barrier.THIS deal that’s been thrashed out between Mrs May and all the European leaders.Does it mean,and when it’s done, that we will be in the EU or not So far, I can’t find a single person who actually knows.BAD news from Italy. After some crafty engineering work in the s, the leaning tower of Pisa is starting to straighten up.Tourism chiefs must be praying however that it never becomes properly straight, because Pisa without that bendy tower would be like Barry Manilow without the nose.I’VE always vehemently opposed the death penalty. With two exceptions.People who drop litter and people who block yellow boxes at junctions.They should be ­executed, on the spot. By sniper fire.It turns out, however, that only two cities in ­Britain enforce yellow box laws with one, London, saying that they are ­handing out £ fines as fast as the postman can run. Almost  people a DAY are being fined at one junction alone.Offenders say they can’t help it and that poor traffic light sequencing is to blame. Hmmm. Well let’s impose my death penalty idea and seethey’re quite so willing to flout the law then.WE were always told the HS high-speed rail link would be worth it, as it could cut the journey time between London and the North West by as much as  or  seconds.But now, engineers are saying that trains will not be able to go through the tunnels as quickly as they’d hoped.So actually, ­Manchester United fans ­wanting to travel from where they live, in ­London, to Old ­Trafford may in fact be better off using a horse.MANY people ran into the street screaming this week when it was revealed that one of ­Britain’s top bosses was paid £million in the last financial year.And what’s more, it turns out that the boss in question, Denise Coates, pictured, from the gaming ­company Bet, was paid £million the year before. That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

But the future Duke and Duchess of Sussex were unhappy when told her first choice was impossible, as no one knew exactly where it came from.An insider said: There was a very heated exchange that prompted the Queen to speak to Harry. She said, ‘Meghan cannot have whatever she wants. She gets what tiara she’s given by me’.A source said that Kate and Wills set-up wouldnt suit the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have fewer obligations than the future king.The Cambridges have their garden in the back, which is nice, but there is no real other space for children to play in, the source said.Frogmore, which is inside the Windsor security zone [where the main house is only open to the public for a couple of days a year] is secluded, peaceful, tranquil and, most importantly, private. No one will see them coming or going.The Sussexes are currently living in Nottingham College in the Palace, where Kate and Wills lived before the move to their -bedroom home on the same site.But the newlyweds are unlikely to want for much in their new home, which is currently undergoing a multi-million pound refit paid for by the taxpayer.The couple are familiar with the cottage, having enjoyed their evening wedding reception at neighbouring Frogmore House.The cottage will provide ten bedrooms and a nursery for their baby, due in April, with the couple expected to move in next year.For centuries, the Grade II-listed house has been a popular royal hideaway and is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements.The name was inspired by the large number of frogs that thrive in the low-lying, marshy Berkshire countryside that surrounds it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450835784-e1543187745144.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chippy cant find staff darlington","story":"For unemployment among youngsters aged  to  stands at seven per cent in their home town of Darlington, Co Durham, and the business is offering flexible shts, lts home from work and free grub.Workers, say the Suhadolniks, “become part of the family”.

I was at home looking after my daughter and I had to ring my mum and ask her to go into work.“She’s  and had been working at lunchtime in the other shop.”Frank’s forthright letter said: “Perhaps Universal Credit cuts have not yet been severe enough to make many recipients keen to work.“We have been employing people for nearly  years and have never encountered as many workshy ­people as we do now.”Darlington brought in ­Universal Credit in June — around the time the chippy started hiring — and claimants need to be actively seeking work to get the benefit.The family believe it is why they get so many CVs but so few takers for jobs. Robert says that potential workers have been put off by reductions in their benefitsthey work too many hours.As the fryers were fired up, ­Robert outlined what is needed to work behind a chippy counter.He said: “Being personable is the most important skill.We’re stood face-to-face with people, cooking their food. People want a chat. There’s also a skill to the frying.”He’s not wrong. With a greasy sheen of beef dripping clinging to my clothes, I lowered my first fillet towards the ­simmering fat — then let go too early.The resulting splash sent a spray of fat globules on to my forearms.One of Robert’s workers, a mum in her s who didn’t want to be named, said: “You do need a good shower after a sht.”But she added: “I’ve worked here for  years and absolutely love it. The customers become friends.”Soon our first customers arrived and the chippy’s hiring crisis was a hot topic of conversation.Quantity surveyor Graham Todd, , said the construction industry is also plagued by no-shows, adding: “The way I was brought up meant you had to put the work in and then you’ll get the reward.A lot of people just want the reward now.”Next in was retired prison officer Paul Wood, , who said: “Some people don’t want to work these days. They are workshy, they think they’re better off on benefits.”Customer services worker Scott Martin, , said: “Teenagers today do seem a bit privileged.Would they look at a job in a chippy and think, ‘This looks like hard work’  Yes. I think workshy is the word.”But certainly not all of them.His daughter Jessica, , has asked about a part-time job there and said: “I love the smell of fish ­cooking, I like working with food. It would be a good starter job.”Judging from my experience, she’ll enjoy her time there.Now it’s just four more staff to hire for the job they don’t want . . .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took just  minutes for the PMs Brexit plan to be agreed by the EU in Brussels yesterday, but getting it past MPs back home will be a far tougher task. By last night,  Tory rebels and the DUPs  MPs had warned they would vote against the compromise proposals, which critics say leaves Britain bound to European rules with no say over them. But the Prime Minister staked her future on the pact as she refused to rule out resigning - or the government collapsing –it is defeated. And the desperate PM today embarks on a two-week campaign that will pit her own MPs against the British public - by warning they have a “duty” to back her deal “in the national interest”. MPs want Mrs May to reopen talks with Brusselsit is voted down. But EU chiefs declared her pact the “only deal possible” with “no plan B”. And Mrs May will tell the Commons today: “I can say with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. “There is a choice MPs will have to make. We can back this deal... or go back to square one. It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty.” Among those bidding to block the deal is Brexiteer John Hayes, recently given a knighthood by Mrs May in what many saw as a bribe to win his backing.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded her fudged plans a miserable failure that his party would vote against. His colleague Lisa Nandy said it was inconceivable she would back the deal. DUP leader Arlene Foster insisted there were no circumstances in which her  MPs will back the deal - and said she will review her poundbillion pact propping up the Toriesit goes through.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt underlined Mrs Mays high-stakes gamble by warning there is a fear the Government could collapsethe deal is rejected in a Commons vote between December  and . He said: Its not possible to rule out anything.  Former PM Tony Blair insisted the deal was as dead as a dodo and urged EU leaders to come up with a fresh plan. But Brussels bosses declared Mrs Mays pact was the only one possible after she held talks with European Council chief Donald Tusk and others. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: If the House [of Commons] say no, we would have no deal. Dutch PM Mark Rutte added: There is no Plan B. If anyone thinks by voting No something better would come out of it, they are wrong. Lithuanias PM Dalia Grybauskait said there are at least four possible scenarios which may include afor the vote of the people. As the threat of no deal loomed, reports emerged that a gang of five Cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond are prepared to quitthe PM tries to leave without a pact. The Chancellor is said to have joined Amber Rudd, David Lidington, Greg Clark and David Gauke, plus the DUP, in discussing a Plan B or mass resignationsthe deal is defeated. Reports claimed it involves the Norway option of staying in the European Economic Area - which would contradict the PMs pledge to end free movement. A source close to the Chancellor branded the reports fake news but DUP leader Arlene Foster did not deny them. She said: Were talking to everybody across government.   Mrs May remained embroiled in a row with Tories over her capitulation on Gibraltar. In a bid to get Spain to sign off on the deal, she agreed the Rock may not be part of a future trade pact. MP Nadine Dorries said: Shes abandoned Northern Ireland, now Gibraltar. Its beyond words how bad this is. Mrs May insisted policy had not changed – and was backed by a senior EU diplomat, who said Spains behaviour was outrageous” and other nations were irritated. The diplomat told the Mirror: “I hope they havent made it more dficult for May in Parliament. She has it dficult enough already. If that tips it over the balance, that will be very unfortunate. French president Emmanuel Macron hit back after Mrs May said her deal sets us free of the Common Fisheries Policy for good. He revealed he will seek access to British waters for French fishermen as part of trade talks - or threaten to keep the UK trapped in EU customs rules indefinitely. Mr Macron said: All our fishermen will be protected. And the EU yesterday agreed a fishing deal, by December , must build on existing reciprocal access and quota shares.

The Prime Minister is frantically trying to sell her deal and sees a primetime Sunday night debate as a way to persuade the public. Jeremy would relish a head-to-head debate with Theresa May about her botched Brexit deal and the future of the country, a Labour spokesman said. If agreed the show could happen on Sunday  December - days before the crucial Commons vote. The debate would form part of the PMs national offensive with speeches planned on dferent aspects of the deal in all four nations of the country in the coming days.  The reports come despite chicken Mrs May ducking calls for TV debates during last years general election. At the time she dismissed the value of TV debates sayingI don’t think people get much out of seeing politicians having a go at each other and said Mr Corbyn ought to be paying a little more attention to thinking about Brexit negotiations. But the Prime Minister is now relying on winning over the public in a bid to convince wavering MPs to back her. On Monday afternoon she will tell a hostile House of Commons with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. The Prime Minister, who will chair a meeting of her Cabinet on Monday morning, will warn rejecting her deal will open the door to more ision and uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail. At a historic summit in Brussels on Sunday, the leaders of the remaining  member states took less than  minutes to approve the deal.  Following the announcement European Commission president insisted that the deal was the UKs only option. On Monday morning Jean Claude-Juncker insisted again that there will be no more negotiation. He told BBC Radio s Today programme: This is the only deal possible. So,the Housesays no, we would have no deal. Mrs May will now put it to a vote of MPs before Christmas but faces a battle to get it through the House of Commons in the face of intense opposition on both the Leave and Remain-supporting wings of her party.  She has already started a campaign of selling her deal directly to the public in the hope their support can win round MPs opposed to the plan before the Commons vote, expected in the week beginning December . In her Commons statement the Prime Minister will say: Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.  There is a choice which MPs will have to make. We can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people. Or this House can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one ... It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail. She will say that the national interest is clear and the British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson branded the Prime Ministers deal a disaster and a humiliation for the UK. In his regular Dailycolumn, he said: The other EU countries have signed the deal immediately, because they know that they have us exactly where they want us.  We are a satellite state - a memento mori fixed on the walls of Brussels as a ghastly gaping warning to all who try to escape. More than  Tories have rejected the deal, with opposition parties - and Mrs Mays allies in the DUP - also set to oppose it.  Writing in the Daily , deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds demanded the Government go back to the negotiating table rather than waste any more time putting forward  choices. We are heading under this deal for Brexit in name only or the break-up of the United Kingdom, he warned. The tragedy is that it is all so utterly unnecessary. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Mrs May could carry on as Prime Ministershe was defeated. Absolutely she can, he told BBCs The Andrew Marr Show. Pressed on whether the Government could collapse, he acknowledged: Its not possible to rule out anything. Mr Corbyn said the deal is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. At a press conference in Brussels, Mrs May refused to be drawn on whether she would stand downshe lost the vote, despite being repeatedly pressed on the subject. I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs, she said.

The Lib Dem leader said: “This is a million miles from what the Brexiteers promised two years ago and will create decades of uncertainty.” On Sunday two cabinet ministers failed to say whether or not the UK would be better off under Theresa Mays Brexit deal or staying in the EU. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt damned it with faint praise saying it “mitigates most of the negative impacts” of leaving the EU. He added: I think we will not be signicantly worse off or better off, but what it does mean is that we get our independence back, our sovereignty back.

But that does not mean her work is done. The Prime Minister is now trying to win support at home for a vote by MPs, but faces an uphill struggle. There are already  MPs who plan to vote against the proposal -  Tory rebels and the  DUP MPs she normally relies on for support So where have we got to and what happens next  What has been agreed The Brexit deal was agreed by EU leaders in  minutes yesterday at a special summit in Brussels.There are two parts to the package: the withdrawal agreement which sets out the terms of the orce and the political declaration, which is the route map for the UK and EUs future trade and security relationship. This deal now has to be agreed by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament before we leave on March  next year. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves.Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstopEuropean courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. When will parliament vote on the final Brexit deal  Theresa May has a frantic two weeks in which to sell her deal to MPs and the public. The Commons is expected to vote on the withdrawal agreement during the week beginning Monday, December .The PM says this is the only deal on offer and it is a choice between her plans, no deal or no Brexit at all.Why is the deal so unpopular  Conservative Leave MPs say the withdrawal agreement leaves us bound by EU rules and regulations with no say over them. Many Tory Remain MPs, such as Jo Johnson, share this concern. Brexiteers are most exercised by the Irish backstop which promises no hard border between Northern Ireland and Irish Republic. This says that,no other solution can be found, then Northern Ireland will remain within the orbit of the EU. The DUP says the Irish backstop would result in a border down the Irish Sea - effectively splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - and are also refusing to back the deal. What does Labour say about the Brexit deal  Jeremy Corbyn says the agreement fails to meet its six tests. These are a deal that provides the exact same benefits of the single market and the customs union, a strong and collaborative relationship with the EU, protects workers rights and environmental standards, a fair system of migration, protects national security and delivers for the nations and regions of the EU. While Mrs Mays deal fulfils some of these demands it does not give access to the single market and the customs union, while the section on workers rights is time-limited. Labour says it would renegotiate a better outcome. The question isthe EU, which says Mays deal is the only one on the table, would be willing. As for former PM Tony Blair, he insisted the deal was as dead as a dodo and urged EU leaders to come up with a fresh plan. Can Theresa May get her Brexit deal through Parliament   At the moment it is hard to see where the numbers are. The vast majority of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Lib Dems will vote against as well the  DUP MPs. So far as many as  Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Government. Downing Street is now in a race against time to get as many MPs as possible to change their mind. Mrs May is trying to appeal over Parliaments head by appealing to the public that her deal is in the national interest in the hope voters will put pressure on their MPs. Butthis tactic fails she could be forced to look at rewriting the withdrawal agreement or adding some last-minute caveats. What happensparliament votes against the Brexit deal  We are in uncharted territory. The PM,she survives, could submit the agreement to a second vote of MPs. Another option is the Commons votes to send Mrs May back to the negotiating table. But, with time running out, this would require extending Article , which in turn needs the approval of all  EU states. There could be another general election but Tories will not want to risk any move that could allow Jeremy Corbyn into No . Another possibility is MPs decide to send the issue back to the people by holding a second referendum. Or we crash out without a deal.

A spokesman for Warranty Wise, who conducted the research, said: This data is derived from real cases and genuine warranty claims making it the most trustworthy information a used car buyer can get. “We are not suggesting, by any means, that these problems are guaranteed to occur, but it is the sole reason a warranty exists.” The most reliable brand is the Honda with a % reliability rating - while Seat is the least reliable with %.

The most expensive common problem with the car is gearbox faults which on average cost pound to repair. . Fiat  The Fiat  is another very common car on UK roads, but is very prone to gearbox problems. The Italian car also suffers with problems arising from the suspension, electrical faults and also clutch faults.   Problems start to arise with car when it is close to eight years old. . Seat Ibiza The Spanish manufacturer is popular with motorists - but Warranty Wise say most common problem is with the engine and will cost motorists a huge pound.    Other common faults with the car include issues with the ignition coil, turbo faults and gearbox faults which all cost more than pound to repair. Normally problems start to pile up on Ibiza drivers when the car is nine years and three months old. . Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper is one of the UKs most iconic cars due to its association with the classic film The Italian Job - but they have a number of issues which do not come with mini repair costs. The most common problem with the Mini Cooper is a clutch fault which typically sets motorists back approximately pound.   But costly issues such gearbox or engine failures will set motorists back on average a whopping pound. To compound the woe, it normally takes just one-and-a-half years for the problems to pile up. . Mercedes-Benz C-class A Merc is an expensive car to buy, so unsurprisingly it isn’t a cheap car either to fix. The most common fault with the car is an electrical fault which costs on average pound to fix.   Other common problems include sensor faults, suspension faults, engine faults and problems with the alternator. But it does normally take close to a decade for the issues to surface. . Vauxhall Astra Despite being Vauxhalls second best selling model behind the Corsa in the UK - some of the most common faults will set you back a small fortune to repair. The most common warranty claim is for gearbox issues - which cost more than pound, to fix.   Another major problem with car is with engine faults normally costing around pound to repair - alongside electrical and clutch faults. It normally takes nine years and three months for problems to pile up. . Peugeot  French manufacturer Peugeot has a reputation for unreliability. The most common fault with the car includes engine problems, faults with cylinder head gasket, clutch faults, electrical faults and gearbox faults.   The priciest problem with Peugot is engine faults which on average cost owners pound. But it normally takes  years and two months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Insignia This is Vauxhall’s second entry to the list, a popular saloon car with families. Warranty Wise state the biggest problem with the vehicle comes down problems with the steering.   This usually costs around pound to repair but other common faults include engine faults and gearbox faults which typically cost more than pound, to fix. It normally takes seven years and seven months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Zafira Vauxhall makes yet another entry into the list - and the Zafira has been the subject of ious recalls due to fire fears that have been caused in the main by replacement parts. But the most common fault with the car is down to problems with the gearbox which on averages costs more than pound, to repair.   More common issues include clutch faults, problems with ignition coil, alternator and ious electrical faults. It normally takes  years and three months for the problems to develop. . Range Rover Sport A Range Rover Sport does not come cheap, so its unsurprising that the cars most common faults are expensive to fix. Warranty Wise claims the most common fault with the car is its suspension, which on average costs around pound to repair.   More common faults include problems with the alternator, brake faults, electrical faults and EGR Valve faults - and it usually takes around nine years for these problems to build up. For those reasons, it is one of the most unreliable cars on the market.

Excited families queued for up to two hours for Boltons Weekend after they had been promised an ice-skating rink, Christmas stalls, a Santas Grotto, a snow globe and an appearance from Disney characters. But, though kids under  were allowed in for free, adults paid pound on the door or pound in advance to find a filthy grotto and stalls which resembled a jumble sale.The ice rink was actually plastic tiles on which a member of staff sprayed soapy water, Manchester Evening News says.And the snow globe was branded dangerous after it collapsed with children inside.   Claire Cassidy, , went on Saturday with her two-year-old son, two friends and their two children. The angry mother said: There was no Christmas atmosphere, no trees, no music. The advert showed a big ice rink and it turned out to be just plastic tiles and a guy putting down soap. It was filthy. The snow globe was deflated each time kids went in, parents were saying it was dangerous. It was crammed - it was an hour queuing for the globe and about two hours queuing for Santas Grotto.   People who had paid in advance said they were told they wouldnt have to queue. It was a very disappointing experience. Other fuming parents ranted on social media. Sarah Halliday tweeted the photos of the plastic ice rink and deflated snow globe, adding: the most overhyped mis-sold event Ive ever had the displeasure of attending. Another visitor tweeted: We went to Bolton Winter Wonderland yesterday and it was a complete joke! Inside was like a jumble sale and the ice skating was a disgrace and nothing like advertised! I want to claim my money back Jeff Chadburn wrote on Facebook: Did anyone see the magical winter lane highlighted on the map    Felt more Christmassy on my walk around BM bargains. Bar the grotto, which we didnt see, theres nothing in the theme of Christmas or winter at all! On the approach over the bridge you see the struggle of parents with prams evacuating the overly loud fun fair after realising they too had been deceived into thinking this was a child friendly festive day! This event does not live up to the title winter wonderland at all, car boot sale at best. Several people also claimed that a large number of negative reviews had been deleted from the Winter Weekends official Facebook page and that they have not been given a response when asking for refunds. When the Manchester Evening News rang the landline number on the Winter Weekend page, it was out of service.   Organisers have not yet replied to further requests for comment, but event manager Martin Robinson spoke to the Bolton News on Saturday. He acknowledged there had been issues with queuing adding: We had a lot more people turn up than we expected. We have moved the grotto and snow globe around to make queuing easier and get more people through in a better way. This event is fantastic for Bolton. The organisers have tried to bring the local community and businesses together. The response at the event has actually been really positive. Most of the people that went away yesterday were happy.

JP, a mobile phone sales adviser from Altrincham, Gtr Manchester, said: “The past five weeks have been a rollercoaster. After being in a waiting game for so long everything has happened so quickly.  “It has been an emotional time. It is happiness more than anything.

It was during a chance conversation with one of his customers that he found out about the transplant work being done at Leeds General. He had a year of physical and psychological assessments before being put on the waiting list in January. In September he got a call that a donor was available. And two weeks later he left hospital with his new limb. He said: “It has changed my le already in a few weeks because you see a dference in the way people look at you. “Now I’m just a man with his arm in a sling.

Thirteen per cent of those surveyed said they had seen a general increase in the number of children swearing in nurseries. Sue Learner, of daynurseries, which conducted the poll, said: “Swearing seems to have become more socially acceptable and young children... can hear it in pop songs or on YouTube. “However, despite it becoming more prevalent in society, it is still shocking and incongruous to hear profanities coming from the lips of a young child.” Childcare expert John Warren, said: “Rather than introducing children to a world of beautul language we’re introducing them to a language, well, that is sh**. “And this language is... also quite happily used on giant billboards for children to view, such as the ‘B*****ks to Brexit’ campaign. We need to bring back the innocence in children’s lives.”  “Let them have fun with language and invent new words.” “And this language is not reserved for less affluent families it is also quite happily used on giant billboards for children to view such as the ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ campaign. “We need to bring back the innocence in children’s lives, awe and wonder, the tooth fairy, Father Christmas, unicorns and fairies. “Let them have fun with language, invent new words and don’t be so quick to jump on the child who says ‘poo, fart and bum’ and then giggles.”  He added that it was condescending to say the parents need to be educated, but that parents need to be supported with tools and advice to use new vocabulary. However, not all nursery staff believe children should be taught not to swear, but rather that they should be instructed that nursery is not the right place for it. Cheryl Hadland, managing director of Tops Day Nurseries, said: “I would agree that we are hearing more children swearing in a day nursery, and that it is generally more acceptable in society. “However, we are also preparing young children for school and for learning that there are dferent rules in dferent locations, so learning to refrain from swearing at day nursery ‘because we don’t use that word here’ is acceptable in my opinion.” "},{"url":null,"title":"face prime ministers spencer percevals","story":"NewsFace of Prime Minister Spencer Percevals killer revealed  years onAssassin John Bellingham was \"atomised\" for his crime in  but that hasnt stopped forensics experts from being able to recreate his faceShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsJohn Bellingham shot dead PM Spencer Perceval in the lobby of the Palace of Westminster in May  \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the face of the only person to assassinate a British Prime Minister – recreated using his skull and digital technology.

John McMullan, , said he was shocked by the scores in a recent PIP assessment for his son Declan, , who is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Claiming he faced ignorant questioning, he said he feared what other disabled people might face during their assessments for the benefit, which is replacing Disability Living Allowance. Belfast Live reports that are neurological condition that means he is unable to control his movements despite being fully aware. He requires -hour care for the condition, which was triggered when his brain was starved from oxygen during an eight-minute cardiac arrest when he was .When John recently received a letter informing him Declan must be reassessed for the new payment, he expected the change would be made without question. He explained: The form was very easy to fill in because Declan cant do anything other than blink. He is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Doctors told us to imagine being buried alive - that is what Locked-in syndrome is. But three weeks later, I received a phone call from an assessor to ask questions. John claimed the assessor, who wanted to see Declan face-to-face, displayed a total ignorance of his condition. He said: In my opinion, I supplied ample evidence of Declans disability but I doubt they actually understood what is on that paper. I dont think the people assessing are fit to be doing it. Declan achieved the full payment but John said he was shocked to see that he did not achieve full points for his daily living needs. He said: Declan cannot eat and is PEG fed yet the assessor only gave him  points out of  for the level of assistance he needs with eating and drinking. He cannot move at all, only blink, yet the assessor gave him just two out of eight points on whether he needs supervision or assistance managing his therapies. He got   for needing assistance making budgeting decisions and just   for needing support in social situations.If a GP is telling the government somebody is sick, who is an assessor to question the doctors judgement  How can a PIP assessor be properly qualied to override those doctors  Declans team include occupational therapists, social workers, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and psychiatrists. A PIP assessor cant be all of that. I knew Declan was never going to be turned down for PIP. It was just the stupidity of the process and the fact even he did not get full points. Declan is probably one of the most disabled people in Northern Ireland. How disabled do you have to be  John said he was convinced the assessors aimed to get as many people off disability benefit as possible and believed a bonus system made them sales people in reverse. Recalling the year and a half Declan spent in hospital following his cardiac arrest, John said they were devastated to be told he was in a borderline vegetative state.But the family was delighted to realise he could communicate by blinking. One of the first things Declan told his parents was that he wanted to go home. John recalled: That is when our battles began. We had to fight to have the house sorted out for him and we had to take out a bank loan to buy an accessible vehicle as DLA was not available while he was in hospital. I had to fight for a generator to ensure Declan did not die during an electricity outage. And now PIP. How many times do severely disabled people need to be assessed  If professional people are providing professional evidence is that not good enough  When you are disabled, you dont need to prove you are this disabled. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Department expects the highest standards from Capita, who deliver the PIP Assessment Service and they have to conform to a rigorous set of quality standards set down by the Department. Each disability assessor must have a minimum of two years post registration experience which must be fulfilled within an approved health profession and receive extensive training in line with DfC guidelines before they undertake PIP assessments. “Capita is committed to delivering a high quality and empathetic service for people applying for PIP. Its disability assessors are healthcare professionals with the required skills and knowledge to carry out PIP assessments across Northern Ireland. The PIP assessment looks at how iniduals are able to complete a number of key everyday activities. Within each activity there are a number of descriptors, each representing a ying level of ability to carry out the activity. Iniduals receive a point score for each activity, depending on how well they can carry them out and the help they need to do so which is based on the evidence provided and collected. The guidance which disability assessors and PIP case managers are expected to apply is set out in the PIP Assessment Guide. “A robust complaint process is in place for customers who are unhappy with the service provided by Capita which includes the opportunity to escalate a complaint to the Departmentthey feel it has not been satisfactorily resolved. “The terms and conditions of the contracts of employment for Disability Assessors are a matter for Capita and are not set by the Department. However, the Department understands that an annual quality incentive of pound, is wholly based on the Disability Assessor producing consistent high-quality reports on a timely basis and is not related in any way to decisions on entitlement to PIP. “Decisions on iniduals’ entitlement to PIP are made by the Department.

Twisted Richard Dowling made -year-old Daniel have sex with him and the young boys stepmother during three years of sickening abuse. The father claimed he abused his son “to try and steer him in the right direction and not to go to the way of being gay, because there was like, sort of, tendencies for him to be gay”. Daniel was also made to watch porn and when he refused to perform a sex act on his stepmum his dad tried to punch him. Dowling told Reading Crown Court: “All I ever wanted was for him to turn out the right way.”  Daniel was robbed of a normal childhood – replaced by a sordid existence which right-minded people will find hard to fathom. He has been haunted by his ordeal – even by the smell of his stepmum’s perfume – for more than  years. But now he has now seen his tormentors jailed after turning detective to prove the guilt of his father, an ex-Ministry of Defence worker. Warped Dowling was jailed for five years and his ex-partner Annette Breakspear got eight. They are  now but were  when the abuse began. Legal reasons prevented them being identied before today. But they can finally be exposed after Daniel, , bravely waived his anonymity.   He told the Sunday Mirror: “It was Dad’s job to protect me. They stole my innocence and ruined my childhood. I can never get past that.” Daniel will never forget the day the abuse began. It was a Sunday afternoon. Dowling and Breakspear were playing board game Frustration with Daniel at home in Bracknell, Berks. Fashion retail manager Daniel, who now lives in Surrey, recalls: “Dad told me we were going to try something dferent – to take our clothes off whenever someone lost. By the end of the game Annette was completely naked. “They instructed me to touch and kiss her breasts. Dad was encouraging me to do it so I thought it was okay. I think that night was a tester of how I’d react because intercourse started after that.” Daniel’s father had met former carer Breakspear through a lonely hearts ad after splitting from the lad’s mother. During three years together Breakspear stole Daniel’s virginity and abused him more than  times.   Once, he was picked up by his dad from Scouts, taken home and told to “give Breakspear a goodnight kiss”. Daniel said: “I went into their room and she was handcuffed to the bed naked. “I gave her a kiss and went to leave but she asked me to touch her and to untie one of her hands. We had intercourse and Dad came and joined in.” Another time, he was made to view porn before his dad had oral sex with Annette and said: “That’s how you do it.” In another sickening incident Daniel was called in to find them naked and engaged in a sex act. Breakspear then had sex with Daniel. He said: “We’d watch porn in bed together and then we’d have threesomes. She’d instruct me on what to do. Sometimes when Dad wasn’t there she’d ask me into her room for fondling and intercourse. “I was an only child and I spent a lot of time playing Lego but she’d come in and ask me to do things to her.”   Daniel, who is gay but currently single, said: “I was sexualised at such a young age that sex means nothing to me now. “The few positive memories of my childhood are tarnished by memories of the abuse. When I smell someone wearing her perfume, or see that board game in a shop or on TV, it brings the memories back.” Daniel added: “Dad said that he did it to stop me being gay because I showed feminine traits as a child. “One day we were at a car boot sale and my neighbour saw me wrestling an old lady for a handbag. “She told my dad, ‘Your Dan’s going to bat for the other side’. And Dad said ‘No son of mine will be gay.’ I think the abuse started after that.”   It only stopped when Dowling and Breakspear split up around . He claimed he broke up with her because she told him she’d had sex with Daniel and his grandad on the same day. The teenager and his father moved to Weymouth, Dorset. But Daniel, then , was targeted by another paedophile. Police raided the pervert’s home and found naked pictures of Daniel. It was then, as he was being interviewed by a child psychologist, that Daniel revealed the years of abuse from his dad and stepmum. Dowling was quizzed but claimed his son was an “attention seeking” liar. Daniel believes Breakspear was not questioned and there were no arrests. The despairing youngster later tried to kill himself. When the case finally came to trial in May this year it was claimed police treated him “shoddily” at his  video interview – and that one constable even mocked him. Daniel says it was left to him, some  years later, to finally get justice. On September , , he secretly recorded a phone conversation in which his father admitted the abuse. Two days later Daniel walked into Staines police station, Surrey, with the recording – and he said that this time the police took him seriously. He said: “I don’t knowtraining has improved orI was just unlucky the first time, but I would definitely encourage other victims of historic abuse to come forward and report it now.” Daniel’s dad admitted to police that he and Breakspear carried out “sordid and deplorable” abuse and that he felt ashamed and disgusted.   In court he claimed the abuse was to prevent Daniel “turning gay”, to “protect him from paedophiles so he would know what was right and wrong” – and to educate him about how he should treat women. He blamed his actions on “undiagnosed depression” and said he fell under the influence of Breakspear – who he labelled “a Jekyll and Hyde character”. Breakspear was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault. Dowling admitted one count of cruelty to a child and two counts relating to sexual offences involving a child. He was found not guilty of one count of indecent assault. Judge Maria Lamb told Dowling: “Your warped sense of right and wrong allowed him to be exploited by your then partner not just once but again and again. You’ve failed to protect him from the sexually predatory behaviour of your co-defendant. “The damage is incalculable. The abuse of trust is monstrous and the reality is that one of you was involved in active sexual abuse and the other connived at it.” The judge told Breakspear: “For your own perverted sexual gratication you initiated this boy into a world far beyond anything to which he should ever have had to be introduced at those tender years.” Daniel, who has not spoken to his father for over two years, said: “Dad threw me under the bus instead of admit his guilt. He is dead to me now.” Det Supt Fiona Grant, of Dorset Police, responded to criticism over the  video interview. Praising Daniel for his courage, she said: “The video met all necessary guidelines and was accepted as evidence during the trial at Reading. “We conducted multi-agency professionals meetings with regards to his ongoing safeguarding. “Dorset Police takes sexual assault extremely seriously.

Steph Sykes, , swapped being a couch potato and gorging on , calories a day - more than twice the daily limit - for healthy eating and exercise - and is now a size . The administrative assistant teamed up with her mum on a joint diet amid fears that st lb Steph would suffer a terrible fate. Mum Karen Sykes, , persuaded her to join a slimming class with her - where her daughter lost a staggering st lb. Steph has told how she feels like a completely dferent person and almost cant believe her new look when she gazes into the mirror.   The young woman, from Billingham, County Durham, said: “I’m st lb, wearing a size  now and I feel so dferent. “When I was a size , I could only get my clothes from one place online and I’d only leave the house to go to my mums, where Id also lie on the sofa. “Now, when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me. While admitting that she was always very overweight, Steph said her relationship with food became really toxic after her beloved dad, Alan Sykes, , died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge which can burst open, or rupture, and lead to bleeding inside the body - on Father’s Day in .   Left completely heartbroken, she recalled: “I was on holiday in Spain with my ex and had sent dad a message that morning, thanking him for how much he had done for me over the years and called him the best dad ever. “But that night, around pm, I got the biggest shock when my mum called saying hed died. It was such a shock and I felt broken. “I was always big. My mum was large and so was my dad, and all I’d really known myself as was a size . “Dads death was when I really started eating on my feelings, though, and my weight became out of control.”  Not working then and eating all the time, Steph barely left the house she shared with her now ex. She only left her bedroom to go to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for more food - stuffing down calorie-laden treats like crisps, biscuits, sweets and takeaways like pizza, curries and ready meals. Steph said: “I became a hermit. I was bored and unhappy and didn’t care what I looked like any more. “Le didn’t really feel worth living to me, so I thought, ‘Who cares that I’m so big ’  “My boyfriend didn’t seem to mind that I was letting myself get so large, so I kept eating and eating, only really going from my bed, to the kitchen to the sofa and the bathroom, apart from once a week, when I went to mums house, five minutes away, where I’d just lie on the sofa, too.” But, her sedentary lestyle - sleeping until pm, then gorging in front of Netflix - became a real concern to her mum, who also works as an administrative assistant. Desperate to help, Karen joined a local Slimming World class in April last year, hoping Steph might follow. Her gamble paid off when, impressed by her mums weight loss and surprised by the meals she could still eat on the programme, Steph joined her for her first class a month later.  Finally sticking to a diet plan and eating proper meals, she began having a yoghurt and two brunch bars for breakfast, salad for lunch and pasta with a fresh sauce for dinner - meaning her excess weight started falling off. By the following October, Steph, who was newly single, had already lost three stone. Now,  months after she first joined Slimming World, Steph is unrecognisable, after losing almost st. She said: “I feel like a completely dferent person.  “I can actually buy clothes in high street shops now and when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me.” But her tremendous weight loss has left her with a legacy from her fat years, in the form of a stone of unsightly excess skin around her body, which she is now desperate to shed. Steph said: “Through my hard work and determination I know I have achieved so much in my weight loss, but now I want to feel as amazing as I know I deserve to. “It’s everywhere, on my tummy, under my arms, my legs, my back.  “I’ve done all the hard work, but now I need to get rid of this skin to feel my transformation is complete.” But an abdominoplasty, or tummy-tuck, is seen as cosmetic surgery, which is not normally available on the NHS, so she is fundraising on GoFundMe to help meet the pound, cost of surgery. Steph, who shares her weight loss photos on Instagram to help others, said: “I want to be able to date again, and not have to explain why I have all this excess skin, it’s the one last thing left in my massive change. As well as the tummy tuck and bum lt, I need a boob job because I have so much excess skin there, as well as an arm lt too. And her mum is backing her all the way. Karen said: At her biggest, I was frightened for Steph. “I am overweight myself and we are a big family, but Steph was taking it to the next level. “She was getting bigger and bigger and I knew it was not going to end well. I am so proud of Steph, but now she just needs this final bit of help. She has earned whatever help she can get next.

According to the study, experiences will take up around pound. billion of festive spends this year - thanks to treats such as comedy show tickets, concert tickets and ‘red letter day’ vouchers.  Commissioned by Barclaycard, the research also found one in five plan to buy an experience-based gt for a loved one this Yuletide. Spokesman Daniel Mathieson said: “Brits are fed up with receiving stockings full of socks or the same customary cosmetics and chocolates year after year, we now expect more from our loved ones. “Not only do we want presents that provide entertainment, we want to create long-lasting memories too, meaning for many, physical items no longer cut-it as Christmas gts.” The fun and festivities of Christmas are just around the corner - and wilko has everything you need to make this years celebrations extra special.

Mathieson added: “The emotion and excitement of giving and receiving an experience is something money can’t buy, particularly when it comes to activities that can be shared. “What’s truly heart-warming though, is that people want to spend more time with their friends and family and are choosing presents they can enjoyed together while also providing something to look forward once the festive season is over.”The research was commissioned by Barclaycard to mark its entertainment partnership with Live Nation which offers exclusive  festival pre-sales with  per cent back at the checkout for each and every pre-sale ticket bought through Barclaycard Entertainment.TOP  - EXPERIENCES BRITS ARE GIFTING THIS CHRISTMAS:Theatre   comedy tickets Spa   beauty treatments Concert tickets Meals out  culinary courses Red letter day vouchers Tourist attractions Sporting event tickets e.g. rugby football match Adventure trips e.g. skying, rock climbing Cultural experiences, e.g. art gallery Historical experiences, e.g. visiting National Trust sites"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm diana","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Diana threatens travel chaos - will you be affected The Met Office has warned of a \"major change\" in weather with Storm Diana set to hit the UK with heavy downpours and galesShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video storm-diana-way-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStorm Diana is set to plough into the UK as it moves north through the Atlantic, threatening to cause disruption for millions of Britons. The Met Office is warning of a major change in weather this week as Diana lashes the country with heavy rain and strong gusts of wind. Things will begin to take a turn for the worse on Tuesday before the potentially damaging storm ploughs into western parts of the UK on Wednesday, with every region of the UK expecting rain. It will be wet and windy across much of the country for days with periods of heavy downpours and gales, although it will stay very mild until later in the week. The conditions threaten to disrupt travel and put roads and homes at risk of flooding.  Diana is set to batter the country as the Met Office warns that two-third of Britons have been caught out by recent severe weather. Cold winds that have dominated the UKs weather for the last week will give way to milder air from the west as a slow-moving low pressure system and associated weather fronts sweep in. After temperatures dropped to -C in the north on Sunday night, Monday will remain chilly across the country, with morning mist and fog patches in the Midlands and the south of England. Some roads in Scotland and northern England could have ice patches.  Through the day, there will be scattered and occasionally heavy showers in eastern parts of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.At night, it will be frosty in places and patchy fog may make driving conditions dficult in some areas, the Met Office said. It will then change to wetter and windier weather across the UK from Tuesday, although temperatures will be mild. Storm Diana, named by Portugals national weather service, is expected to slam into the Azores on Tuesday as it moves north towards the UK.  The Met Office has warned of gales and spells of heavy rain for much of the country as Diana merges with another low-pressure system. The latest projection shows Diana and its outer bands moving across parts the island of Ireland before hitting Wales and England. Forecasters are predicting rain for every region in the UK. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris said: “It now looks very likely that we will see a major change in the UK’s weather early in the week ahead. We expect spells of wet and windy weather to sweep across the UK from the south-west from Tuesday, although at the moment there is uncertainty around the timing and the focus for the heaviest rain and strong winds by Wednesday as Storm Diana approaches our shores. Meanwhile, forecasters believe the odds of a white Christmas in the UK are looking very good.

Tragically, half of them were already dead.A decision was then made to put the rest of the whales down due to their poor condition and the remote location, DOC Rakiura Operations Manager Ren Leppens said.  Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low, said Mr Leppens, who described it as the most humane thing to do. However, its always a heart-breaking decision to make.The whales are thought to have been on the beach for perhaps a day before being found in two pods, just over a mile apart. Stewart Island, also know as Rakiura, is home to around  people.New Zealand has one of the worlds highest rates of whale strandings, although the precise cause for it is not known. The DOC said it responds to an average of  incidents a year, mostly for single animals.  Many factors could contribute to such whale and dolphin strandings, including sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather, according to the department.Ten pygmy killer whales were also stranded on Sunday at  Mile Beach on the western coast of the North Island. Two have since died and attempts were being made to refloat the rest. The DOC said the two events were unlikely to be related.About  whales died on a beach at the northwest tip of South Island last year in one of New Zealands largest recorded mass whale strandings.

The presidents forces attacked the vessels and blocked the strait - a major escalation that threatened to start a new war - after claiming the Ukrainian ships had entered Russias territorial waters.  Several Ukrainian sailors were wounded as Russia opened fire and captured two gunboats and a tug boat. Russian forces had placed a tanker under a bridge, which links the peninsula to southern Russia. This was to block vessels from accessing the Sea of Azov, which is shared by the two countries.  Ukrainian MPs are due to vote today on declaring martial law in response.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match. The Argyll Derby kicks off at pm and will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G, weather permitting."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Inveraray Shinty Club will hold its annual awards dinner at the Inveraray Inn on Saturday November .The club will present prizes for player of the year and reflect on a season in which they achieved promotion back to the Marine Harvest Premiership after a three-year gap.Anyone looking for tickets can contact Euan McMurdo on  .The Camanachd Association has become a signatory to the Equality Network’s Scottish LGBT Sports Charter.The charter is a tool for organisations involved in the delivery of sport to visibly support the better inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Scottish sport.By signing up to the charter the association is making a commitment to better include LGBT people in shinty and sending a signal of support for the charters principles of inclusion.Scott Cuthbertson from Equality Network said: #We’re delighted to welcome the Camanachd Association as a signatory to the Scottish LGBT Sports Charter.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge wants to repay the kindness shown to them

industry caused alarm among would-be investors.A Spark spokesman said that the company is still working to merge the parent firm and its workforce with a larger provider.ldquoIf successful, it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

round.They were up against Stuart and Pat McMillan, Willie and Kirsteen Ross, longest married couple Willie and Margaret McLean, and Thomas and Elaine Cameron, the most newlywed couple.MC John Armour asked one half of each couple three questions while the other was out of the room, unable to see or hear the answers given, before they ed and tried to match as many answers as possible.It seemed that theof time married had no bearing on who fared better, with Thomas and Elaine in last place and Willie and Margaret just in front.Gavin and Ina were joined in the top spot by Willie and Kirsteen Ross, with Pat and Stuart in the middle.In the second round, the couples sat back-to-back and were asked five questions.They had to answer, without looking at each other, using a blue paddle to represent the man and a pink paddle to represent the woman.It seemed that every couple was going to get four matching answers, until Gavin and Ina got three, followed by Stuart and Pat who managed five.With positions switching so much, it was all to play for going into the third and fourth rounds.Things took a more physical turn, as one half of each couple raced against the clock to turn their partner into a mummy using two toilet rolls.The slapstick humour continued as each lady tried to burst a balloon hanging from the back of her husband#s trousers using anything but her hands.The ladies became quite creative, using heels, teeth and good old brute force to get the job done!With the results of the last two rounds less clear than those prior, there was a tense wait until the results were

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

I realised I didnrsquot know quite where to start. The feeling of inclusiveness, the uncontaminated landscapes, the astonishing beauty of cities like Edinburgh and the thriving cultural hub of Glasgow, all of these make a person who lands on Scottish soil feel welcomed into a special place.There are so many driving factors that bring people to Scotland and leave a permanent imprint in their minds. There is a good reason why the country was voted as top destination by travel publisher Rough Guides in  ndash it just has so much to offer. But how do the most popular tourist attractions shape up  I set out to find out.National Museum of ScotlandChambers St, Edinburgh EH JFFree www.nms.ac.ukIf someone were to think of a Scottish remake of A Night at The Museum with a sci-fi feel, then the National Museum would be the ideal setting. Besides a rich collection of curiosities from the Victorian age and archaeological relics, it has a scientic section with working models of engines and machines that would wake anybodyrsquos inner child.A solemn Victorian building on the outside, it hides a labyrinth within its walls, at whose heart is a bright and wide central hall connecting all the other sections and a laid-back cafe. Free tours run every day. What I found outstanding, besides the breadth and iety of the permanent exhibitions, ranging from scientic achievement to art and world cultures, is its interactivity and its aim to be a hub for culture and development: the cafes and other spaces where people can sit, relax and explore it bit by bit ndash or just use it as a meeting point. I loved its originality the rooftop, for instance, not only offers a spectacular view on the Old Town and the surroundings, but is also a small botanical garden with historical and geographical information. The section on New Scots is also a reflection of the countryrsquos propensity to embrace foreign cultures. I believe there could be more information provided in foreign languages, so that people whose English is not incredibly fluent could enjoy the exhibits even more. The collections stand up well in comparison to other museums in Europes capital cities.Vote:  Edinburgh CastleCastlehill, Edinburgh EH NGTickets on sitepound poundThe iconic building is like a gem encrusted on top of a hill, watching over the city from above. A very well preserved inner area hosts so many dferent museums and areas of interest it reminded me of a Russian doll ndash there is always something new to discover, a new corner with a dferent, stunning view on the Old Town. Yet its interior, which is rich in detail, is not over-designed, and renovations are good enough not to look, as often happens, like a bad copy of the original. However, despite creating one of the most stunning urban landscapes I have seen around Europe, I have to admit it was not love at first sight when I visited one of the UKrsquos highest rated locations. High season can lead to queuing for around  minutes, battered by rain and chilly wind, for a ticket that was not what I would call cheap. Whereas I understand such a building requires funds to keep running, it is one of the most expensive attractions I have been to. I also find that the absence of a student or young people discount is unfortunate, although discounts are available for children, families, senior citizens and the unemployed. Information around the castle grounds is basic unless the visitor decides to pay for an audio guide . These are well made and available in a very good iety of languages. Staff are present all around the castle and are ready to help visitors. Edinburgh Castle is a magnicent piece of history, however, they should work on their prices.Vote:  Scottish National GalleryThe Mound, Edinburgh EH ELFree With a Da Vinci masterpiece welcoming you as you step into the first exhibition hall, entering the Scottish National Gallery is like walking into a pantheon of myths. A fascinating journey spanning the centuries and crossing the borders of the Old Continent, itrsquos an adventure through artistic treasures, going from Botticelli to Van Gogh, going through the main exponents of Scottish art ndash a feature that, Kelvingrove Museum aside, makes of it a unique collection.Though modest in dimensioncompared to other art galleries across Europe, it is dense in quality and rich in ersity. Itrsquos setting in the old building on The Mound makes it a stupendous landmark on Edinburghrsquos skyline. The interior has a feeling of solemnity and cozy familiarity at the same time. Lights and artworks are very well positioned so that the visitor can enjoy the paintings and sculptures at their best. What I found particularly worth of praise is the amount of information given for each piece of the exhibition: whereas many other galleries would not go beyond basic details such as title, author, a few dates and the technique adopted, the National Gallery provides details and background for each masterpiece, making it easier to the occasional visitor to read through the beauty standing in front of them. It unclosed the gallery, making it more accessible and yet entertaining and educational.The staff itself was very warm and from an international background. On the downside, there was little information for those whose native language was not English, though maps were available in the most common European languages and Chinese. I found it a place where I felt welcomed, and where I would go more often to explore in more detail.Vote:  Riverside MuseumPointhouse Place, Glasgow G RSglasgowle.org.uk museums venues riverside-museumSet on the northern bank of the Clyde, the Riverside Museum stands out from the surroundings for its incredible architecture, a legacy from pioneering architect Zaha Hadid, which looks like a mixture between a urban skyline and an ECG segment. Despite being quite a niche genre of display, this transport museum is strong in its interactive approach and its reconstruction of the ages in which the vehicles were in use. This makes locomotives, trams and cars become something more than a mere model ndash they are part of a frame made of sounds, architectures and colours characterising their times, be it the s or the th century. I found staff particularly helpful and attentive, and two simple cafes offer an occasion to rest. What I think is extremely positive is that free tours are available during the day for groups, which is helpful to gain a deeper knowledge of the objects and on the history of the city as well. Part of the information displayed on screens, positioned in ious parts of the building, is available in the most common European languages and Mandarin, although many details appear only in English. It is good to see that there is information in languages which are now part of the Glasgow community, such as Urdu and Polish, to make it more accessible to families living in the area. Overall, this is a very immersive experience: from one of the first carriages of the Glasgow Subway to the Glenlee, the ship moored on the river outside the museum, itrsquos a true moveable feast back in time.Vote: . Kelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumArgyle St, Glasgow G AGFreeglasgowle.org.uk museums kelvingroveKelvingrove Museumrsquos red walls stand out from the green background of trees of its namesake park, and make it appear even more magnicent and solemn, especially by night, when the lights make it a beautul and a bit sinister sight while it glows through the darkness.I found it a very good starting point to discover the history of this country, especially while going through the paintings and relics of the Scottish Identity in Art section and I appreciated immensely the collection dedicated to local design and Charles Rennie Mackintosh ndash a figure unknown to me before my visit. The free guided tours are very insightful without giving too much information, keeping the visit entertaining and making it easier to take in the concepts passed by the guide. One of the best features is the majestic organ towering over the centre hall: being caught by the resonance of a starting recital while contemplating the ious pieces of the collection or while sipping a coffee in the bar at the ground floor is an utterly pleasant surprise. Moreover, one of the most revered items, namely Christ of St John of the Cross by Salvador Daliacute, is finally back home after a long tour in London and Florida. Set in its own display section, the painting emanates a magnetic aura.Unfortunately, I didnrsquot find any information available in languages other than English, although foreign tourists might benefit from some specic indications. Despite this, Kelvingrove represents a beautul example of a hub dedicated to culture and science.Vote:  OUT OF TOWNLeaving behind the thriving main cities, Scotland is first and foremost known for its sublime outdoors, with landscapes so beautul to often seem unreal. A few of them however seem to attractLoch NessThe legend of the monster is just part of the magnetic attraction that Loch Ness seems to have on the global public. Tourists from all over the world gather ndash a human flow that could easily lead to the transformation of a pure and beautul place in something more similar to a fun park. That has happened, to an extent and tours, cruises and Nessie centres are abundant around Loch Ness shores. Despite this, and in line with an attitude that I particularly appreciate in Scotland, the wilderness and mystic allure of those places have not been altered. The more ldquoboring touristy bits can be avoided by renting a car or going a few steps away the most visited locations ndash the magic is still there.Loch LomondIt is dficult to find a place from which not to adore Loch Lomond, be it walking along its southern shores in Balloch, through the West Highland Way, or crossing the Trossachs National Park by train while heading to the Highlands from Glasgow. I believe people living in Glasgow are extremely lucky to have such an amazing view on their doorstep ndash something that made me fall in love with Scotland. You can drive up from the most industrial centre of the country and you can find yourself lost in nature, with little or no people around you. Its multiple locations make Loch Lomond one of those places to discover bit by bit, getting to know it better each time ndash although it can be tricky to get to places outside the main route without private transport.SkyeThis beautul corner of the world has been in the news due to the influx of tourists which has seen facilities fully booked and ndash at times ndash overwhelmed. On one hand, itrsquos good to see so many people appreciating the breathtaking landscapes of Sligachan, Portree, the Old Man of Storr and many others. On the other hand, the island is probably not equipped as yet to face massive incursions during summer. Something which, I believe, is not entirely a negative side. What Scotland has over other countries is also its ability to preserve its environment, with a respect I wish was present in my home country as well. Although there could be scope for improvement on facilities such as public transport and accommodation, I hope Skye wonrsquot lose its unspoiled beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-st-andrews","story":"As far as visitor attractions go, the home of golf - which also happens to be home to Scotlandrsquos oldest university and some of its most beautul beaches ndash has it all.And although the unique atmosphere of this beautul town in north east Fe never seems to change, the shops and restaurants do move with the times, bringing new le to the cobbled streets.Even when you know St Andrews well, itrsquos a place that constantly draws you back to check out new attractions and reacquaint yourself with old favourites.

I could have got work as a teacher in England but that wasnrsquot possible here.People ask questions like, lsquoHow did you come here  Did you come by aeroplane or by boat rsquo Even though we have British nationality, it seems sometimes that people think we are coming in to drain the welfare system. But the job I had in Accra was a very good one.Irsquom a practising Christian and I do volunteer work with the street pastors. I have experienced racism. I had a particularly bad situation where myself and my children were racially abused on the bus. It went to the courts and the guy was found guilty. In spite of all these things itrsquos still better here. For instance, in Africa our healthcare is poor. Also roads are bad. Ghana has one of the highest rates of death by accident in the world. We have people who have come here and made Scotland their home then gone back to visit their family, and never come back because they boarded a car and had an accident and died.Ruzita Millington, grew up in Singapore.

It was just not what I had imagined. I come from a culture that is quite conservative. I have three children. They know they are Muslims, but they go to Catholic school.

I came in February  and it was a sunny day, but freezing, and I arrived in shorts and a T-shirt from Jamaica. That two minutes walking from my flight to the terminal was my first experience of actually being in the cold.Later, I got headhunted by Gleneagles. Not long after that my parents found a girl for me, in India, and in March  we got married. In  we opened our restaurant, Tabla, in Perth. Somebody recently asked me, lsquoWhy Perth  Yoursquove got so much talent and knowledge. Why not London rsquo The answer was itrsquos not money that motivates me, itrsquos quality of le.

It was meant to be just for one year. Itrsquos been more than  years now. Probably my biggest surprise was how friendly people were. It was strange for a big city like Edinburgh. Itrsquos not the same as in London or Tokyo. Then I moved to Speyside and was a bit worried because it was so remote...but it turned out to be really good.I was let down by the work attitude at first. It was so much dferent than in Japan. The efficiency of the staff, the attention to detailhellip I still think, to be honest, that itrsquos like that. Back home I had to ask only once for something to be done, but here sometimes you have to ask two or three times. But itrsquos a small issue and I love Scotland. I enjoy living here ndash this country welcomed me very well.Working in the whisky industry, I saw that the drinking culture is very dferent. Here, bars close very early, and people rush to get the last drinks, whereas in Japan they are open for longer hours, which means that people take more time to indulge. We do get drunk, too, donrsquot get me wrong, but in a much dferent way.I find that Scottish and Japanese, we are very dferent but also very similar: we donrsquot have big conversations when we meet the first time: it takes a long time to build a relationship, but when it happens, it lasts longer for forever.Vangelis Stamoulis, , came from Athens, Greece, in  to do postgraduate studies at University of Aberdeen. Sales manager in the oil and gas industry.I found the Scottish culture to be very similar to the Greek one: people are very open, sociable and direct and hospitality is great ndash I felt at home almost immediately. One of the surprises was how the weather was, particularly in Aberdeen, being so far in the north. It doesnrsquot change much ndash itrsquos either cold or very cold, you never actually get a summer.What I really like is that you can get in the car and in less than half an hour you are in the middle of an amazing countryside, andyou like hiking, photography, visiting castles or whisky distilleries thatrsquos perfect.I guess that was the most enjoyable aspect: although I live in a city it felt like living in a village. However, Aberdeen is an international city because of the oil and gas industry, you get to meet people from all over the world, and Scottish people are very tolerant with dferent cultures.I think that Brexit is going to affect all of us, both European and British citizens, and will do so in a very bad way.

In our view it is not sufficient that a company states it is not affiliated with the university, while it also claims gowns are made to university specications.: Parents warned of unprecedented school cuts and redundancies\"This is a  endorsement, which we believe constitutes mis-selling of gowns to students who believe they will be of equivalent quality to the official university gown.\"We know student representatives are understandably concerned that students are being led unwittingly to purchase gowns that are dferent from official gowns, which do not support the Student Association or teaching and research within the university as official gowns do, and that a unique student tradition is being diminished by this confusion.

The unions argue that pay has fallen in value over the last decade and they want a % rise as a ldquorestorative measure. Swinney says % is unaffordable and has offered %. A proposed rejig of the main grading scale would also boost incomes.Teachers remain hostile to the offer. A rally in Glasgow, held to promote the pay claim, attracted tens of thousands of supporters. In a consultative ballot last week, around % of members in the two main unions - the EIS and the SSTA - rejected the % offer. A statutory strike vote is getting closer.Swinney could ignore the unions and stick with the % offer, which was formally made by council representatives as part of the tripartite body set up to determine teacher pay. He could argue that no other public sector group is getting close to % and explain that such a rise would go to all teachers, regardless of income, including heads on pound, a year. He could stand his ground.The political reality is he will put more money on the table. Swinney and his Cabinet colleagues are trying to build momentum for a second independence referendum and want to assemble a coalition of voters to tip them over the edge. The SNP Governmentrsquos ultimate objective would not be advanced by tens of thousands of teachers going on strike.Swinney has already antagonised the unions by writing to teachers directly about the % claim. They saw it as an interference in their democratic affairs. It also backfired: after Swinneyrsquos ldquocommunication, teachers overwhelmingly rejected his pay offer. He will now want to dial down the row.What is he likely to do  With extra money coming to Scotland as a result of the UK Government budget, Swinney is in a position to argue for extra resources to bump up the offer. One suggestion is a deal over three years, rather than twelve months. Such an outcome would have the advantage of ensuring that teachers will not cause the Government any more headaches on pay until after the  Holyrood election.Police officers were recently given a multi-year deal and the First Minister last week hinted that a similar offer could be in the pipeline. ldquoPay awards need to be affordable, becausethey are not affordable, they cannot be delivered, she said. ldquoI would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a  per cent pay rise, but that is simply not affordable in a single year.One reason for believing that strike action could be averted is the positive relationship between Swinney and EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan. Whereas EIS members have an increasingly unfavourable opinion of the Education Secretary, the union leader gets on well with Swinney. Asked about him last year, Flanagan said: ldquoI think he is very competent.Back in the s, Flanagan was a Militant Labour councillor in Glasgow whose political career was stymied by the party. He is believed to have a long memory of his treatment by Labour and has constructive relations with the SNP Government. He is also said to be more critical of council umbrella group COSLA than Swinney.However, simply increasing the pay offer creates an additional problem for the Government. Councils employ a range of staff, not just teachers. The unions that represent these workers have made similar arguments about restorative pay claims and they too are limbering up for strike action. If EIS members get %, why should it be lower for those in the GMB, Unite and Unison COSLArsquos position on ldquoparity - which roughly means staff groups receiving the same inflation pay increase - is noteworthy in this respect. Swinney could solve one problem by offering a % rise to teachers, but in the process trigger strike action by the other unions which would want the same for their members. Sturgeon herself raised this point on Thursday by saying that ldquoall public sector workers have suffered because of years of pay restraint.Put another way, consider the range of staff that work in schools as part of the wider ldquoteaching family. If Swinney agreed to a % rise for teachers, heads on pound, would get a pound, boost. By contrast, the lower paid classroom assistants, cleaners and school technicians would get % in one year. It would be a tough sell for any Government that claims to believe in fairness.As Finance Secretary between  and , Swinney had a knack for producing creative solutions to a range of problems involving local government. He will need to be politically nimblehe is to solve the puzzle of the teacher pay dispute.CLASSROOM PAYTeachersPoint pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Headteachers and depute heads can earn between pound, and pound,THE sONE aspect of the current dispute that will be irritating the SNP Government is the repeated comparisons to the Thatcher era, when teachers walked out over pay.Between  and , the EIS led a sustained period of industrial action in protest over pay. John Pollock, the unionrsquos general secretary at the time, said thatthe ldquogrocerrsquos daughter was going to be made to listen, the EIS had to be prepared for a long battle.Action included work to rule and a series of national one day strikes, which included targeting the constituencies of Tory government ministers. Malcolm Rkind, the then Scottish Secretary, responded by announcing an ldquoindependent review into teachersrsquo pay and terms and conditions, after which an agreement was accepted.Over thirty years later, teachers are poised for another strike over pay and opposition politicians are calling for a root and branch review of remunerationWHERE DO THE PARTIES STAND Pay rises for teachers are a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, not Holyrood, but opposition parties can apply pressure on the Government.The Scottish Greens have been most vocal in backing the unionsrsquo demands for a % rise and party co-convener Patrick Harvie has brought the issue to the chamber on more than one occasion. Raising the result on the consultative ballot last week, in which nearly % of teachers who took part rejected a % deal, he said:ldquoNone of us needs a maths teacher to help us to understand those numbers. Can the First Minister recall a more overwhelming democratic mandate from any section of the Scottish workforce Labour has also been supportive of the call for a restorative pay award. MSP Iain Gray, a former teacher, was highly critical of the Governmentrsquos decision to write to teachers directly over the % offer. He also compared the SNP Government to previous Tory administrations:ldquoThe last time Scotlandrsquos teachers were angry enough to go on strike Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was a school teacher, the First Minister was a school pupil and some of the % of current teachers who have just rejected the pay offer were not even born.The Conservatives, who have backed pay restraint at a UK Government level, have not supported a % rise. The Liberal Democrats described the ballot result as an ldquoextraordinary and brutal rebuke to Swinney and have called for a ldquofair deal and an independent expert review."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-must-put-women-in-the-driving-seat-says-richard-leonard","story":"Speaking at the Scottish Labour Womenrsquos Conference on Saturday, Mr Leonard said the party needs to have ldquowomen in the driving seat.There have only been  female MPssince women first gained the right to stand for election to the House of Commons  years ago.Two of the partyrsquos seven Scottish MPs are women, whilst  of the  Scottish Labour MSPs at the Scottish Parliament are women.Addressing the conference, Mr Leonard said:ldquoInfluential and inspiring women in our labour movement, are not just part of our history ndash You are part of our present and future as well.ldquoThat strength and passion lives on, you are both shaping and driving our party, with commitment, resolve and an unwavering belief, in the power of this party and this movement to change lives.ldquoWhile much of that work will be done when we form the next Scottish and UK Labour governments, there are steps that we can take now.ldquoYou are making history here today @LabourRichard #ScotLabwomen # pic PFQhxdVqmdash Scottish Labour WomenNovember , In his speech, the Scottish Labour leader called for: representation on the board of the new Scottish National Investment Bank, which is expected to be established by .Mr Leonard also apologised to the thousands of council workers who went on strike in Glasgow last month calling for the settlement of an equal pay dispute.He said: ldquoWe owe an apology to all of those women workers who were forced to strike for equal pay earlier this month.ldquoWomen who faced, and continue to face obstruction and legal obstacle: in an example of corporate management of the very worst kind.ldquoThey have our support and our solidarity becausewe, the Labour Party, do not represent working class womenrsquos interests on local councils, they are not represented at all.In his speech, Mr Leonard reiterated his calls for the Scottish Government to effectively abolish Westminsterrsquos two-child benefit cap and the so-called ldquorape clause in the Holyrood Budget.He said: ldquoThe two-child cap and resulting rape clause are abhorrent and must be scrapped.

Israel responded to the rockets with air strikes at more than  sites in Gaza. The violence was the worst in the region since the -day conflict in .In August  then Minister for External Affairs Humza Yousaf condemned rocket attacks from Gaza but added that Israelrsquos response was ldquodisproportionate.His assessment was based on the death toll in Gaza, where , people died, including , civilians. On the Israeli side,  soldiers and six civilians died.Michael Oren MKsaid: ldquoI understand the Scottish Government has taken a position on us which is probably the harshest of any political party in Europe. They vie with some of the Swedish parties and the Irish parties.ldquoBut let me say aboutdisproportionality. First of all, it is a gross misreading of international law. I studied international law. Disproportionality says very simply that an army can only use the force necessary to meet the threat. If we use a certain amount of force and rockets continue to fall on our territory then the force cannot be disproportionate, just cannot by definition.ldquoSo, itrsquos a gross misreading and I would say a gratuitous misreading of disproportionality principles. We are in fact,anything, under proportion in our use of force.ldquoMany other societies, most other societies, would use a reckless amount of force to stop rockets falling on civilians. We have not done that. We have the power, boy we have the power. We could end it very quickly.Human Rights organisation Amnesty issued a report on Israel earlier this year which accused the government of ldquocollectively punishing Gazarsquos entire population with an air, land and sea blockade.The blockade has triggered a humanitarian crisis with electricity cuts affecting clean water and sanitation and diminishing health service access. The blockade has rendered Gaza increasingly ldquounliveable, according to the United Nations.Oren said: ldquoI know this is dficult but when you think about Gaza you have to throw out everything you know about everything in human affairs. Irsquoll give you examples. Hamaswants to keep a low light on the humanitarian crisis there but it burnt down a crossing to Gaza three times. It burnt fuel lines to a population which is in any case only getting three hours a day of electricity.ldquoAnd by the way Hamas has   electricity in its tunnels and its bunkers and headquarters. No problems there with electricity, no problems with water.The Scottish Government said its position on the situation in Gaza ldquowas and continues to be in line with much mainstream international opinion.A spokesman for the Scottish Government added: ldquoMore generally, we support international efforts to bring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on working towards a two-state solution."},{"url":null,"title":"top-israeli-politician-celtic-fans-who-fly-palestinian-flag-are-sad","story":"Michael Oren, deputy minister in the Israeli Prime Ministerrsquos office, also said collecting cash at matches for charities thathelp Palestinians is ldquoill-advised.But when asked what he thought about Rangers fans who fly the Israeli flag the politician smiled and said: ldquoI like lsquoem.The Herald revealed in September that the Palestinian and Israeli flags were on a police list of flags which could be a criminal offence to fly in Scotland.A ldquorestricted document issued to officers includes pictures of potentially criminal symbols and a brief description of the laws which may be brokenthey are flown ldquoin a provocative manner.The Israeli flag is flown by loyalists who ldquoalign themselves with Israel due to British support for the state, according to the document.

Perhaps theyrsquoll be watching tomorrow when InSight touches down on that distant world which has so long held sway over the imagination of humanity. Perhaps theyrsquoll realise that the landerrsquos mission is another vital rung placed in the ladder which will inevitably take us sooner rather than later from this blue planet to that red planet.Nasarsquos Insight lander is basically a robot geologist which will unlock the secrets of Mars - including why the planet has no electro-magnetic field to protect it from the sunrsquos deadly radiation. If Mars ever bore le then one theory has it that it was the loss of its magnetic shield which caused that le to end. Andmicroscopic le is still there, it will be hidden beneath the surface away from those killer rays.InSight left Earth in May and is set to make touch down around noon on Monday. The excitement in the space community around Insight is tangible - everyone you speak to can barely contain their anticipation, because InSight underscores that what was once thought impossible is now becoming probable: humankind will one day walk on the surface of our closest planetary neighbour, and most likely colonise it too.However, while that journey now looks very likely to take place in the near future - perhaps as early as the mid-s - the struggle to make it happen is Herculean. Lives will be lost, trillions spent, reputations made, and careers ruined. But when that manned mission happens, it will change humankind forever. Not only will we have become a space-faring species, and secured ourselves from extinction - with humans on two planets it is unlikely we will ever be wiped out by war, weather or any other wild event - but humanity will have created a collective and unying goal that will change how we co-operate across nations and see ourselves and neighbours. It would be the greatest moment of change in the history of humankind - and it will probably happen in our letime. On top of all that, we could also discover whether there was ever - or perhaps even still is - le on Mars, albeit microbial, and answer the most profound of all questions: lsquoAre we alone rsquoSome ask whether the pay-off is worth the risk. Most scientists tend to think like Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded Apollo  on its near fatal mission to the Moon in . lsquoIs it worth it rsquo Lovell asks himself in his mid-west drawl. lsquoUh-huh, itrsquos worth it.rsquoChapter OneFIRST STEPSRight now, in labs and research centres around the world the groundwork is being laid for the future mission. Biologists and chemists are working out how astronauts will take enough water and food to stay alive on a  million mile journey lasting around seven months. Psychologists are trying to establish how a handful of people will endure such a voyage in a gloried tin can and then live together without killing each other while pioneering the harshest environment humanity has ever experienced. Physicists and engineers are designing the sort of rockets and le support systems that will get us there - and hopefully back.Liz Seward, senior strategist at Airbus Defence and Space - which is building the new Mars rover for the European Space Agency at Stevenage in England - says the next decade will be spent learning how humans can live in space. The moon will be used as a testing ground and sometime after  people could be exploring the red planet. lsquoTherersquos water ice there so humans would be able to live there and mine it,rsquo Seward says.Seward thinks that the future of space exploration depends on private companies working with national governments. lsquoGoing into space is quite expensive,rsquo she says, adding: lsquoEventually someone has to pay for it and there has to be a reason to be out there. There are resources you can find on Mars and the Moon and on asteroids that you canrsquot find on Earth.rsquoChapter TwoGETTING THEREElon Musk - one of the richest people in the world and a man who could have stepped from the pages of a sci-fi novel himself - has as his chief project the building of cities on Mars. His company SpaceX has supercharged the new space race.Muskrsquos engineers are designing the Big Falcon Rocket- a fully reusable spacecraft. His team is evangelical - weeping when rockets crash land and ecstatic when a flight goes well.But humanity is still a long way from the goal. lsquoAll we can do right now,rsquo says Jim Green, Nasarsquos planetary science ision director, lsquois land a one tonne rover, to get humans there we need a  tonne spaceship.rsquoThe key is next-generation retro-rockets. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that there is little to slow a spacecraft coming in at Mach . Any ship will need to turn its thrusters to the surface of the planet and fire them up to cause enough drag to land safely. Bladed shields will be indispensable to stop the craft evaporating in the heat of its descent, and even old-fashioned parachutes will be required to add a little extra gravitational pull.Chapter ThreeTHE COLONYSo what do we do once we get there  Most probably the first humans to arrive on Mars will live in their ship - but that couldnrsquot last long due to the effects of solar radiation. Eventually, wersquod have to build some permanent site. This Martian outpost wonrsquot be a series of domes in the arid landscape. Wersquore more likely to set up home in the empty lava tubes of extinct volcanoes - where there might be a chance to find frozen water and where wersquod definitely be much safer from solar rays.A Martian colony would comprise a number of key buildings: therersquod be lsquohabsrsquo for living in a communications and satellite post a medical centre a cargo centre an oxygen creation centre called a lsquoMoxiersquo a water creation centre called a lsquoWarsquo a solar  field a D printer post a nuclear reactor and a mining centre. It would be austere but efficient.Chapter FourTHE FIGHT FOR SURVIVALBut would it be survivable  Astronaut, Scott Kelly, spent a year on the International Space Station, while his twin brother Mark, a former Space Shuttle commander, stayed on Earth, in order to test the long term effects of space travel on the human body. Muscles atrophy, bones weaken, the cardio-vascular system slows, red blood cell production drops, balance deteriorates, eyesight fails, the immune system is hampered. Thatrsquos just the really bad stuff - therersquos also a constant blocked up nose, insomnia, and the dreaded space farts because interplanetary travel means extra gas in the body, not a lot of fun when yoursquore trapped in a command module.So much for the physical effects - what about the mind  Two main projects have tested psychological resilience to space travel: the Hi Seas Mission at Mauna Loa on Hawaii and the Mars  Mission in Russia. In both cases, small crews were kept isolated in a simulated spacecraft for months on end. As all Mars scientists know, the human being must be as resilient as the rocket.From the Mars  experiment, only two crew remained psychologically heathy out of six. Four experienced problems with mood, impulsivity and insomnia. Most were trained astronauts and medics. We still donrsquot know why there were effected, or how to prevent such effects reoccurring.Chapter FiveTHE SWEET SPOTSo once we make the gruelling journey where would we land  Dr Philip Thomas, principal investigator with ExoMars, the joint European-Russian mission hunting for le on the red planet, says until the ExoMars satellite swung over our distant neighbour in  we knew lsquodiddly-squatrsquo. Wersquod only mapped about three percent of Mars. lsquoMoving dunes, dust devils, polar caps, are all now being seen,rsquo he says.Once we have a D map of the planet wersquoll be able to pick the safest, flattest site. Mars is known as the graveyard after all. Nasa historian Roger Launius of the Smithsonian Institute explains that only % of probes sent to Mars are successful in their mission. lsquoThatrsquos not a great track record,rsquo he says.Launias thinks our initial forays to Mars will be a little like our journeys to Antartica. Initially wersquoll explore, then wersquoll build a research station at a sweet spot that is resupplied with people and material from the outside world, and slowly wersquoll build up a presence in an inhospitable land. McMurdo Station in Antartica is now an effective city with many nations working together there.Chapter SixDAILY LIFE ON THE RED PLANETHowever, as the popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson makes clear: lsquoIf you want to stay there, you need to grow your own food.rsquo At first, wersquoll do this is small greenhouses, then giant greenhouses, but in the long-term the plan would be to terraform Mars - to turn the red planet green. Broadly speaking, that means creating a huge greenhouse gas effect to heat the planet and thicken the atmosphere, but as yet we donrsquot have the technology, so when we do get there it looks like wersquoll be living in habs at the bottom of volcanoes and eating greenhouse GM food for a while.Just because we get there, though, it doesnrsquot mean wersquoll survive. The docu-drama Mars, on the National Geographic channel, paints a terrying portrait of le for early settlers - all informed by scientists like deGrasse Tyson. Mars is unforgiving. It kills. Rockets mal, fires break out, minds snap - and a trail of human bodies is left littering the path to humanityrsquos new frontier.Perhaps the greatest risk to human le once we get there is weather. Nasarsquos Jim Green says: lsquoWersquove been studying dust storms for quite some time and therersquos a particular season where some of the dust storms can go global. They can be enormous -  kilometres high. They can get charged and in the case of these really large storms lightning can strike.rsquo These storms can last a month. It sounds impossible to survive.Chapter SevenWHERE THERErsquoS A WILLhellipRichard Nixon was the president who pulled back from the drive to go to Mars, following public concern in the wake of Jim Lovellrsquos Apollo  expedition, and focussed instead on Space Shuttle missions. Many in the space community call the shuttle project lsquogoing into low orbitrsquo as it didnrsquot really take humankind anywhere. It was like giving up on the New World after Columbus sailed to America.With that in mind, loss of le - which many see as inevitable - could derail any Martian exploration. Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian, says: lsquoIf you send astronauts to Mars and they die there, I guarantee you that public opinion will prohibit you from ever doing it again.rsquo Itrsquos little wonder that the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are named after the gods of fear and terror.The thing is, though, humanity has already dreamt of going to Mars. From the ancients through to modern science fiction writers, we have the idea of journeying to, and living on, Mars engrained in our collective consciousness. If yoursquove dreamt something, yoursquoll most likely one day do it.Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Planetary Resources - an asteroid mining company - says: lsquoTherersquos a romanticism about going to Mars and colonising it - and itrsquos a future in which we are building cities. We humans love a target. We love to have something to shoot for, to aim for hellip itrsquos been the case over and over again, whether itrsquos the colonisation of the New World, the railroads, the opening up of the west, all these things are impossible until we make them real.rsquoTHE SCOTS SCIENTIST HELPING PIONEER MARSDR PATRICK Harkness is a modestly-spoken man. Most of us wouldnrsquot be quite as humble about our endeavours as he is - after all, the Glasgow University scientist has developed a key piece of kit without which human exploration of Mars just wouldnrsquot be feasible.On Mars, low gravity makes it almost impossible to drill - the lack of weight means itrsquos extremely hard to get the necessary heft behind drilling machinery to crack the surface. But Harknessrsquos ultrasonic drill removes that problem - and think how important drilling will be on the red planet. As we know, itrsquos more likely we will live underground. Wersquoll also be searching for water beneath the surface, and microbial signs of le - whether long-dead or still alive and kicking - will probably be underground away from killer solar rays.For Harkness, though, there are big ethical questions over what we do with samples found on Mars. The plan for a Mars lsquosample and rsquo mission is already well underway. Its first stage would see a robot mission bring back rocks and possibly even evidence of extinct or extant microbial le. The work done in Glasgow has advanced the science around lsquosample and rsquo, but Harkness worries about the possible risk of Martian rocks contaminating Earth.lsquoWhen you take samples from another planet and bring them to Earth, you have to be absolutely certain they pose no threat,rsquo he says, lsquoand as unlikely as it may appear that there will be any virus or protein in these Martian samples, chances can not be taken.rsquoHarkness speculates the safest plan might be to take the samples no further than the International Space Station and analyse them there. Perhaps, they could be rendered inert on the ISS and then transferred to Earth.Hersquos conscious of the fact that with private companies now potentially leapfrogging governments in the space race that business needs to be regulated in the same way as agencies like Nasa for safetyrsquos sake. lsquoYou need regulation to stop crazy people putting the planet at risk,rsquo Harkness says from his office in the School of Engineering. lsquoTherersquos nothing wrong with doing things privately as long as they are regulated. If people just went to Mars and brought back samples that would be dangerous.rsquoAnother ethical worry for Harkness is the inevitable result of colonisation: babies. lsquoSay someone got pregnant on Mars - then you have a child who didnrsquot chose to be born on another planet. They will grow up experiencing one third of the gravity of Earth so their muscle tone will not be the same, their heart will not be strong enough to pump blood to their brainthey ever ed to Earth.rsquoDespite his caution, hersquos pretty confident that there will be men and women walking on Mars within his letime - and hersquos only . Such a monumental achievement, he said, could well uny our increasingly fractured planet and make Earth a better place for all."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-secrets-of-spiritualists-and-why-its-unlikely-any-of-them-are-going-to-heaven-themselves","story":"Yoursquoll note he didnrsquot mention women, but maybe itrsquos because therersquos simply no requirement for a defined gender ldquoup there.

And when algorithms render us all useless and redundant, itrsquos likely yoursquoll fancy a piece of that action yourself.Supernatural powers dont even seem to be a requirement at one online ldquoPsychic Development Course , so we must assume folk are simply being trained to be good old-fashioned confidence tricksters. Doubt the broo fork out for that one.Even something as innocuous and silly as psychic mailings ndash letters promising spiritual messages ndash is estimated to cost UK believers poundm each year, according to Office of Fair Trading research.Yet, itrsquos newer technological devilry such as online and satellite TV services that have allowed spiritualism to join the dark pantheon of digital cam-sex, casinos and bingo in casting a spell of mass zombied stupor over the nation.Right now, millions are sacricing their dignity in supermarket aisles, scrapping with strangers over yellow Whoops! sticker food items ndash just so they have enough cash to send on a one-way journey to humming servers registered for tax reasons in the Isle of Man ndash chasing the dragon of thrills and comfort clearly missing in their real lives.Tricks of the tradeThe well known terms lsquocold readingrsquo and lsquohot readingrsquo are little more than clever use of what is known to sociologists as the Forer Effectand itrsquos how even the smartest of us can be taken in by those who \"talk to the dead\" and accept all major credit cards - but would likely prefer cash in hand.The bold, brave Derren Brown has masterfully built an admirable career using similar psychological tricky, suggestion and subtle thought manipulaton but at least he and others such as entertainer Keith Barry - who made one of the most successful TedTalks of all time when he guessed the name of a womans ex with just a few quesions - never actually claim to be psychic. Quite the opposite - mentalists like Brown and Barry seem to get a kick out of exposing the woo and deception of ldquoreal mystics who monetise on human weakness and susceptibility. Its the oldest game in town.So why are so many otherwise clever folk fooled  There are countless methods, some learned, some a natural sensitivity to expressions and vocal tics, but herersquos a few familiar and perhaps not so familiar.Firstly, the fact we are social animals who assimilate to our environment and mostly play along with the overarching vibe is one always exploited by mediums. Itrsquos quite clear to psychics that you are not seeing them reluctantly like the docs or dentist - you are there for one very specic reason - and have paid money to get it. Therefore, you want value and will fool even yourself to feel you got it.Secondly, a familiar ldquovagueness of the connection to the spiritual ether allows psychics to backtrack on their many mistakes, using them as ldquofeelers. While they explain to you that the spirit world doesnt always communicate clearly, mibbie still on dial-up, theyrsquore studying each of your facersquos  muscles for the slightest twitch at their vague suggestions of common first names, initials, common cancers and medical conditions, funeral songs, coloured house doors and dog collar material. Its all very mundane in the afterle, it seems.One does wonder why spirits play games with initials. And instead of telling us that you liked the cardigan we wore at the graveyard, tell us what God is like. What has your new plane of existence revealed about the meaning of it all, granny  Oh, you liked the song we chose at the funeral - thanks for coming through from the great beyond to share that. pound well spent, but no receipt.The whistleblowerWe all like to think ourselves as unreadable behind our social masks, but the true is wersquore all pretty much open books to those who know what theyrsquore looking for - especially now in the days of ubiquitous social media. Simple, minute shts in body language, facial expression and plenty of other subtle cues also leave us standing as naked as Cheggars on Channel .One rather simple yet effective trick was part of a confession by psychic-turned-whistleblower Mark Edward, who revealed when customers paid in advance by credit card for the psychic session, the crook on the other side - of the phone, that is - will not only receive the money but be able to see an itemised credit card history. You can certainly tell a lot about people by what they buy over the course of a month. Where they shop, how much they spend, what particular items - its all builds up a very vivid picture.Fortunately for us, whilst the scam is common practice and perfectly legitimate in the US, using credit card details in this way is illegal in the UK. ldquoItrsquos not a gt, says Edward. ldquoItrsquos maybe a skill - but I call it fraud. I have met people who are very intuitive and sensitive but there is nothing supernatural about them. They just assess information that most people donrsquot think about.\"Psychic BrexitersIN a world where a TV advert highlighting the environmental folly of palm oil production is banned, you may wonder how mediums get the green light to advertise that they can contact the dead and predict the future.Well, since , they actually canrsquot ndash and itrsquos how the spiritualist community found unlikely solidarity in another set of confidence trickers ndash the Brexiters.Unamused by folk profiting from the misery and vulnerability of others, the EU brought in new Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations forcing all commercial traders to substantiate claims made about their business ndash not easy for psychics with the whole chatting to the dead thing. They clearly never saw it coming. Humiliated spiritualists have since been forced to describe their once-revered services as ldquofor entertainment purposes only or ldquoan experiment.Perhaps they should be happy theyrsquoll never need to prove their creative fabrications are valid banter from the spirit world. It also seems the EU made a sound prediction itself ndash that in Brexit Britain, more ldquoentertainment will be absolutely necessary to stop us eating each other. And are you not entertained And finally ...MY dad was once interrupted by the police while burying our dog Trudy in the grounds of a local church. ldquoWhat the f*** you playing at, mate  they apparently enquired.I donrsquot know what my dad was playing at either. He had little faith in anything beyond his next ciggie, making Richard Dawkins look like Billy Graham. Yet, he loved that dog ndash and like most of us in our agnostic clouds of fuzzy logic, my dad perhaps thought ldquowell, just in case.So did old Trudyrsquos immortal soul ascend to Heaven  Well, despite never biting anyone, giving a paw for treats and always eating her dinner, no.Yet, one Scottish medium, ldquopsychic barber Gordon Smith ndash the UKrsquos ldquomost accurate, apparently ndash claims my dadrsquos near-arrest was not in vain.He believes Trudy has simply entered another room in the great cosmic house of trans-dimensional planes. Not only that, Gordon claims that he could perhaps even make contact with her. ldquoBecause Irsquom used to having animals around me it feels natural when a deceased pet comes into contact, he is quoted as saying.Gordon recently sold out his rather wittily-named ldquoBest of Both Worlds show at Glasgowrsquos Pavilion. ldquoFor entertainment purposes, stated the poster ndash which, admirably, also makes an effort to clary to his predominantly elderly, perhaps Brexit-inclined audience, that it was the EU to blame for his demotion to mere ldquoentertainer.It might not be such a dogs le for spiritualists in Brexit Britian, however."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8731597.jpg?type=article-full","title":"peoples-vote-gaining-traction-at-westminster-as-brexit-deal-secures-eu-backing","story":"This week, Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, and Stephen Gethins, the SNPrsquos Europe spokesman, are due to have private talks on their parties coming together to back the ldquobest alternative plan to what they regard as the Prime Ministerrsquos botched Brexit deal.

But, as with everything to do with Brexit, things might change.Speculation about Labour warming to a second referendum has been stoked by suggestions that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, held talks with Tom Baldwin and Alastair Campbell, the former respective spin doctors to Ed Miliband and Tony Blair, who are now campaigning for a so-called Peoples Vote.The former Prime Minister told the Andrew Marr Show \"Its moving that way\", adding: \" I would be really surprisedthe Labour Party doesnt end up in the position of supporting another vote because theres no other proposition that can get through Parliament.\"Read more:France would use fishing demands as leverage in post-Brexit trade talksMeanwhile, it is suggested five Remainer ministers - David Lidington, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke - have agreed to try to get Mrs May to adopt a softer Brexit, involving a permanent customs partnership with the EU,she fails to get her current proposal through the Commons.Meanwhile on Tuesday, judges at the European Court of Justice will rule on a case brought by politicians across dferent parties as to whether or not the UK Government could unilaterally end the Article  process and keep Britain in the EU.If they rule that it can, then this option could become the key alternative to Mrs Mayrsquos rejected plan it would mean MPs and not the public voting to keep Britain in the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-back-my-brexit-deal-brussels-wont-offer-a-better-one","story":"The Prime Ministerrsquos bold declaration comes after Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, sought to put his own pressure on MPs by saying that the UK-EU agreement on Brexit was the ldquoonly deal possible.The European Commission President cautioned: ldquoThose who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better one will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.\"EU leaders also emphasised the point with the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar declaring: \"There isnt a Plan B.

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

A recent survey revealed that one in five people had not heard of credit unions, and only two-fths of those questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union. The survey also found that one in four people wrongly believed that credit unions make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign – ‘People, Not Profit’ – aims to highlight that credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, providing loans and savings, and that most people living in Scotland would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live. Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: Date: th November  Time: .pm – .pm Venue: Kirkwall  St Ola Community Centre, Broad Street, Kirkwall, Orkney Islands KW DH sectors.sepa.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing. In  the last islander had left Faray.The islands are home to a colony of grey seals with parts designated as a Site of Special Scientic Interest and Special Area of Conservation.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Monday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose. And – successful woman in a man’s world though she is – that’s not something to celebrate.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834867.1543182253!/image/image.jpg","title":"more children choosing screen time over outdoors activities","story":"Today#s children spend less time in the outdoors than their parents and grandparents, according to a new survey.Nine out of ten mums and dads in the UK say their children play outside less than they did themselves, though most wish they could have more family time together doing nature-based activities.They have blamed lack of free time and their children’s preference for computer games and television.The poll examines the changing relationship between modern families and nature. It found nearly two-thirds of parents questioned said they are too busy to get outside with their offspring as often as they would like.Almost half complained that technology and screen time were taking over children’s lives and making them less interested in the wider world.They believe youngsters are spending too much time looking at their phones or playing online games to appreciate what the natural environment has to offer.According to the research, many of today‘s children have never built a tree swing, made a den, played conkers, flown a kite or camped al-fresco.They have also missed out on playing pooh sticks, collecting leaves and skimming stones.The survey was carried out as part of the Let’s Explore campaign by the Woodland Trust environmental charity and clothing brand Joules, which aims to get more people outside all year round.Contact with nature has been shown to have important benefits for both mental and physical health and well-being.“It’s shocking to think quintessential childhood experiences like playing conkers and den-building are passing by children in the UK,” said Richard Cooper, Nature Detectives project manager for the Woodland Trust.“Our native woods are some of the world’s biggest playgrounds – perfect for adventures. The Woodland Trust wants to inspire the next generation, with over , woods across the country that are free to explore.”Claire Tait, head of marketing at Joules, added: “Whether it’s going on woodland walks, building a den or playing nostalgic games like pooh sticks, every season offers new opportunities to connect with nature and appreciate our woodlands. “Our Let’s Explore activity pack, created with the Woodland Trust, will hopefully encourage and inspire families all over the country to put on their coats and wellies, get outside and explore the great outdoors – whatever the weather.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834923.1543227908!/image/image.jpg","title":"norwegian firm launches 600m faroe petroleum bid","story":"Shares in Aberdeen-based Faroe Petroleum have soared more than  per cent after its largest shareholder launched a # million takeover bid for the company.DNO, a Norwegian firm which already owns more than  per cent of Faroe, said it was offering a “considerable premium” for investors wishing to exit amid the uncertainty of the oil market.Faroe, which is headed by chief executive Graham Stewart, responded to the unsolicited offer with a statement urging investors to take no action in relation to their shares.Some analysts have said the proposal undervalues the company, and urged investors to turn down the “low-ball” offer.The bid confirmed growing speculation that DNO would make an offer, after the company bought its sizeable stake in Faroe earlier this year.DNO’s executive chairman, Bijan Mossa-Rahmani, said in the event of an acquisition, the firm would retain the “skills, knowledge and expertise” of Faroe’s employees.“We intend to retain Faroe’s Aberdeen head office and each of the other offices,” he said.Faroe has operations in the UK, Ireland and Norway. Mossa-Rahmani said that its assets would be “better placed in the bosom” of DNO, which is Norway’s oldest independent oil and gas company.The offer comes on the back of weaker oil prices in recent weeks. The price of Brent crude has tumbled since hitting a four-year high in September, with a barrel trading at  on Monday morning.Analysts at BMO said the offer of p per share was below their valuation of p per share.“DNO’s bid looks opportunistic, coming on the back of recent weakness in commodity markets,” they said.“Faroe’s strong balance sheet and growth trajectory means it is relatively well insulated against short-term oil price moves.”This was echoed by Cantor Fitzgerald, who said: “While DNO’s signicant existing stake may make a takeover now appear ultimately inevitable, in our view investors would be ill-advised to accept what is clearly a “low-ball” offer.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834895.1543221305!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch every scot should see film nae pasaran","story":"The story of the Scottish workers# solidarity against Chile#s General Pinochet is more relevant than ever, writes Lesley Riddoch.It’s , East Kilbride. Bob Fulton, a Rolls-Royce engine inspector, s to his section, upset and anxious. He’s just told colleagues that a Chilean Air Force jet engine has arrived in the factory for maintenance and he’s refusing to let it go through, in protest against the recent military coup of General Pinochet. He’s seen the images of people packed into football stadiums awaiting charge, torture and execution. He’s seen the Chilean Air Force jets bombing Santiago on TV News, and now one of the engines from those very planes is right there, waiting for inspection. He can see his supervisors approaching, he knows he’s about to be fired yet he feels a responsibility to people he will never meet, from another continent, hemisphere and culture.Why  WellBob was living in Chile, not Scotland, he would likely have been in those trucks, on those torture tables and maybe finally in those gutters.As a trade unionist, survivor of war, skilled craftsman and active citizen, the shape of Bob’s entire le produced the conviction that he could and should take a stand.So Bob and his colleagues refused to service the Rolls Royce engines and began the astonishing train of events that placed an almighty Lanarkshire spanner in Pinochet’s mighty killing machine, saving the lives of countless Chilean folk.This story of everyday heroism is being told for the first time – and just in time given the age of participants -- in a film called Nae Pasaran, showing in art-house venues around Scotland and the UK right now. It’s a moving, painstakingly researched, funny and beautully made film which demonstrates the power of solidarity and comradeship among men lucky enough to complete their working lives before our diminished and precarious world of de-unionised, casual employment, out-sourcing and zero hour contracts drew breath. It shows the dogged determination of one filmmaker to track down interviewees across generations and two hemispheres.And, as we stand on the brink of a shameless, corrupt and nakedly greedy milestone in British history – it shows with searing clarity how British society has changed.The relatively confident, moral and organised society of the s produced citizens able to make easy connections between workers across the world. That society has gone – though it’s not completely extinguished in Scotland.Over four intervening decades, Britain has become a byword for political hostility to immigrants and indference to Windrush citizens a country where scapegoating the EU for every British problem and accusing EU nationals of queue-jumping has poisoned the well of democracy so badly that no rational decision about Brexit can be taken for fear of further infuriating a ripped-off underclass of workers with no hope of change in their lives, except a downward spiral into the abject poverty described recently by an UN envoy whose report has been dismissed as impertinent by the UK government.Over the  years that Bob and his friends grew older, retired, watched families grow up and passed on their values to children and grand-children, Britain has morphed into an elitist, market-led society where citizens experience the state as atomised consumers and humiliated claimants – not primarily as well-resourced workers. The British economy depends on the privatisation of natural monopolies and the deregulation of almost everything . Our state acts without pity or mercy, lies as it breathes and uses a balance sheet for a moral compass.So it’s no surprise that Britain refuses to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite the international outcry over Jamal Khashoggi’s killing, the role our weapons continue to play in perpetuating war and famine and the principled stand by Germany, Finland and Denmark who’ve ended arms sales. What a contrast to the s Labour Government which led worldwide condemnation of the military coup in Chile and created an escape route for dissidents until Margaret Thatcher won power and helped prop up Pinochet and his murderous regime.A friend to dictators – that’s what Britain has become. And that’s why Scots desperately need an injection of the insight, determination, morality and clarity of Bob Fulton, John Keenan and Robert Sommerville right now, because we face some massive moral decisions – as voters, workers and citizens.Can every union and worker at Scots-based arms manufacturers just ignore the powerful parallels with  or will just one worker draw inspiration from the men of East Kilbride, and refuse to supply weapons to the Saudi regime Nae Pasaran’s Facebook page contains this powerful observation from a recent viewer: “Many of the folk making bombsights for despots will never work againthey down tools for political reasons. It’s going to take decades to reverse that situation...we ever do. But when I come to be judged, the crime that will send me to the underworld is that my generation allowed the present political class to take power uncontested.”Such abdication of responsibility is just not possible now. Scotland is set to be hauled out of the EU in coming months – out of an arena in which workers rights are taken seriously, trade unions are part of enduring social contracts and respect for human rights underpins international law.If that happens, the journey back to something resembling an equal, caring society will look so long and arduous that many Scots will simply give up. And we can’t. That’s why every Scot should see this filmthey possibly can. Nae Pasaran is testimony to how much Scotland has lost as a society but also how much is retained – above all the knowledge that we have a choice about serving the super-rich, facilitating their wars and creating tools of repression and a choice about remaining in a union that demands our compliance and ignores our political priorities. The old heroes of East Kilbride will stir something in every person lucky enough to see their story.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when the doors will actually re-open for HLH cardholders but there was no response.It is understood the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it. There have been no discussions with them on the route map.Quizzed on their funding role she said there had been no talks with them yet.There have been calls the operator to be removed by owners HIE because of a loss of faith in them and a lack of investment with pound.m pledged in  not materialising.Charlotte Wright, HIE chief executive, said: \"Clearly poundm, even over  years, is a large investment for a single resort, and funding is often the most challenging of all obstacles.\"Highland Council convener Bill Lobban said the uplt review provides \"a fantastic, positive view of the potential future for Cairngorm\".The report also says there should be improved transport links between Cairngorm and the broader Aviemore area to ease pressure on car parking.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117294.jpg","title":"Hotel boss set for talks on Aviemore pool wrangle","story":"Thebossof Macdonald Hotels has said that talks will reopen with Highland Council later this month over access to the Macdonald Aviemore Resort pool.Donald Macdonald, chairman and founder of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said \"there has always been a real willingness on our part to reach a sustainable deal\".Members of High Le Highland have been unable to use the resortrsquos pool since the end of August because of a funding wrangle.The hotel group is seeking more funding than has been put on the table by Highland Council.Macdonald Hotels has mainly remained silent since the end of the summer.But the Strathy received a y statement yesterday from the company on the latest situation, and also criticising a local Highland councillor for his intervention at council headquarters on the wrangle.In the statement, Mr Macdonald said: \"There is nothing that would please us more than having this situation resolved.\"In fact, wersquod already written to the council underlining how keen we were to have further talks and welcomed the positive interventions by Drew Hendry MP and Kate Forbes MSP, who have taken a mature, non-partisan approach to matters.\"He then went on to attack Councillor John Bruce for a question he put before the full council in Inverness a week ago.In it he quizzed leader Margaret Davidson on the role of public money in securing public access for swimming at the resort.The hotel boss described Councillor John Brucersquos question as \"poorly-researched, fatuous and ill-informed\".The statement went on: \"Hersquos showing breath-taking cheek in attempting to re-write history, so itrsquos worth rehearsing the facts, both for his benefit but more so for local people.\"In , a partnership of Bank of Scotland, Tulloch and ourselves brought forward ambitious plans to invest poundm at the Aviemore Resort which had fallen into disrepair after many years of neglect, to the extent that it was described at the time as lsquohaving all the charm of a disused air raid shelterrsquo.\"Given the enormous potential benefits of this scheme to the local and Highland economies, and the large numbers of jobs which would be created, Highlands  Islands Enterprise supported the project with a grant of pound.m - not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"alanah is a real inspiration","story":"ALANAH McGlinchey tells this reporter that it has been “such a boost” to have been the recipient of Inspirational Secondary School Teacher at the recent Andersonstown News Inspirational Youth of the West gala ceremony held in the Devenish Complex.The Religion teacher who has been a familiar face among the halls and corridors of St Louise’s Comprehensive College since  also teaches a Year Nine form class who are still bringing in congratulatory cards and presents for the popular teacher.A graduate of St Mary’s University College, Alanah told the Andersonstown News that she felt “really proud of myself, of St Louise’s and for the pupils when I heard about the Inspirational Youth nomination”.“When it actually happened, that my name was read out on the night, it was just so nice. I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup claims there is a third way on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not a deal at any price.\"The DUPs Westminster leader said the UK has \"ended up with the worst possible outcome\".\"Leave voters are outraged at the betrayal of Brexit and Remain voters are asking what on Earth is the point of losing all our say, but still taking the EUs rules.\"The more people pore over the details, the more problematic the whole mish-mash becomes.\"The political declaration, despite previous promises, does not set out a clear future relationship and raises signicant issues in its own right.\"And the legally binding withdrawal agreement is fatally and fundamentally flawed.\"The DUP - on whose support the Prime Minister depends for her majority in Parliament - has vowed to oppose the draft withdrawal agreement with the EU over its concerns about the Irish backstop arrangement, which is designed to prevent the imposition of a hard border.The party says it cannot support any Brexit arrangements - such as the backstop - which treat Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.The North Belfast MPs call for a rethink comes a day after Mrs Mays planned withdrawal agreement was agreed by European Union leaders meeting in Brussels.But a raft of European leaders have insisted that there will be no more negotiations, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who insisted that the deal agreed by the EU  was final.Mrs Mays deal must now go to the House of Commons for approval - which is by no means certain.In addition to the  DUP MPs, more than  Conservative MPs have indicated their opposition to Mrs Mays deal, as have the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party.Speaking to the Andrew Marr TV show yesterday, DUP leader Arlene Foster called for a Brexit \"third way\", insisting the choice is not between the current draft agreement and no deal.As EU leaders endorsed the proposed legally-binding withdrawal agreement in Brussels, Mrs Foster made clear there were no circumstances under which her party would vote for it when it comes before the House of Commons.\"I believe we should use the time now to look for a third way, a dferent way, a better way,\" she said.She added: \"We shouldnt just accept an outcome for the sake of it - we should try to get a deal that is good for everybody.\"Were not advocating a no deal, were advocating a better deal.

What we should do is wait to see what develops in that respect.\"Pressed on whether a defeat of the EU deal in Parliament would spell the end of Mrs Mays tenure as Prime Minister, Mrs Foster said: \"Thats not a matter for me, thats a matter for her own party.\"On Friday the Chancellor said the Government is considering providing extra border backstop assurances to the DUP. Philip Hammond said ministers have a number of choices through the parliamentary process, which include extending the Brexit implementation period ahead of the permanent relationship.That could avoid having to use a backstop in which the UK would continue to follow EU regulations relating to trade across the Irish border - a solution which is adamantly opposed by the DUP."},{"url":null,"title":"if parliament rejects brexit plan theres no plan b says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The scandal is also making it dficult for patients who are desperate for treatment and are unable to wait for NHS care to see a neurology specialist.The earliest available appointment at two of the biggest private hospitals is in mid-February, while the waiting list at another clinic is six to eight months.It comes as neurologists who work at private clinics are devoting their spare time to running recall clinics and have scaled back on private work.With a shortage of neurologists, NHS neurology waiting lists had already been creeping upwards before the recall was announced.Health officials have insisted the recall process is not impacting upon the waiting times for first outpatient and review appointments.However, David Galloway, director of MS Society NI, said: \"Undoubtedly the recent patient recall has put additional strain on an already stretched service and increased the workload of the dedicated MS specialists who currently hold the service together. I am concerned the recall will impact further on these waiting times.\"The Department has made assurances that first time appointments will not be made worse. The same cannot be guaranteed for review appointments.\"Simply put, many of Dr Watts patients will ultimately need to be added to the caseload of another specialist consultant.\"Mr Galloway said the current crisis being faced by neurology is bringing into sharp focus the dficulty being faced by patients waiting for appointments.He continued: \"The Department of Health announced a review of neurology back in July. \"There is much work for that review to complete in order to tackle waiting times, provide patients with the standard of service they deserve and ensure sustainable, safe working conditions for medical professionals.\"The review needs to engage directly with patients and charities and bring tangible recommendations for improvement which the Department will need to deliver on.\"This review is an important part of restoring public confidence in neurology.\"Northern Ireland Director of Parkinsons UK Nicola Moore said: \"We are very aware of the issues people with Parkinsons are facing in regards to long waiting lists for neurology appointments and continue to highlight our concerns. \"The stress of waiting for an appointment can exacerbate Parkinsons symptoms and cause further deterioration of the health of someone living with the condition.\"Paula Bradshaw, Alliance Party health spokeswoman, said the waiting times are unacceptable.She said long-running promises made by the Department of Health to address problems in the service have not delivered for patients.\"One of my primary concerns is the emotional wellbeing of the patients on the waiting list,\" she said. \"This, in itself, is creating further pressures on the system as conditions worsen and mental wellbeing suffers.\"A spokesman from the Belfast Trust said it is working with the Health  Social Care Board to resolve the situation.He said: \"We appreciate waiting times are much longer than we would like. Across Northern Ireland there is a shortage of neurology consultants for this complex and high demand service and therefore demand is outstripping capacity.\""},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster deeply sorry for dup role in rhi","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs.

Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMVxcXC8yMzE3Mjc0NFxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE4LTEwLTEyLWF0LTE1LjQ2LjEyLTc1MHgzNTAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6Ijk3MmMxMTk4ZmE5YWU1MzJmN2Q4ODNmMTdkODBlMzc4Mjg5MWY1NmIifQ==/screen-shot-2018-10-12-at-15-46-12-750x350.png","title":"irish filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And the provisos we secured and she entered into then.... she is now casting aside.”The most generous comment about Mrs May from the  on Saturday came from Arlene Foster, who said: “I want to acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the prime minister to secure an agreement.“I believe she is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.”However, even that mild support was followed by sharp criticism, with Mrs Foster saying that the draft agreement “fails her own key commitments” and is “not in the national interest”.Mr Dodds also lashed Dublin for its handling of the situation.Although he did not name Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, Mr Dodds delivered explicit criticism of them, accusing them of acting in a way which had made a no-deal Brexit more likely.He said: “There will be those who will continue to exploit Brexit, to try and weaken the Union and to further their own political agendas, but in doing so, they do irreparable damage to the public’s faith in politics and to relationships on these islands.“Be it those using the hard won peace in Northern Ireland as a political football to thwart or delay Brexit.Sam McBride: Arlene Foster is seeking to reinvent herself as a reformist Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Or those in other jurisdictions, trying to play up their republican credentials in advance of a forthcoming general election.

Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission.

He said: “She’s very, very rare because Andre Citroenmade this car just before the Second World War.“He didn’t make any cars during the war because he was primarily a gear maker and he was working on tanks during the war.The  Citroen Traction Avant Light “After the war he made a Light  which had slightly more horsepower so it made the car that I have very rare.“There’s only another four in the UK and this is the only one in Ireland. “They wouldn’t be in the same condition as mine.“I don’t think there’s very many in Europe. My guess would be  or  in total.”David with his third place trophySo is it just a trophy car or is David’s -year-old automobile still roadworthy He said: “I’m still able to drive it though she’s exempt from MOT because she’s actually a historic vehicle rather than a classic car.”Most recently the car did a -mile round trip to Birmingham for one of the largest motor shows in the world on November .Government must act to end witchhunt against ex servicemen, Donaldson tells DUP conferenceArtist, , revisits zoo photos which helped to launch his career Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We drove her from Randalstown to Belfast, across on the ferry to Liverpool then down the M right down to Birmingham.The car during restoration“We did the same on the way back again. It’s around about a  mile trip.“When we got her down that motorway she was like a rally car because of the dust and dirt.“We had to wash her and polish her and get her under the spotlight. Then it was Friday, Saturday and Sunday on show.“It’s fair to say I was like a child in a sweet shop with all the old cars they had on show.”David was extremely proud of his third place finish at the Lancaster Insurance Pride of Ownership motor show in the NEC in Birmingham.He said: “After three days of polishing and preparing and pestering the public for votes we were present with a credible third place in very, very stf opposition. “The show is open for cars from  to . We were up against nearly every car you can think of. “The final was contested by tough opponents including a  Porsche, MG, Jaguar, Bugatti, Lotus Asprit, Daimler, Maserati, BMW and Ford Cosworth.“This was such an amazing achievement and I would like to thank my friends for coming on this long journey over many weeks to present my car a such a prestigious and large event. Asked how he fell in love with motor cars, Citroens in particular he said: “I had three other old cars before this one. They were all Citroens. I’m a Citroen man.“You tend to get people who sway the one way and that’s how they stay.”He said: “When I was a wee boy around Randalstown there was a man who always bought those cars when they were new. “Nobody bought new cars in them days in the s and s.“His cars were always gleaming. I always used to hang around looking at them.“That’s where it started.“It’s the old stuff I really admire. Especially the pre-war stuff with the big sweeping wings.”Despite his passion for historic and classic cars, David does not drive a car on a day to day basis.He said: “I don’t actually drive a car. I was a contractor all my le. I always drove a van. I’ve got a Ford Custom. I’m a Citroen man but also a van man.”David bought the  Citroen Traction Avant Light  in : “I paid in around £, for it but I spent about £, on it. I put all new leather in it, all new door cards , seating, carpets, completely stripped it down to the bare metal and repainted it and rechromed it. “I did all the restorations over a -month period. She’s really just like a new car now.“I bought the car just after I retired to give me something to do, something to poke around at.”David retired from his position as company director of Craigstown Roofing and Cladding Limited around four and half years ago. The company is now run by his nephew.David has been married to Betty for  years.They have no children although David said that his car got so much careful attention that it could be considered part of the family.Asked how long he spends looking after his car, David said: “According to my we – too long.“I do spend a long time looking after it.“I have it sitting in a garage that doesn’t drop below five degrees.“I actually renovated the garage and dropped the ceiling away down so it was easier to heat.“My we saysthe house ever gets cold she’ll go down and sit in the car because it’s warmer.”David sometimes takes his car to Creavery Primary School, where his we works, to show the children.He said: “The children love it.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story POLITICS DUP. Photo credit should read: Michael Cooper PA WireRather than the party being led on this issue by Mrs Foster, there is a sense that the party has led her.The issue was raised in robust terms at a recent meeting of the party executive and DUP councillors are concerned about it hanging over them as they campaign ahead of May’s council elections.Mrs Foster’s supporters point to her having at a very early stage – just a fortnight after BBC Spotlight in December  – made a speech to the Assembly in which she said that the absence of cost controls from the RHI scheme was “the deepest political regret of my time in the House”.However, that carefully calibrated phrase stopped short of an apology and was delivered in the strident tone which has marked most of Mrs Foster’s response to the scandal.While DUP critics will be sceptical about Saturday’s apology coming almost two years later, it is a shrewd move, pre-empting the inevitable criticism of Sir Patrick Coghlin’s report and allowing DUP councillors to point back to Saturday when voters confront them about RHI.The apology fitted into a broader and bolder argument from Mrs Foster who attempted to present herself as an agent of radical change who could fix the problems identied by the RHI Inquiry – even though she has been a senior figure in the Stormont Executive for every moment of the ten years of devolution.And it contained what may be a covert hint of her latest attempt to strike a deal with Sinn Féin to get Stormont back.With last February’s draft deal perishing on the refusal of the DUP to accept Mrs Foster’s willingness to agree to an Irish language act, the leader’s proposal on Saturday for “a new cultural deal for everyone in Northern Ireland that respects dference and fosters understanding” could be the latest incarnation of the proposed Irish legislation, alongside other issues such as Ulster Scots.Whether Mrs Foster’s attempt to reinvent herself as a reformist of the system in which she was a central figure for so long can work will first be determined by whether she can survive the outcome of the RHI Inquiry and then persuade both Sinn Féin and her own party to re-enter Stormont.DUP can’t support Theresa May deal which gives NI no say in EU laws, says Nigel DoddsMan in s tied up during aggravated burglary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”try catch     .               ..

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.
