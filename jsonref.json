The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported a record 171,452 new virus cases on Wednesday, nearly a 40-fold increase from levels in mid-January when Omicron first emerged as the country’s dominant strain. The 99 new deaths were the highest daily tally since 31 December, when the country was grappling with a Delta-driven surge that buckled hospital systems. More than 500 virus patients are now in serious or critical condition, up from around 200 in mid-February, the Associated Press reported. In a long-awaited announcement, the Ministry of Drug and Food Safety said it approved the Pfizer vaccine as the country’s first shot to be used for children aged five to 11. The KDCA said it will announce a vaccine rollout plan for this age group in March. The Pfizer shot is already used for children aged five to 11 in more than 60 countries, including the United States and in the European Union, the MDFS said in a press release. The vaccine will help protect younger children from infections or serious illness amid South Korea’s fast-developing Omicron surge, it added. Teenagers and younger children have been linked to a rising number of infections in recent weeks, according to KDCA data. One parent, insurance agent Emily Kwong, 30, said she was struggling to home-school her five-year-old daughter and is worried she has learned nothing. New plans to close schools early in March are “disturbing the whole year”, she said.For many children, the absence from friends and a physical space to learn is adding to anxiety. One teacher at an international school said:  Belinda Greer, chief executive of the English Schools Foundation which has 18,000 pupils across 22 schools, said she had relayed concerns to the government and was working to minimise disruption. For pupils taking external exams this year, there would be some flexibility, she added.Many families in the Chinese-ruled territory live in tiny, high-rise apartments with several people over three generations, making online learning particularly difficult, with sometimes patchy WiFi connections.The companies said they intended to submit data to regulators from a late-stage trial of the vaccine, and another testing it as a booster, with full results for both studies expected to be published “later this year”. Sanofi is hoping for a comeback after falling behind in the race for coronavirus vaccines, while GSK, the world’s biggest vaccine maker by sales, has not developed its own candidate and is instead supplying its adjuvant technology to developers. The first phase of the change in rules will begin with loosening measures for the unvaccinated, and cancelling crowd limits at a later date.  The first phase of the loosening will begin on 26 February, and a second phase will follow on 26 March to end limits on crowds and opening hours.The airport has said that it’s performance in comparison with rival airports in Europe has been due to the UK’s tighter restrictions on European travel.  These tighter restrictions include the fact that quarantine hotels remained in operation in the UK for several months after they were scrapped in most other European nations, and that later in 2021, the UK was the only country in Europe requiring both a pre-departure test and post-arrival test for all arrivals, regardless of vaccination status. John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said that 2021 was “the worst year in Heathrow’s history”.  But Holland-Kaye said demand is “starting to recover” and the airport is working with airlines to “scale up our operations”. Heathrow Terminal 4 will be reopened by July for the peak summer season when passenger numbers are expected to increase.  Holland-Kaye added: “We’re excited to welcome more passengers back to Heathrow to experience the joys of travel and get Britain’s economy firing on all cylinders again.” If you would like to share your experiences, please have a look at the link below.  Heathrow had the most, with 4,910 flights, followed by Manchester (1,548 flights) and Gatwick (1,044 flights). TfL has said it has “considered a variety of factors including the shift in the government’s approach towards living with the virus and decreasing infection rates in London”. The government scrapped the requirement for people in England to wear face coverings on public transport on 27 January, but TfL kept the rule on its services. Despite face coverings being dropped as a condition of carriage, TfL said it “strongly encourages” passengers to continue to wear them to “keep each other as safe as possible”.The analysis, conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), is the first of its kind to prioritise a higher threshold for antibodies, which better reflects the proportion of people likely to have a strong enough antibody response to provide some protection from a Covid-19 infection. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. I’ll be back tomorrow but my colleague Tobi Thomas will be along shortly. Bye for now.Cambridge scientists found the measure was particularly effective for travellers aged 16-20, PA Media reported. The requirement for people arriving in England to self-isolate for a fortnight was introduced on 8 June 2020, after the first few months of the pandemic. Exemptions were only available for certain people, such as those arriving from destinations where a travel corridor was in place. The list of travel corridors was repeatedly amended for several months, with popular destinations such as Spain, France, Portugal and Italy added and removed. The restrictions received fierce criticism from the travel industry due to the impact on demand. In research published in the journal Nature Communications, scientists analysed contact-tracing data from NHS Test and Trace and genome sequences made available through Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (Cog-UK). They compared the number of contacts reported per case for international arrivals before they were diagnosed with the virus. The analysis estimated that travellers with Covid arriving from a location without a travel corridor had an average of 3.5 contacts. Those who did not need to quarantine had an average of 5.9 contacts, meaning they were more likely to pass on the infection to others. The number of contacts was highest in the 16-20 age group.The Department of Health and Social Care is trying to make savings from its budget to fund free lateral flow tests for elderly people, Covid surveillance studies and genomic sequencing, after the Treasury refused its request for £5bn in extra funding. Although the government announced an end to most free mass testing and contract tracing on Monday, remaining Covid measures are expected to cost more than £1bn. The Treasury and the DHSC refused to say exactly how much cash would be needed or which services would have to be cut back, prompting fears the NHS could have to find savings at a time of a huge waiting list backlog. It is understood that DHSC officials are working on identifying savings in the department’s £178.5bn budget for 2022-23, to fund the measures agreed on Monday, including maintaining a “baseline” testing capability that can be scaled up if necessary.

Video: ReutersA man with a stuffed koala toy and flowers at the arrival hall at the international terminal of Sydney Airport. Photograph: Brent LewinBloombergAustralia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against Covid-19 after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings, as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.More than 50 international flights were to reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by Covid-19 restrictions.Most regions of the country were reopening to all fully vaccinated visa-holders without restrictions or exemption requirements. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs warned on Monday that arrivals into Western Australia, including Perth, will have to quarantine on arrival, with this arrangement in place until at least March 3rd.“It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss, who travelled from the US state of Kentucky to see her daughter.“I just haven’t seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I’m so excited,” she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.Tourism is one of Australia’s biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion (€38 billion) a year and employing about 5 per cent of the country’s workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.Once a champion of Covid-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.PartyingPassengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with “Welcome Back World!” painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying “You were worth the wait”.“It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people’s faces, they will be dancing soon, I’m sure,” Australia’s minister for tourism Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney Airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, the famed Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.Mr Tehan said he was hopeful for a “very strong” rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week. Virgin Australia said it was seeing positive trends in domestic bookings and continued to assess demand for international flights.All trains in Sydney, meanwhile, were cancelled on Monday after pay disputes between a union and the state government, taking some shine off the reopening.As borders reopen, Australia’s outbreak of the Omicron Covid-19 variant appears to have passed its peak, with hospital admissions steadily falling over the past three weeks. The bulk of Australia’s pandemic total of about 2.7 million confirmed cases has been detected since the emergence of Omicron in late November. Total deaths stood at 4,929.Just in excess of 17,000 new cases and 17 deaths were registered by midday on Monday, with the Northern Territory due to report its figures later. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"putin s options what might russia s president do next","story":"Russia’s president Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of his security council in the Kremlin on Monday. Photograph: Sputnik via APAs Vladimir Putin announced that his decision to recognise two Moscow-backed separatist states in the Donbas extended to large swaths of Ukraine-controlled territory, the Russian president made it clear his options were not at an end.“Predicting any kind of specific outline for possible actions is totally impossible. It depends on the concrete situation that takes place on the ground,” Putin said on Tuesday.The decision to send Russian troops on a “peacekeeping” operation into the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics essentially buries the Minsk agreements to try to end the conflict, which has killed more than 14,000 people since 2014.But Putin, who has massed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, has previously hinted he is contemplating “all kinds” of further options – outlined here – that western countries warn could end in a full-scale assault on Kyiv.Exert more diplomatic pressureDuring an extraordinary televised session of his security council on Monday, Putin grilled his top officials for their stance on recognising the separatists.The prospect, and implied likelihood of war with Ukraine, made even some of his most hawkish advisers visibly uncomfortable. Nikolai Patrushev, security council secretary, suggested that Putin delay recognition for “two or three days” and used the threat as leverage to force Ukraine to “stop all this bloodshed”.Though Putin has pressed ahead with recognition, he could be calculating that the spectre of future conflict is enough to secure concessions from the US and Nato. US secretary of state Antony Blinken was set to meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov but cancelled the talks. The Kremlin said French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz had expressed an interest in further discussions during a call with Putin.A settlement based on the current state of play would go further than the aftermath of Russia’s 2008 war in Georgia, when it sent troops to protect the separatist enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Putin demanded Kyiv “demilitarise”, recognise Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula, give up its ambitions to join Nato and pledge neutrality, and negotiate the disputed borders in the Donbas with the separatists.Kyiv sees all those requirements as unacceptable and has refused to negotiate with the separatists throughout the conflict on the grounds they are Russian proxies.If a drawn-out negotiation process begins, however, recognising the separatists and ripping up the Minsk agreements may satisfy Putin’s goals for now, according to a former senior Kremlin official.“It’s better to have a horrific end than an endless horror,” the official said. “A chicken pecks at one grain at a time, not all at once.”Bring more territory under Russian control in the DonbasLuhansk and Donetsk, the two Ukrainian provinces of the eastern Donbas region, are only about one-third controlled by the separatists now recognised by Russia. But separatist officials in Luhansk demanded on Tuesday that Ukraine remove its troops from the Kyiv-controlled parts of the province and threatened they would “take measures to restore the territorial integrity of the republic” if ignored.Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Russia’s interior minister, raised the prospect of recognising the separatists’ “historical borders” in 2014 which encompassed the entire Donbas before they were “occupied by the Ukrainian armed forces”, and Putin later said Moscow recognised separatists’ claim to the entire Donbas region.If, as is likely, the Donbas border dispute cannot be solved by negotiations, Russia’s overwhelming firepower could quickly beat back Ukraine’s army and seize control of the territory, analysts say.As lawmakers prepared to ratify recognition on Monday, they watched a video of a December speech by far-right firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who predicted Putin’s moves almost to the hour – and hinted how far he could go.‘False-flag’ operationsThough Russia’s forces have been present there throughout the conflict and turned the tide during its active phases in 2014 and 2015, the Kremlin denied it was a party to the conflict despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Even as those claims became increasingly less credible, the obfuscation allowed Russia to paint the war as an “inter-Ukrainian event” and mask casualties among its forces.Recognising the separatists changes that. The treaties between Moscow and the separatists, signed in a ceremony involving Putin on Monday night, will allow Russia to set up military bases in separatist territory and guard its borders.An official troop presence raises the prospect for Russia to claim its forces have come under fire from Ukrainian attack. Moscow’s security services and state TV have backed up evidence-free claims by the separatists that Ukraine has intensified artillery fire and “terrorist attacks”.On Monday, Russia claimed it had exchanged fire with Ukrainian forces for the first time in the eight-year conflict.Putin said that Russia’s troops would not necessarily go in to the Donbas “right now” but warned that Moscow would “fulfil the obligations it has undertaken if necessary.”Further clashes – a prospect the US has warned of as “phoney allegations” – would potentially give Putin a pretext to retake the entire Donbas or launch a larger operation against Ukraine.“I can’t imagine how he’d justify an assault on Kyiv, but I don’t see any alternative,” she added. “The goal is to end Ukraine’s existence in its current form. No Ukraine, no problem.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"imperial russia has called wests bluff","story":"Where does it end? Vladimir Putin has now made plain the way he sees the world. Ukraine, he declared on Monday night, is made up of “what was historically Russia” and its claim to statehood has never been legitimate. Thus, the claim to nationhood of a country that voted by more than 90 per cent to become independent after the fall of the USSR is airbrushed out of history.Here’s the stomach-churning fact for everyone else east of Berlin: there is an awful lot of land in Europe that a Russian imperialist might define as being “historically Russia”. How much of it will Mr Putin generously decide to reunite with the motherland?The answer surely depends on Nato: Mr Putin’s territorial demands ultimately only end at the point where Nato countries are willing to make them end. That is the logic of his angry address to Russia and the world on Monday.The problem with the old Soviet Union, he argued, is that it wasn’t ambitious enough. All of the territories it controlled as Soviet republics should always have just been Russian provinces, he declared, if only the Communist Party hadn’t given too much away to nationalist demands. Mr Putin isn’t nostalgic for the heyday of the USSR. He’s reaching for the tsars.To take this entirely seriously for a moment, it implies a truly breath-taking territorial shopping list. At a minimum, all three Baltic states, Finland and much of Poland, Moldova and Georgia can wave goodbye to sovereignty. Some parts of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia are surely on the table. Eastwards, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan might all need to reassess their national maps. Hell, why not even throw in Alaska? It was once “historically Russia” too.Here is what history will record as the UK’s iron-fisted response to this doctrine of megalomania: we froze the assets of five banks and three Russian oligarchs. This, apparently, was the devastating package that Boris Johnson had promised to unleash the moment “the first Russian toe-cap” crossed the border into Ukraine. Perhaps he was wriggling out on a technicality: tanks, as far as I’m aware, don’t have toecaps.He called it “the first barrage of what we are prepared to do”. But the military metaphor only serves to draw more attention to the pathetic reality that the West is turning up to a gunfight with a spreadsheet – and it’s not even a very powerful spreadsheet at that.Russia has spent the years since the 2014 Crimea sanctions making itself almost financially impregnable. It has a ready supply of dollars from its oil and gas sales and hardly needs to borrow externally at all. So the only way even to ruffle Mr Putin’s feathers is to go after the wealth and prestige of his cronies with the same degree of commitment and force with which he likes to invade countries. Three oligarchs, I suppose, is a start.Berlin has at least surpassed its much-debated aid package to Ukraine of 5,000 helmets by declaring that Nord Stream 2, Mr Putin’s coveted new gas pipeline, isn’t going to be certified. This is substantial progress, given the lethargic state of German public opinion on Russia up to now.But even this act of resolution looks uncertain. The certification process has been suspended Berlin has not quite said that it will be legally unwinding the pipeline, and the construction is already complete. Are we going to see Germany dismantle the thing?Our ultimate problem is that we have spent too many years saying things we don’t mean, and Moscow is calling our bluff. After all, Ukraine was never a Nato member, but it still supposedly enjoyed a Western guarantee of its territorial integrity.It would be wise for Western leaders to stop exaggerating their resolve and over-promising all sorts of tough actions that never materialise. It’s the sort of mistake that, uncorrected, winds up landing us all in a confrontation between nuclear-armed powers.Let’s instead focus on two things: delivering the “severe” sanctions our governments have talked so much about and then working out what Nato’s new red line really is and how the alliance will declare what it is and credibly defend it.Mr Putin has staked a new claim to imperial domination. Nato must answer him with more than a fresh onslaught of empty words.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson announces extra defensive weapons are being sent to UkraineMitt Romney was right about Russia all along, Democrats admitTories will keep Russia-linked donations totalling £1.93 million, says Liz TrussIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Duchess of Cambridge meets Denmark\u0026#39s Queen Margrethe and Crown Princess MaryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three pictures tell us putin power","story":"There are plenty of mysteries surrounding the character, history and motivations of Vladimir Putin but, over the 23 years he’s spent as a world leader, we have at least grown used to one unassailable fact: nothing he does is accidental. The weightlifting videos, the military exercises, the horseback-riding without a shirt – everything the Russian president presents to the world is about image, and the messages aren’t subtle. In fact, subtlety would be a waste – he’s a drama queen at heart. It has never seemed coincidental that Vladislav Surkov, one of the founding fathers of Putinism and once a key figure within the administration, trained as a theatre director until he was sacked for fighting. The plots aren’t always tight, but they’re certainly tense. In recent days, as photos of Putin holding failed meetings to discuss the Ukraine crisis have held front pages around the globe, the image-making has been as intentional as ever. Sometimes it’s in the little details, sometimes it’s hidden in the backdrop, sometimes it’s in the massive, massive table, but every image tells us a little more about his grip on power.Picture 1: The Kremlin meeting of the Security Council1. The venueVladimir Putin has a lot of rooms he could use for meetings (there are 700 in the Kremlin Grand Palace alone), and everybody present at Monday’s gathering of top security officials could easily have squeezed into the usual cabinet room. As it was, he convened them in the vast, grandiloquent Hall of the Order of St Catherine.It could be a hygiene precaution for the deeply Covid-phobic leader, but unlike Emmanuel Macron or Olaf Scholz, it seems unlikely those in the room wouldn’t have acquiesced to a PCR, so this was all about the photo-op in the former throne room of the Russian Empresses.  In the past it has also been the venue for Thatcher meeting Gorbachov, Nixon meeting Brezhnev, and Putin\u0027s annexing of Crimea. Usually, it is used for peaceful state receptions, occasional press conferences and high-profile international negotiations. Not internal matters and definitely not with the bizarre seating arrangement of Monday’s meeting. This was classic Putin set-dressing. 2. The set-upWhy are all these senior officials in the Russian government – including the spy chief and iniduals with decades of loyalty to Putin – arranged like the audition scene from The Producers? The answer, of course, is for maximum pressure and pantomime – making it crystal clear that this may be a government in name, but only one man is calling the shots. Yesterday morning, footage of Putin rendering Sergei Naryshkin, chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, a quivering wreck by barking at him across this echoing hall in front of his peers, went viral. Putin would be absolutely delighted with that result.3. The watchAs any action movie auteur could tell you, there is no allegory for urgency quite like a literal close up of a ticking clock. And in this meeting, Putin took off his (potentially Blancpain Grande Date Aqua Lung, a favourite from his luxury collection) wristwatch part way through, and placed it in front of him as you might in a GCSE exam. This is a man famous for being hours late, who lets meetings run on half the night, and is occasionally accused of editing footage to fit a more convenient time-frame – like yesterday, when some onlookers noticed the watches of those in attendance didn’t always line up with the reported time. The message? Chop chop, people, I have things to do. Later in the night, we found out what...Picture 2: The televised address1. The terrifying deskThere are a few standout things to notice about the office from which Putin gave his lengthy televised address on Monday night. The totally blank desk, the screensaver showing the outside of the very building he’s in (no offence intended, anybody whose lockscreen is their own house), the menacing white button that may or may not be connected to his nuclear arsenal. Is that a lesser-spotted Amstrad ‘e-mailer’ phone in front of the computer? What is that massive television monitor next to his PC for – watching the History Channel’s Ice Road Truckers while pretending to work? When saying something terrifying, like declaring an invasion, it’s good to offer distractions.2. The phonesDespite being a former spy, Putin is also an inveterate technophobe, who reportedly hates mobile phones and computers, preferring briefing folders, secure landlines and pen and paper. It was said that eight years ago, when US agencies attempted to figure out what was going on inside his camp during Russia’s takeover of Crimea, they were met by nothing but silence. Nothing to listen in on, nothing to intercept, nothing to give the game away.What we didn’t know was that he liked old-fashioned phones so much as to have three on his desk, including one with only one button in the middle, and what looks like Dr Dre’s mixing desk underneath them all. “Does President Putin run his own switchboard?” comedian David Mitchell asked on Twitter yesterday. Well, does he?3. Those pot plantsIt’s difficult to imagine Putin tending to this pair of pot plants, which look like they may belong to the dieffenbachia family and stand awkwardly in an otherwise devastatingly lifeless room, but he is a lover of the natural world, and may have even insisted on their appointment to that eminent corner of the room behind his bank of phones. Once, he even wrote that he likes “events in which fauna take part”. Nicholas II had Rasputin Putin has these two. 4. The face of the organisationThis isn’t a tried and tested theory, but could it be that, over the past two decades, Vladimir Putin has attempted to match the growth of Russia with an equally rapacious and worrying expansion of his own face via the medium of industrial-strength fillers? Photographs of him in 1998 look like a different man. He is nothing if not committed to visual metaphors.Picture 3: Another big table1. More oversized furnitureMuch has been made of Putin’s shuffleboard table diplomacy. Last week’s meeting with Emmanuel Macron, which might as well have been conducted on Zoom as they were effectively sitting in different countries, resulted in a vast international effort – to create memes. And here he is again, at his usual cabinet table, making absolutely sure that foreign minister Sergey Lavrov couldn’t touch him with a bargepole, let alone any accidental spittle.Putin, projecting his Tsarist side as ever, is at the head of the table, with Lavrov, who has been in his post since 2004, stuck down one side, only just fitting into frame. Putin is cautiously distant from even his most loyal subjects this is not a man with deputies as we understand it. As the saying goes, keep your friends really far away, and your enemies even further. 2. The rogue applianceIn Britain, Henry the Hoover manages to creep into any room he wishes – nobody questions that little suck-up’s face. In Russia it appears his counterpart is a mysterious white appliance on wheels – could it be a two-bar heater? An emergency trouser press? A defibrillator, for if the tension all gets a bit much? It was there behind Putin at the Macron meeting, and now here it is again, lurking beside a small side table, pumping out hot air or poison or Dettol or nothing. 3. His favourite chairAlways consistent, you will notice this (quite uncomfortable-looking, and presumably low-slung, given he is 5ft 7ins) style of chair in almost all Putin’s Kremlin photographs. It may not be the same one, but we do know he is a creature of habit.When he became prime minister and allowed Dmitry Medvedev to be president from 2008 to 2012, Putin reportedly kept sitting in his same old chair, on the left of the president’s office, while Medvedev took the right, usually reserved for guests. A first photograph of the pair meeting to discuss the cabinet sent a clear signal to world leaders and investors alike: the boss might be different, but the chairman’s the same.4. Yet more buttonsIs it possible that these random, chunky coloured buttons in the foreground don’t do something nefarious? Sure, they probably turn on the air con. But do the Kremlin photographers, and by extension Putin himself, know we will ask the question? Also yes. It’s all about perception.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson announces extra defensive weapons are being sent to UkraineMitt Romney was right about Russia all along, Democrats admitTories will keep Russia-linked donations totalling £1.93 million, says Liz TrussIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Duchess of Cambridge meets Denmark\u0026#39s Queen Margrethe and Crown Princess MaryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starmer cant forgiven backing corbyn pm","story":"Whenever I begin to think positively about Sir Keir Starmer, I usually receive a jolt back into reality when I remember that he was only too happy to serve for three years as a leading light in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. Not only that, but he campaigned to make him prime minister.We had a lucky escape. On Monday, Jezza rose from the backest of backbenches and appeared to intimate that the Ukraine crisis was all the West’s fault. More specifically, he asked Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, if Nato would withdraw troops “from the border” (of where?) if Russia did the same – as if Vladimir Putin’s demands were in any way justified.Corbyn was rightly given short shrift by Wallace. Corbyn’s extremist position is the same as that adopted by the Stop the War Coalition, which he chairs. They seem to buy into the Nato encirclement myth propagated by the Kremlin. Even in the statement the group issued yesterday, which called on Russia to withdraw troops from eastern Ukraine, it couldn’t help blaming the conflict in part on “the expansion of Nato and US hegemony at the expense of other countries”. Britain, it said bizarrely, had played a “provocative role”.The Stop the War Coalition may contain some people who are genuine pacifists, but many others, I suspect, are fellow-travelling Russian sympathisers. I call them Fifth Columnists.Starmer has been robust on Ukraine, a fact noted even by Boris Johnson in the Commons yesterday. He is taking Labour back to its roots: we joined Nato under Attlee and Bevin and successive Labour leaders have been stalwart supporters of the alliance. But too many of Starmer’s MPs are far-Left sympathisers of Corbyn’s ridiculous position. He needs to get rid of them, as they totally undermine any sensible words he has to say on defence policy.One thing is certain. Corbyn will never be allowed back into the Parliamentary Labour Party. Just imagine if he’d won the 2019 general election and was now prime minister. He’d probably be offering logistical support to Russia. I jest. I think.Macron\u0027s shameAnother leader who has not had a good crisis is Emmanuel Macron. I suspect I am not alone in thinking that the preening French president will be feeling somewhat humiliated by his treatment at Vladimir Putin’s hands.He left his lengthy meeting with the Russian president clutching a piece of paper which read “Peace in our time”. Well, he might as well have done. He certainly seemed to believe that he was the man to bring Russia and the West together in a grand bargain to avert war – a bit like the Munich Agreement of 1938. What he didn’t seem to realise is that it is impossible to appease dictators. Worse, Macron’s “deal” had the effect of upsetting the Ukrainians, who were not party to the discussions and saw them as a threat to their sovereignty.How ironic that the most meaningful statement on Ukraine has not been issued by Britain, France or Germany, but by Kenya, which is currently on the UN Security Council. The country’s representative, Martin Kimani, issued an extraordinarily clear-sighted message to Monday’s emergency meeting. He condemned the breach of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. He said the UN Charter was beginning to wilt “under the relentless assault of the powerful”. He pointed out that Kenya, like many other African countries, had had its borders drawn by European powers, but that they had chosen to accept them. But thanks to Putin’s modern-day imperialism, “multilateralism lies on its deathbed”.It shouldn’t have to fall to Kenya to elucidate the principles that are at stake now. What we are witnessing is the dismantling of the international architecture that protected weak powers against the strong. This is what Macron was seemingly prepared to overlook in his dealings with Putin. France is a proud nation, but its president has brought shame on it, all in the aid of looking grand on the world stage, only weeks before a presidential election.The Electoral Commission is failingAll governments should beware of the monsters they create when they form new quangos, even when it’s done for the best of reasons. Before Tony Blair, electoral issues and processes were handled by the Home Office. It was one of the few things it did well. But in 2001, those functions were taken over by the Electoral Commission. It’s been a disaster. And now it has the cheek to complain that the Government’s reform plans could jeopardise its independence. That well known political sage, Hugh Grant, is terrified. He says the reforms represent “another nail in the coffin of British democracy”.There are plenty of reasons to believe that the Electoral Commission is ripe for reform. The way it treated the Brexiteer Darren Grimes would be reason enough. Were there postal vote scandals before 2000? Rarely. Were there huge problems with the electoral register before 2000? There are now. If we are to have an independent body in charge of our elections, it needs to enjoy the confidence of all sides of the political spectrum. The unreformed Electoral Commission no longer does.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson announces extra defensive weapons are being sent to UkraineMitt Romney was right about Russia all along, Democrats admitTories will keep Russia-linked donations totalling £1.93 million, says Liz TrussIn pictures: Russian troops and tanks enter Ukraine Duchess of Cambridge meets Denmark\u0026#39s Queen Margrethe and Crown Princess MaryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes set announced","story":"All the Covid rule changes set to be announced by Boris Johnson TODAY as isolation axedCovid isolation rule changes and the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed are likely in Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ plan, due to be published today.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

However, several cabinet ministers opposed the proposalsJacob Rees-Mogg is said to have argued the Government should not be limiting personal choice Image: REUTERSByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Feb |comments Measures to ban imports of cruel fur and foie gras are being opposed by Jacob Rees-Mogg and other top Tories.The plans were due to be included in the forthcoming Animals Abroad Bill. But several Cabinet ministers have opposed the proposals. Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is said to have argued the Government should not be limiting personal choice. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also raised concerns last year about using faux bear fur in hats worn by Guardsmen.Animal Welfare Minister Lord Goldsmith has previously said the bans would be made law at “the earliest possible slot”.  But sources in his department reportedly said: “The MoD is refusing to compromise on this. Wallace is believed to be very anti-change.” Animal campaigners have condemned moves to scrap the ban. TV presenter Chris Packham said abandoning plans would be an “appalling betrayal of animals who desperately need a kind nation to defend them”. Claire Bass, of Humane Society ­International UK, said: “The vast majority of the public fully support these bans, to send a global message we won’t be complicit in the suffering of millions of animals for cruel, unnecessary products. “We urge the Government to base its policy on public opinion and evidence, not the whims and fancies of one or two out-of-touch ministers.”  Conor Jackson, founder of Open Cages, said: “Thanks to them protecting our ‘personal choice’, we will soon be justying pretty much any cruelty.” Abigail Penny, of Animal Equality UK, added: “Backtracking on a ban would be the ultimate betrayal of animals and the British public.” Since the Mirror launched the Fur Free Britain campaign with Humane Society International UK in July , we have revealed horric cases of fur farms abroad.

We are also ready to impose swt and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions. Tory Minister Paul Scully said there were , more Russian troops on the Ukrainian border than there were a few days ago despite the Russians trying to signal the fact they were pulling away from the border.He told Sky News: There is a very, very credible threat and thataposs why weaposve got to continue to be vigilant, weaposve got to continue to work with Ukraine and Poland, as Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, was doing just this week. He warned the loss of le will be horrendousRussian fails to engage in diplomacy. Mr Scully denied that Mr Macron had been more effective in tackling the Ukraine crisis than the Prime Minister, saying Mr Johnson had been on the front foot in addressing the rising tensions. Itaposs important that every member of Nato collaborate and work together, as they are, to make sure that Vladimir Putin realises that he needs to go down the diplomatic route and retreat from the border, he told TALKRadio.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace will take questions in the Commons on Monday afternoon.Russia and ally Belarus said they were extending war games on Belarusian territory that would offer a convenient staging post on Ukrainian capital Kyiv, less than  miles south of the border with Belarus.

Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”.  She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

Dame Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee has said the number of mistakes and opportunities for fraudsters to access Covid support schemes was “unacceptable”. Around £billion of taxpayers money has been lost from schemes and loans launched by the HMRC, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Business Department. But the figure is expected to be much higher as the HM Treasury does not yet know how much money has been lost to fraud and error across the government’s response to COVID-.The furlough scheme alone is estimated to lose £.billion to fraud and error - .% of the funding distributed.  And the National Audit Office Covid  cost tracker reports the Government spent £ billion on  measures in response to the pandemic.The Public Accounts Committee is concerned that HM Treasury does not currently plan to distinguish the cost of COVID- from departments’ business-as-usual spending in future. Committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: Lack of preparedness and planning, combined with weaknesses in existing systems across Government, have led to an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters which will all end up robbing current and future taxpayers of billions of pounds.  “It is essential that for as long as we will be paying the costs of Covid, which is at least the next  years just in some of the loan repayment terms, the Treasury and all of Government continue to account specically for what it has spent in response to the pandemic. Government must be held accountable in this way to all the future taxpayers who will be paying for this response.Crucially this must ensure lessons are learned for when the next big crisis hits - be it climate, health or financial.” Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously denied ignoring fraudulently claimed Covid support funds worth billions of pounds. Mr Sunak said the UK government would do everything we can to recover loans stolen by fraudsters. And last month a Tory minister resigned over the governmentaposs woeful efforts to stop abuse of pandemic support schemes. Covid measures created in response to the pandemic are expected to cost a total of £ billion over their letime – up to  years in the repayment term of the Bounce Back Loan Schemeand typically  years in the Cultural Recovery Fund. The PACAC said in its report: “As the UK recovers from the pandemic it is more vital than ever that government maintains accountability for public money and transparency over what is being spent”.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

The three oligarchs - who Mr Johnson described as very close to the Putin regime” and cronies of the Russian President - are Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and his brother Igor Rotenberg. Boris Johnson told Parliament: Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them.But what do the sanctions mean for the UK  Here is all you need to know. Are British troops going to be sent to Ukraine No. One of Vladimir Putin’s excuses for invading is because he fears Ukraine will one day be accepted into NATO. But it is not currently part of the -nation military alliance and therefore is not protected by its Article V clause on collective defence - that an attack on one is an attack on all. Dozens of UK forces had been deployed in Ukraine since  on Operation Orbital - a training mission to help local troops. They withdrew earlier this month as tensions mounted. However, the UK has bolstered troop numbers in Estonia, which is a NATO member and which also feels threatened by Russian aggression.Will petrol and gas prices rise  Almost certainly. While the UK buys just % of its gas from Russia, Britain is exposed to price volatility on the international market. If Moscow restricts supply, countries which buy Russia’s gas will have to look where - pushing up prices for everyone. Oil prices usually climb when there is any global tension. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude - the world benchmark - hit nearly  yesterday, which could soon hike pump prices for British motorists. Experts warned unleaded could reach £. a litre. Boris Johnson told MPs: “One of the risks of Putin’s venture is there could be a spike in gas prices, in oil prices.”  What are these sanctions  The PM announced sanctions against five Russian banks and three iniduals described as Putin allies. The banks are: Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, IS Bank, Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction and General Bank. Three billionaire oligarchs were also hit: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg, and Igor Rotenberg. The PM told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them.” Is that it A Western official admitted it was “a relatively small but very high value number of Russian oligarchs”. They stressed more sanctions could follow, adding there was a “clear declaration of intent to go further as Russia makes any further incursion into Ukraine”. Russian MPs in the Duma who voted to recognise the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk also face being sanctioned. The PM insisted of the sanctions announced: “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do. We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.”What about Roman Abramovich  Not for the first time, Boris Johnson got his facts wrong and sowed confusion when addressing MPs by incorrectly claiming that Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich was facing sanctions. The PM’s spokesman later admitted Mr Johnson misspoke. An official indicated No is expected to correct the record. It is thought the PM became confused over issues the oligarch had around his entrepreneurial visa in . Last October, the businessmanaposs spokesman confirmed he travelled to London as an Israeli citizen - entering the United Kingdom without the need for a visa.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

But when her hubby Scott tried to wake her up the following morning, she remained unconscious. Telling their story on Stephaposs Packed Lunch, Scott recalled: She was getting more and more lethargic and she went to bed the night before Father’s Day and in the morning I couldn’t wake her up. The terried husband called an ambulance and Claire was rushed to the Royal London Hospital. Once she arrived, she had several seizures and was put on a ventilator for a week. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Claire, a freelance journalist, was put into an induced coma in the hope her body would start to heal - and thankfully, she woke up  days later. But although she was conscious, the mum wasnapost the same - and couldnapost remember the most basic facts about her own le. Claire, from Braintree in Essex, said: I could remember the faces of my family but I was asking about our cats - one of which had been put to sleep a couple of weeks earlier and another three years before. Although she recognised Scott, she couldnapost remember his proposal, their wedding day or the birth of their children. “I couldn’t remember holidays or anything like that. I couldn’t remember  , Covid or lockdown, she said.  Although the mum joked that fortunately sheaposd forgotten about homeschooling the kids. Scott recalled the horror of seeing his we in a coma - with no idea of what was wrong with her. Initially I thought she had suffered a stroke and when they first took her into hospital they thought it was a bleed to the brain but that was ruled out, he said. For the first week they didn’t know what was going on. Eventually Claire was diagnosed with a virus called encephalitis that had attacked her brain - and Scott was relieved when his we woke up. However, he described the heartbreak of realising she couldnapost remember the last  years of her le.  He said: She was talking about dead family members in the present tense and I had to break the news they weren’t alive. I had to sit down and tell her who had died and she grieved a second time. The most important thing is having her around and we are trying to make new memories, by watching films and looking and pictures to seememories ping back or so she can relive it again. Recalling the moment she opened her eyes, Claire said she was hallucinating - and even began telling people Phil Collins was her cousin. She also thought the ceiling above her hospital bed was infested with wasps. Claire has spent the last year in recovery at home with Scott and the boys, but her memory is still in tatters. I can myself in photographs but have no memory of ever being there, she explained, adding that people often ask hershe can remember them. She said her neurologist has told her she should have been able to remember things by now - but the memories havenapost come. It’s really made me focus on the future andI can’t get memories back I will make new ones, she said.Have you ever suffered from encephalitis  Send your stories to jessica.taylor@reachplcClaire also has a tough time with her short term memory and has had to give up driving as she recovers from encephalitis.She said: “Its just as serious as meningitis but people don’t know about it.”Despite having their lives turned upside down, Claire and Scott try to see the funny side - with Scott joking heaposll wrap up Claireaposs expensive handbags and re-gt them to her to look like the best husband in the world.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Kate Middleton will join in outdoor activities with the youngsters who are taught part of the year in the open air on the outskirts of Copenhagen. She took on the challenge of splitting a log after watching five-year-olds complete the task on the second day of her Denmark tour. Surrounded by children dressed in outdoor onesies, teaching assistant Carla Bro, , told Kate to spread her legs and grip the hammer, and laughing she struck the wood. Kate took just three blows to split the log and was applauded for her efforts by Ms Bro who said afterwards: She was very good, she had the right stance with both hands.“She asked how we deal with risky play and how we keep things safe. We have safety rules and we teach the children they should not be afraid of tasks but treat them with respect.”The Duchess embraced the outdoors dressed for the bitterly cold but sunny conditions in boots, jeans, a polo-neck jumper and jacket. On her first day visiting babies in Copenhagen, Kate said she is broody and joked that Prince William worries about her working with under-ones because she comes home saying letaposs have another one. Prince Louis is the youngest of their royal brood and is set to turn four in April, followed by six-year-old Princess Charlotte and eight-year-old Prince George. The latest addition to the family is their pet dog, an adorable cocker spaniel bred by Kateaposs brother James Middleton.  Kate is on a fact finding visit to Denmark to better understand their world leading approach to the early years development of children. The duchess knelt down to meet the five and six-year-olds when she first arrived at Stenurten, a combined nursery and kindergarten in Copenhagen, and one little boy made her smile when he shouted out hello Kate. When one youngster stepped up to split a log Kate told him you’re so strong as he whacked the wood and she clapped with he let out a sigh of relief when it finally split. At the kindergarten, Kate will learn about the Danish use of nature in educating young children which is widely recognised as having huge benefits for their mental health and wellbeing and is something Kate has championed through her own work.  Kate joined other activities and went on a brief woodland walk with a wing buddy where a youngster pairs up with an older child to gain comfort and support. She held the hand of a little girl who also held the hand of Maibritt Iverson, head of Stenurten, and the trio followed pairs of children as they ran into the wooded area and emerged a few minutes later. At the end of the event a mindfulness session was held to relax the children and the duchess sat with them in a circle around a fire covered by a wood canopy as everyone stared into the flames. On Tuesday, the Duchess was seen giggling as she zoomed down a slide at the LEGO Foundation PlayLab during her solo trip.Her two-day visit is also paying tribute to the historic ties Britain shares with Denmark and celebrates the countriesapos joint jubilees.  This includes the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee and the Golden Jubilee of Denmarkaposs Queen Margrethe II, both of which fall in . Denmarkaposs monarch will greet her guest later along with her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Mary of Denmark at Christian IXaposs Palace in Copenhagen later. Kate and Mary, who have met a number of times in the UK and Denmark, will also visit the Danner Crisis Centre. The shelter helps women and children who have been exposed to domestic violence which is supported by the Mary Foundation, founded by the Crown Princess in . On her first day of her Danish tour, Kate met health visitors and new parents to highlight the importance of childrenaposs social development.  She discussed the universal struggle of parenthood where even the most well-educated can find it dficult to ask for support and praised fathers for taking time off work to spend with their babies. The Duchess visited Denmarkaposs Children’s Museum in Frederiksberg to learn about the “Understanding Your Baby Project” and spoke about the social and emotional development of young children. She met two baby boys, both aged eight months, and joked it makes me very broody. The Duchess sat at the table of a small art studio with two couples and first-time parents who came with their eight-month-old babies Svend and Aksel. “William always worries about me meeting under one-year-olds. I come home saying ‘let’s have another one’,” she added.The Duchess learnt about the Danish system of continued care for families from pregnancy.She also told how even well-educated mums and dads struggle with feeling insecure about their parenting.

Churchwarden Chris Daniel said it is a miracle when the clock apparently fixed itself, after quotes to repair it reached up to £,.He added: I do not know why or how the clock has started working again. It is either ine intervention or there is a much more mundane reason that none of us are aware of. We just cannot explain it. Not only is the mechanism working again, but the clock tells the correct time on all the faces. Councillors had been aposticked offapos by the faulty clock which was stuck at just after twelve oaposclock for more than a year. Cllr Tim Mickleburgh, of North East Lincolnshire Council, had called for urgent repairs to stop people visiting the town and leaving with a negative view.  Meanwhile church leaders came under criticism over the broken clock which was recently run for a few minutes as part of an investigation to cost the repairs. Cllr Mickleburgh had described it as a bad example while speaking at a tourism and visitor economy scrutiny  meeting. He said: A lot of money has been spent around St Jamesapos Square but the clock still isnapost working.  When people come from all over, such as when they did for the memorial service for Austin Mitchell, it doesnapost look goodthe clock isnapost working. Former director of music Steven Maxson featured on Jeremy Vine Radio Two programme to explain the costs of repair which he estimated at £,. He said a major fundraising effort would need to be undertaken in order to meet the cost of repairs which would likely involve scaffolding to gain access to the clock.  But Mr Daniel told Grimsby Live there were a number of quotes obtained by the church to get repairs, ranging from £, to £,. One of them had been submitted by the firm which has carried out the restoration work at Big Ben at the Houses of Parliament. He said a Suffolk-based horologist made contact with Minster officials and said he would investigate the fault and submit a quote.  But he told the warden that would not be until later in the year. The mystery deepened when it was explained that there is only one key for the clock tower which is kept at the Minster office. It has not been given to anyone in the past few weeks. Any attempt at repairs would mean taking specialist equipment up the tower and permission would be needed. Staff at the Minster cafe said they were unaware of any repairs having been carried out and hoped more visitors would attend to discuss the issue over refreshments between Tuesday and Saturday. The church warden said further investigations will be undertaken.

Dramatic CCTV footage showed him then jabbing food in the ready meal section of stores with a syringe during the evening of August  last year. He also threw a syringe at a doctor, but it luckily caused no injuries. Police were alerted at around .pm after a man was reported to be throwing blood-filled syringes and eggs in the three supermarkets. The three supermarkets involved - Sainsburyaposs Local, Tesco Express and Little Waitrose - had to throw away all their products as a precaution, causing nearly £, in losses. Elghareeb denies three counts of contaminating goods and two counts of assault.  It is agreed he carried out the acts, but the defence argues that he was in the legal sense, insane at the time. Prosecutor Philip Stott told the court: “In short what happened is this: in the early evening of a late summeraposs day last year, Mr Elghareeb walked down the Fulham Palace Road in West London carrying a bucket. It was filled with syringes, some of which had hypodermic needles attached. A number of those syringes were filled with blood - his own. Mr Elghareeb then entered, in turn, three supermarkets on the Fulham Palace Road - in order: they were Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs and Tesco - and he proceeded to stick those syringes in food products inside those branches of those supermarkets. “Along the way he also threw some of the syringes at people inside and outside the store including hitting a passerby on the street.”  Elghareeb is accused of assaulting Dr Meghana Kulkarni by throwing a needle at her and pushing security guard Bilal Ansari in the chest while shouting: You are all vile people and Sainsburyaposs is vile. Dr Bradley Hillier, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, told the court Elghareeb was severely psychotic at the time and could not appreciate that his actions were legally and morally wrong. He said: He was not thinking straight. He was in a situation where he was trying to escape this worth that the psychosis had created for him.  He was so burdened and tortured, is the word he used. Elghareeb, of Crabtree Lane, Fulham, denies three counts of contaminating goods and two counts of assault by reason of insanity.

Footage of the rescue was captured by another motorist named Jen Mahony on a motorway near Leeds, after the drivers found themselves in the middle of a blizzard. The video shows four men working together to push a stranded car along the road, managing to get it moving despite the poor driving conditions.Heavy snow hit the area from am until pm, affecting public transport and roads, Leeds Live reported. The Met Office subsequently issued a yellow weather warning, stretching across Yorkshire.The Met Office said: A short period of heavy snow may cause some temporary disruption on roads, mainly across higher ground such as the Peak District.  Rain may turn to heavy snow in a few places later this morning and early this afternoon. This is most likely on roads above  metres elevation, such as across the Peak District, but also a lower likelihood to some lower elevations in Yorkshire. Some places could see - cm of slushy snow which could build up quite quickly, before conditions ease from the west this afternoon.Many cars were left stranded by the conditions described, which is why the menaposs bravery and help was sorely needed.One of the men was only wearing a t-shirt as they pushed cars down the street, helping several people get home or to the shops amidst the weather.The minor snowstorm came in the aftermath of Storm Eunice, which was quickly followed by Storm Franklin. Both storms led to widespread floods around the city too. The snowstorm dissipated into sleet showers over the weekend, but the driving conditions were still quite poor.

It is said to be in an almost pristine condition despite dating back around  million yearsResearchers carry part of the fossil Image: via REUTERSByEllie Forbes:,  Feb |comments Remains of the world’s biggest flying reptile from the Jurassic-era were unearthed on the Isle of Skye.A fossilised skeleton of the winged creature is said to be in an ‘almost pristine condition’ - despite the pterodactyl dating back around  million years. The creature, which is said to have had a wingspan of . metres and been the size of an albatross, has been given the Gaelic name Dearc sgiathanach, which translates as ‘winged reptile’.It was found at Brother’s Point, the same stretch headland on Skye’s Trotternish peninsula where fossilised dinosaur footprints made around  million years ago were discovered. The huge flying reptile is the latest in a series of signicant palaeontological finds in recent years on what has become known as ‘Scotland’s Jurassic island’. The discovery was made in  by Amelia Penny, a PHD student at the University of Edinburgh, while she was on a field trip. Scientists hailed the ‘unique specimen’ as the best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur - the world’s first flying animals, which appeared on Earth around  million years before birds. Professor Steve Brusatte, a leading palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, led the  field trip and has been an adviser on the new Jurassic World blockbuster. He worked with director Colin Trevorrow and designers on the film, which will widely feature pterosaurs.  Prof Brusatte said: “This is a superlative Scottish fossil. “The preservation is amazing, far beyond any pterosaur ever found in Scotland and probably the best British skeleton found since the days of Mary Anning in the early s. “Dearc is the biggest pterosaur we know from the Jurassic period and that tells us that pterosaurs got larger much earlier than we thought, long before the Cretaceous period when they were competing with birds, and that’s hugely signicant.” Ms Penny was said to have spotted a fossilised jaw protruding from a limestone layer on a tidal . After the head of pterosaur was identied, a team led by Dugald Ross, founder of the nearby Staffin Museum carried out a painstaking operation, using diamond-tipped saws, to extract the fossil.  Natalia Jagielska, one of the researchers aiming to find out more about the Dearc’s behaviour, said: “To achieve flight, pterosaurs had hollow bones with thin bone walls, making their remains incredibly fragile and unfit to preserving for millions of years. “And yet our skeleton remains in almost pristine condition, articulated and almost complete, its sharp fish-snatching teeth still retaining a shiny enamel cover ashe were alive mere weeks ago.” Dr Nick Fraser, keeper of natural sciences at the National Museum, said: “Even in the context of the amazing palaeontological finds on Skye in recent years, this one really is remarkable. “To find and describe a specimen which is both so well-preserved and so signicant is really special and we’re delighted to add Dearc into our collection.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of EdinburghJurassic WorldDinosaursMuseumsDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Georgia, who lives in Halax, West Yorkshire, with her nurse mum, Katie, , football coach dad, Richard, , and sister Rebecca, , said: “I was leaning on a table when I realised my right side felt a bit uncomfortable and when I looked to see why, I saw the tiniest little bump. “It only felt sore and looked red, so I looked to seeanything had irritated it and showed it to my mum, who is a nurse. “We thought we’d keep an eye on it, but then it started to grow so fast it was five times bigger in just two months, so we went to see the doctor.”  The GP suspected the lump had resulted from damaging the bone in the area and asked Georgiashe had done anything that could have injured one of her ribs. The only thing she could come up with that could cause such an injury was her ice skating. She said: “The only thing I could think of was ice skating, because I was going every Saturday. I skated with my friends, but I’d also been on a rollercoaster, so wonderedthat had caused some damage without me realising it.” Told by the doctor to come backthe pain worsened, two months later - a few weeks before her th birthday - she ed and was sent to the hospital in Huddersfield for tests and scans. When her results looked fine, she settled into revising for her upcoming GCSEs and booked into an adventure programme as a treat when her exams finished. But when she prepared to take part in the National Citizen Serviceprogramme in the summer of  she realised something was very wrong.  She said: “I was trying to put a safety harness on to do one of the activities and I couldn’t because the lump was just too big and it was too painful. “It was now the size of an orange. I knew that wasn’t right and that it wasn’t getting better on its own. Following the negative results from the hospital, when she saw her GP once more, they were concerned in case Georgia had broken a rib. But she had no memory of any injury that could have caused such a dramatic lump. Worried, her mum asked a doctor colleague who is a bone specialist to take a look at Georgia, who had started college and is studying for A Levels in law, criminology and health and social care. By the end of that same day the teenager and her family were given the devastating news that the lump was in fact a tumour. Georgia said: “My mum came to find me in the hospital and said, aposI think we’d better go home.apos I knew she should have been working until later that evening, so I asked her to tell me there and then what the doctor had said. “She told me he thought it was tumour. I burst into tears. I didn’t know what that meant.”  Sent for more scans at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, soon they had a complete picture. She said: “I remember being with my mum and my granddad in the waiting room and watching people walking down the corridor. You can tell who had been given good news and who must have been given bad news, because you could see they were really upset. “We went into a room to get the results of the biopsy and the first thing I saw was that the nurse was wearing a lanyard that said ‘Macmillan Nurse.’ The doctor then told us they were  per cent sure my lump was cancer.” According to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity, every day in the UK seven young people aged between  and  are told they have cancer. And for most, like Georgia, because they are so young, the diagnosis comes as a complete shock, because the thought of having cancer has never crossed their minds. She said: “I asked the doctors, aposAm I going to die apos I was in tears and just asked, aposIs it bad apos” The doctors told Georgia and her family they could not confirm anything until she had a biopsy. And in January  - nearly a year since she first discovered the small red lump on her right ribcage - she was told she had a grade two to three osteosarcoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that make up bone. On January  , she started seven cycles of chemotherapy, which was followed by major and painful surgery in May  to remove the tumour. Then, at the end of July, she was scheduled to have seven further rounds of chemo, but stopped after five, as her body could not tolerate any more. “I tried to keep up my college work, but the chemotherapy made me too tired and the second lot was even worse than the first, so I had to stop,” she said. After spending most of the  lockdowns in treatment, Georgia is now cancer-free. She has a scan every two months to monitor her condition, but says that while her outlook is good, she continues to worry in case the cancer s.  She said: “It is a constant in my le, so however much I’d like it to go away, it is always there and I think about it every day. After ing to college in September  and restarting her A level course, she now plans to train as a specialist cancer nurse, so that she can eventually help people in the same way she was helped through her own treatment. “The Teenage Cancer Trust and the doctors and nurses all supported me and my family. I now want to train so I can give something back,” she said. Recognising that her own experience and fears that her cancer couldhave changed her le for good, she is determined to make the most of every opportunity. She said: “I have learned you only get one shot at le, so now I’ll go for opportunities that I would have been too scared to try for before. “For example, I recently got a job at McDonalds which doesn’t sound like a lot, but I never thought I’d have the courage to go for something like that. Before I had cancer, I’d have been too nervous. “It is still dficult talking about how hard it is to go through cancer, especially as a young person, but I’ve met some amazing people because of it who will be friends for le.And I would say to any other young person who is diagnosed with cancer. aposYes, itaposs scary, but there is so much fantastic support out there for you and your family and they will help you through this. “Also,you are worried, then remember you know your body better than anyone , soyou have a feeling something is wrong, ask for help and don’t stop until you get it. According to the Teenage Cancer Trust - the UK’s only charity dedicated to providing specialist medical care and support to younger people who have been diagnosed with cancer - these are the seven common signs of cancer in - year olds.Lumps Bumps Swellings Unexplained tiredness Persistent pain Serious weight loss Mole changesNone of these symptoms mean you definitely have cancer, but it is important to get checked.For more information on the work of the Teenage Cancer Trust visit: www.teenagecancertrust.org signs or check out the charity’s social media s.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsTeenagersCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Praising fathers for taking time off work to “get to know” their babies, she spoke of the universal struggle of parenthood where even the most well-educated can struggle to ask for help. During a visit to Børnemuseet, the Children’s Museum in Frederiksberg, Denmark, to hear about the “Understanding Your Baby Project”, the Duchess said there should be just as much discussion about the social and emotional development of young children as their physical milestones.  After meeting with two eight-month-old baby boys and their parents, she joked: “It makes me very broody. “William always worries about me meeting under one-year-olds. I come home saying ‘let’s have another one’.”The Duchess spent time with three Danish health visitors, who told her about their system of continued care for families from pregnancy.They visit seven times in the first year, and have all been trained to teach parents how to boost their baby’s social development through eye contact, chatting and play. “Do you feel there is an awareness of social and emotional development  the Duchess asked, adding that in her experience: “There is a lot of talk about feeding and nutrition and physical milestones, but less on the emotional and social milestones.”  Told how even well-educated mothers and fathers struggle with feeling “insecure” about their parenting, she agreed: “[There is] The expectation that maybe they should know already. “Whereas some of the more disadvantaged families probably have dferent challenges  “Do you feel there is a challenge for poorer communities and disadvantaged families, of having to concentrate on primary needs  If they are struggling with meeting primary needs [ like providing food and clothes] do they have time to focus on social and emotional development ” In a small art studio, the Duchess sat around a table with two couples, each first-time parents, and their nearly-nine-month-old babies Svend and Aksel.  The Duchess asked them about their experiences of the Danish health visitor system, observing: “From what I’ve heard about health visiting here it seems really extraordinary. “This focus on emotional and social development, looking holistically. It’s a highly-regarded profession.” Asking whether they felt confident asking for helpthey were struggling, or whether there was a “stigma”, she heard how important it was for parents to know that their trusted health visitor was giving advice based on research. “To have first-hand advice based on research, founded in science, must be really good,” she replied.  Commenting on a tendency to look online for answers but not be able to trust the results, she agreed: “It’s a wealth of knowledge but you don’t always know where it’s come from.” Hearing about how the Danish system trains health visitors to speak to new parents in a non-intimidating way about how to boost their children’s well-being, she asked the fathers whether it helped provide them “with a common language” to discuss emotions with their friends. “As fathers, do you feel part of this conversation ” she asked. “Particularly the age your kiddies are, often people’s focus is on the mother. Do you feel the health visitors bring you into the role as well ” Told that yes, many Danish fathers took parental leave, she added: “It’s so nice! You get to know him [your baby].”  The “Understanding Your Baby Project” is a universal educational parenting programme teaching health visitors to have more helpful and sensitive conversations with parents. In Denmark, all children have seven “preventative health examinations” with their GP before they start school. They will have an average five or six home appointments with a health visitor before the age of one, and there are around , health visitors for a population of .million. In the UK, there are five mandated checks for children before the age of ., with some taking the form of a questionnaire for parents to fill out. There are , health visitors in England for a population of .million.

Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich bought a £million house there in Eaton Square is also known as Red Square by Russian residents in London Image: ANDY RAIN EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByTom ParrySpecial correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Built by the landowning Grosvenor family, and named after Eaton Hall, their Cheshire country house, the history of London’s Eaton Square could not be more English. In the heart of well-heeled Belgravia, the five-storey Georgian townhouses that look out on six manicured private parks are among Britain’s most desirable addresses. But many residents are not UK taxpayers, and are more likely to be billionaire Russian oligarchs with some having had past relationships with Vladimir Putin.Eaton Square has been nicknamed Red Square due to the amount of Russian-owned property there. Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, who has a £billion fortune, bought a £million house there in  – one of several mansions he owns in London. Another oligarch with property on the square is aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska, believed to have a £bn fortune. He is said to be close to Putin, and claims have been made that he is the premier’s “favourite industrialist”.  Many Russians have invested large amounts in London amid rumours of some Russian money being circulated through untraceable shell companies registered in tax havens. A Transparency International probe identied property worth a total of at least £bn bought in posh London areas using suspect funds from Russia. There is no suggestion of anyone named using suspect funds.  Others with properties in the capital include Arsenal’s former largest shareholder Alisher Usmanov, whose wealth came from metal and mining. He owns -acre Beechwood House in Highgate, North London. Billionaire Eugene Shvidler is thought to live in Belgravia. London-based oligarchs are among the .% of Russians who own more of their country’s wealth than the bottom .%. Many of Russia’s  million people live in poverty and as the President has no genuine competition in elections he can afford to focus more on the .%.  Investigative journalist Oliver Bullough, who has been involved in bus tours of the oligarchs’ mansions, wrote: “No one has done more to channel the flood of money out of Russia than London’s army of lawyers, bankers and accountants no one has been more accommodating of Putin’s oligarchs than Britain’s politicians and, as a result, no one is more to blame than us for the fact Russia’s richest can treat war like a spectator sport.” Critics say the Government must do more to stop some oligarchs hiding money here, as they could provide a financial war chest for Putin. By siphoning money into London property, Russians can disguise the origins of their money.After the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergie Skripal in Salisbury in , former PM Theresa May introduced a crackdown. But in , Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee Russia Report called Russian influence in the UK “the new normal”.Russian-born donors or iniduals with business links to Russia have given nearly £m to the Tory party or constituency associations since Boris Johnson took power in July , Electoral Commission figures show.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for new anti-corruption measures, writing recently: “Over almost  years of Tory government, the creeping tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap themselves around the UK.”Seven hundred wealthy Russians were among those allowed to enter the UK on Tier  investor visas between  and  infor £m, a period when no state checks were carried out. The Home Office is reviewing all visas granted during that period. If Putin does invade Ukraine, some oligarchs in Belgravia could see their assets frozen. For now, however, London remains the city of choice for many who benefited from the Soviet Union’s break-up.

Dale Saint Cullen, , has spent the last five years chase a certain look, and says social media brainwashed him into chasing this  reality. He is now telling his story to raise awareness of the impact of social media has on peopleaposs self-esteem. He said: On social media, I never noticed at the time, but I was looking at these people who looked perfect and I fell into this vicious cycle of chasing what was not the reality, it was completely .I was flying out to Poland and Turkey and showing surgeons filtered pictures on Instagram of how I wanted to look.It took me a while to realise thataposs not what they actually look like in real le.  Dale said he has realised that he will never achieve the look that he wanted, and he now advocates for people to love themselves inside and out. He is hoping to warn others to not fall into the same trap.He said: Iaposm -years-old now and it seems like people on social media are getting younger and younger and I worry about the affect it has on them. When you see all these reality TV stars ad influencers and they look perfect it can be really damaging to young people. Dale said that when celebrities encourage surgery or tell people to buy these products to get the perfect Hollywood smile, it has a profound effect on their self-esteem. He adds: I think I was trying to fit in with society. I was fine during school. It wasnapost until social media came about, thataposs when I first started thinking about getting work done.  Dale initially only wanted to get a nose job, but has described surgery as a slippery slope. Social media led him to want surgery on his chin, have better teeth, bigger lips, and a sharper jaw. He said: Its like thereaposs always a new trend and I just couldnapost keep up. Iaposm all for following the trend but not when it means you have to change your entire face. Dale doesnapost regret the work heaposs had done, only the reasons behind it. He will also be doing another surgery in June.  He is encouraging people to make sure theyaposre getting surgery for the right reasons -thataposs what they want to do. He said: I spent so much time, money, and energy on chasing that perfect look, itaposs crazy. I would just say to people to make sure you do your research first and make sure youaposre doing it for the right reasons. Iaposm seeing a therapist to try and make sure I work on myself. The work I had done in the past, it wasnapost for me, I did it under the pressures of social media. Iaposm in a much better place now and I make sure everything I do is for me. Dale has also warned that getting cosmetic surgery can make you feel worse rather than helping with any issue you think you may have. I really want to show other young people that chasing a look like that isnapost possible and it can leave you feeling worse than you did beforehand, he explained. He adds that there are some days where he wakes up and feels more self-conscious now than he did before the surgery.

Amy Robinson has only been able to watch as her family home is blighted by mould.Now, a council workman told her that the reason she, her husband and two children are living in such terrible conditions is because of hair dryer use, HullLive reported.The -year-old’s situation has deteriorated so badly that she bought her own damp reader to highlight just how awful things have gotten.The East Yorkshire mum has previously spoken out about the damp problem in her home which affects most rooms.She claimed a council inspector also previously told her to stop drying her washing to solve the problem. Damp problems have plagued the house since around when the family moved in, a few years ago.  She said: We moved in about three years ago and had a few months of no problems before it then started. So, I told the council and they sent an inspector out to come and have a look. “He came out and had a look and said I needed to stop drying my washing in my house and I need to vent my place. Amy claimed that the damp is often in places where the clothes aren’t dried and that windows were open most of the time. Tile vents were installed last summer to fix an apparent leak from the roof, but Amy said the problem in the house has continued since. The damp and mould has spread from walls and ceilings onto furniture as well. A sofa, table, chest of draws, blinds and a mirror had all been affected. Iaposve already had to redecorate three or four times, Amy said.

Another recent visit by a council inspector identied what was reportedly viewed as a little damp patch but saw emphasis again on ventilation. This was before a follow-up visit by a roofer where Amy says she was told not to use her hair dryer. Someone came out and said there isnapost any problems, itaposs due to me drying my hair in my bedroom as when they came in my mum had the hairdryer on in my bedroom, Amy said. My dad was trying not to laugh or say anything to him as he kept saying itaposs my fault and condensation. Yet a recent damp reader bought by Amy herself has highlighted the apparent signicant levels of dampness on the walls in most of the houseaposs rooms. All rooms are reportedly affected by the damp, except for the kitchen and currently the bathroom. Most of the readings taken by Amy and photographed showed a damp level of more than  per cent and in two cases, over  per cent.The normal moisture level in a wall ies, dependent upon the material used, but usually dampness above  per cent is viewed as cause for concern. When Amy originally spoke to Hull Live, an East Riding of Yorkshire Council spokesman said: A further inspection will shortly take place at the property and the councilaposs housing team are committed to resolving any issues which fall under the councilaposs responsibilities. Amyaposs ideal scenario is for the repairs needed to fix the damp and mould to be made so the family can stay at the property, though the family are considering whether to move.

Maisie, who is in year one, had managed to leave the school grounds during the lunch break and made her way to her mumaposs place of work in Batley, West Yorkshire. Luckily she was unhurt in the incident but Talor said it could have been much worse. The mum has now pulled her child out of the school, as she no longer trusts them to look after her daughter.  She said: She was in the school playing and having her lunch, then managed to leave the school grounds and head into Batley without any of the teachers realising she was missing. I was at work at the supermarket and turned round and my daughter was there. I took her back to school to find out what was going on and they didnapost know she had gone. Itaposs disgusting to have allowed that to happen. Sheaposs only five years old. It was very lucky that I was in a place that she has visited before. It could have been a very dferent situation. Itaposs a very busy town. I have now taken my daughter out of that school. I told them that they are not to be trusted.  Philip Sunter, headteacher at Maisie’s former school, Batley Parish Junior, Infant and Nursery School, said it had launched a probe into the incident that took place on Tuesday th February. He added: The safety of all of our pupils is always our number one priority and we are thoroughly investigating how this was able to happen. We offer our deepest apologies to the parents of this pupil. I would like to reassure all parents that this is an isolated incident and something we are taking incredibly seriously.

Some months Iaposm OK and I manage and I get by. But other months I find it really dficult, she told YorkshireLive. One month I was unable to get bread, milk, the basic things we all take for granted. My mental health has really really struggled. I wait two weeks for the money to come in, and then often find thereaposs so many things I need to get it ends up gone and Iaposm back to square one. Itaposs a vicious circle.  I donapost really bother about me but I constantly worry about whether I can keep the kids alright. Rebecca looks after her two children, aged nine and , as well as her niece, , due to her sister recently having a stroke. She started off working  hours a week at the Premier Inn in August , before moving to do more hours a week at a coffee shop. But Rebecca said that she found herself struggling increasingly while working on Universal Credit - and sometimes didnapost have enough left to buy milk or bread. Rebecca estimated that after rent she had £ or £ a month left when she was working for her family. I felt like I was getting penalised because I was working. It seemed like everything I made was taken straight off me, she said. I felt much better mentally and able to manage before I started working. I had to organise child care on my own and start paying full council tax. I was getting myself in such a state and I wasnapost seeing my children because I was always at work. I couldnapost pick them up from school or anything, I was often too tired to cook too. The Universal Credit taper rate is currently %, meaning that for every £ a claimant earns their allowance is reduced by p. After around a month of struggling at the coffee shop, Rebecca opted to go back to receiving full Universal Credit to help her get by. She now has rent paid and most of her council tax, and estimates that after that she has £, a month left. It has been easier but she still finds it hard to get by. The kids all needed new school shoes the other day, she said. It doesnapost seem like itaposs going to be much, butyou pay £ per pair of shoes for three children - thataposs £ I donapost have. All those everyday essentials - school stuff, snacks - theyaposre really dficult. I feel like I canapost provide for my kids. On really skint weeks we have to go and get boxed foods from Iceland and Heron Foods. I have a huge fear of running out of the things I class as urgent like sanitary towels, cleaning products, hygiene items. Sometimes women canapost afford to buy all these things and itaposs very degrading. I canapost afford carpets in our property. Recently my son tripped over and got a huge splinter in his foot and I had to take him to the hospital to get it sorted. The nurse made a joke about us needing to get carpets in the house and I felt so judged. I had to contact a charity just to get us a taxi back from the hospital because I didnapost have the money. All these little things mount up. The rising cost of living is another big concern for Rebecca, who is already paying £ a day for her electricity bill in her three-bed maisonette. My energy bills are absolutely extortionate. I donapost have the heating on that much because we canapost afford it. We tend to have it on for an hour in the morning and an hour at tea time, she said. The cost of living rise is really scary. During winter Iaposve already had to say to my kids aposeven though weaposre freezing, we have to turn it offapos because I just canapost afford it. We often canapost afford to go out and do things in the winter so we spend all weekend in our cold house without the heating on. Iaposm constantly watching our meter to make sure we donapost go over.I struggle enough as it is - with the price cap going up in April, I just think we wonapost be able to cope at all. Iaposd like to see Boris Johnson try live on the amount we get. My mum only gets £ a week to live on - I donapost understand how thataposs possible.The stress has left Rebecca really struggling with her mental health. She is currently receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help her cope.

Our local charity Noahaposs Ark said theyaposve heard some people are feeling suicidal. I enjoy going to work and have always been art of a working family, but it started to feel pointless. I do understand why people want to stay on benefits because itaposs so much less stress. People donapost understand how dficult it can be. I think something needs to change. The Universal Credit taper rate was reduced from p to p recently by the Department of Work and Pensions . The DWP states it provides a financial safety net while claimants go back to work. There is also some support for upfront childcare costs through a Flexible Support Fund award. A DWP spokesperson said: “Our changes to Universal Credit are boosting nearly two million working families by £ a year on average, making sure work pays, with our upcoming .% rise in the living wage offering another boost. “We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are taking decisive action through a £ discount on bills this autumn and a £ non-repayable reduction in Council Tax bills through the £bn Energy Bills Rebate.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TaxEnergy billsMental healthChildcare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tia Watson, , who was -weeks pregnant at the time and was left stuck in France due to a miscommunication by the budget airline. She, her partner Martin Beard and their daughter, four, were scheduled to fly to Fuerteventura on Monday, February , before ing to England on Friday, February .However, as the plane attempted to touch down at Manchester Airport on Friday, bad weather conditions led to an aborted landing. The flight was then erted to Bordeaux in the South of France, Nottinghamshire Live reports.The family then waited at Bordeauxaposs airport for nearly three hours before they were told to go to a hotel overnight, paid for by the airline. Tia said: We received a text on Friday night to say, aposWe apologise for your overnight delay, your new flight time will be :pm on Saturday evening local time.apos  As a result, Tia and her family went to sleep and prepared for a leisurely morning as they had nearly  hours until their flight. However, when they arrived at the hotelaposs restaurant for breakfast, Tia said: There was literally no one at the hotel from our flight. She continued: We thought this was really weird because the flight we were on was full and there was hundreds of people in our hotel. Reception then told us that they all got picked up on free coaches this morning. We assumed that everyone  had been told the correct flight and weaposre the only ones that had received the error, she said.  The family then phoned Ryanair to ask about the situation, but were reassured that they were still booked on the :pm flight they had originally been told to board. But, when they got to the airport, there was no such flight on the departures list, and a Ryanair delegate told them that the only flight to England that day left at am, meaning theyaposd missed it. After being on the phone for hours all day, getting to the airport with a four-year-old, Iaposm pregnant myself and obviously itaposs very, very stressful, Tia explained. Then they said thereaposs a flight today , so they wanted us to lug all of our stuff to the airport again, three hours before the flight, go through check-in and everything, on the off-chance that three people donapost show up. Thataposs stressful in itself, she added.  The family were then booked to fly home on Wednesday, February , which would have left them stranded in France for a few more days. Luckily, they managed to get back home late on Sunday, February . Tia said that her partner is a reception teacher and it was a nightmare having to contact the headteacher at the school to let him know about the situation. Additionally, the family were not logistically prepared for the mix-up. Tia said: We were in Fuerteventura so we obviously only packed summer clothes. So, now, weaposre in  degree weather in dresses and sandals with no money, no clothes. If I donapost laugh, I will cry. Yesterday, I was just crying all day, Tia added.

But it can also mean “my little pastry puff, reports My London.Robert Lacey, a royal biographer, appeared to confirm the nickname in an interview with The Sunday Times.

Charles and Camilla are also said to refer to one another by dferent names, calling one another Fred and Gladys. The young royals also have their own nicknames for family members. When it comes to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, itaposs apparent that she goes by a dferent name to the traditional aposgrandmaapos or aposnanny.aposInstead, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis call her aposGagaapos.According to a royal source speaking to the Sun, the nicknames are a way of sometimes cutting through tension around the lack of aposgood communicationapos between one another. The source said: The royals are not very good at communicating with one another so this is one way around it. Nicknames are a way of taking the family tension out of things. “They can also be a rather childlike family. They love to play games and they give each other silly presents. I think it’s because they have to be so earnest in their public lives. “It’s done with affection usually and there are grains of truth about what one feels about another.”Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

It wascaptioned: As Scotland team patron, The Princess Royal often supports the team from the stands.Her Royal Highness and Vice Admiral Sir Tim cheered Scotland on from home today as they played England for the Calcutta Cup,  years since their first match. Well played, Scotland. Scotland beat England - during the opening weekend of the annual tournament. The pair looked quite relaxed watching the game in her cosy living room, which was filled with family photographs, paintings, books and ious trinkets.  Pictures of Princess Zaraaposs  christening as well as photos of her son Peter Phillips as a youngster could be seen around the room, as could numerous books including two large copies of animals. On the walls were several landscape paintings in mismatched frames, all of which appeared to be of ious seaside towns. Two cabinets on the back wall were filled with little ornaments, like porcelain animal figurines, and more framed photos.Many royal fans offered their opinions on the room, as one person said: Thank you HRH but please declutter, that would play havoc with my OCD. Another said: I feel a little claustrophobic just looking at all the stuff in their living room.In a video congratulating those who were involved in the opening of the NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital in Glasgow, we got to see another room in the home.The cream-coloured room features metallic bronze furniture including a large mirror, a cabinet filled with animal ornaments, and four rectangular framed photos hanging on the walls. There are also three side tables behind her - one features a blue and white desk lamp with a large lampshade and three framed photos.  Another below the mirror holds more photo frames and a vase full of light pink roses, and the last directly behind Anne showcases two white photo frames including a photo of Zara and her husband Mike on their wedding day. Zara also lives on the Gatcombe Park estate with Mike along with their daughters Mia, six, and Lena, one.

Body language expert Judi James has said Kate Middleton definitely seemed nervous at ious moments during her overseas tour. Speaking to OK!, the expert said: There are only a couple of gestures that hint at any potential feelings of nerves or any suggestion of anxiety about the current crisis in the royal Firm back home. In one pose, Kate has both hands on the handle of her bag and is holding it in front of her torso in a barrier gesture that makes her look less assured than she does when she is walking with the bag hanging at her side.  And when she sits at the table for her meeting at the university, she is the one in the group sitting with her hands on her lap rather than on the table like the others, giving them the edge in terms of signals of spatial dominance and status. James explained further. She added: It makes her look a little unsure, but then the world of the boardroom is not her natural habitat and hopefully she spread out a little as the meeting went on.  However, despite the ious moments of nervousness, James did note that in many of the photos, Kate showed a keenness and a purpose as she visited the Scandinavian country. The royal has been pictured this week in Copenhagen, visiting the Centre of Early Childhood to learn about Denmarkaposs approach to early childhood development while wearing a white shirt and a red Zara jacket.  James said, on the whole, Kate is stamping her royal profile with a look of calm confidence and charm here as she undertakes her first solo trip abroad since the pandemic kicked in. Although she produces a perfect and often fun-looking double-act with her husband , Kate appears to project higher levels of assertive confidence here by herself, James said. Her outfit looks like an intentional statement of a more brusque, business-like approach and that sentiment is very much echoed in her handshaking techniques. James added that when Kate waves to the crowd and shakes hands with fans, she shows warmth and modesty.

Debbie Organ, , had visited medics constantly for eight weeks with a range of health concerns.Her symptoms began with headaches and low energy while she was on holiday in July last year - which doctors suggested was depression, in the aftermath of family deaths of family members, and medics gave her medicine to improve her mood.A nurse then recommended that Debbie get her vision tested after she experienced dizziness, ringing in her ear and a flickering eyelid. It was during this examination that her optician raised concerns about her eye pressure, and then referred her to a hospital clinic.Debbie later underwent a brain scan, which revealed a low-grade tumour. Within two days she had emergency surgery to remove it. Following the le-saving diagnosis, Debbie is now calling on more people to get their eyes tested regularly. Debbie, a hire desk manager, said her ordeal started after her dad died and she went on holiday in July . During the trip, she suffered from a debilitating headache and a lack of energy. She was due back at work but called in sick and went to see a doctor when she didnapost feel better after taking painkillers for a week. But doctors dismissed it as a low mood after the death of her dad and prescribed her antidepressants. Debbie didn’t take the tablets as she was convinced this was not the right diagnosis and instead continued to chase the doctors for the next eight weeks.  She said: “I was phoning weekly saying I had headaches, no energy, dizziness, ringing in my ear, a flickering eyelid. “A nurse practitioner suggested it could be my eyes and to get them tested.” Debbie then went for a routine eye test at White Rose Optical in her hometown of Wakefield, West Yorks. But as the optician was concerned about the pressure in Debbie’s eye, they then referred her to the hospital’s eye clinic, where she got an MRI scan. Debbie said: “The following week, I went into the mobile scanner at Pinderfields Hospital with my husband waiting outside. “A lovely nurse gave me an eye mask and some headphones, and spoke to me as she could tell I was scared.” After the MRI, Debbie was told she had a brain tumour and needed to be transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for an urgent operation.  She said: “I was shocked. It didn’t sink in. I came out and told my husband and was escorted to AE, my head whirling. “I called my mum and a few close friends and no one could believe it.” Debbie’s husband, gym engineer Mark, , was not allowed to stay with her at the hospital due to Covid rules and just two days later, Debbie was taken down to the hospitalaposs theatre. To her relief, she made it through the nerve-wracking operation. She said: “When I was pushed back to the ward, I can remember putting my thumbs up to my roommate in the hospital saying ‘I made it to the other side’. “She supported me through the week as due to Covid restrictions there were no visitors. “I rang my family and I was in tears, they were so relieved to hear my voice. “After a few days, I was allowed to come home to recover.” Debbie said her husband, mother and a few close friends had been “amazing” throughout the ordeal and had looked after her on the rollercoaster of the recovery journey. She later found out that she had a low-grade tumour known as a meningioma, but was told by the surgeon he was confident that he had removed all of it. Shortly after her diagnosis, Debbie was referred to Yorkshire’s Brain Tumour Charity by her specialist nurse. The tumour will need to be monitored in future, but Debbie is determined to keep doing the things she enjoys. She said: “I might need radiotherapy in the future to stop the tumour from regrowing but I’m here to tell the tale. “My tumour was highly receptive to progesterone so my contraceptive had been feeding it I’ve now stopped taking it.She added: “All I can say is the NHS nurses and surgeons at LGIare amazing!I’d tell everyone, make sure you get your eyes tested regularly, it really can save your le.

People said shed never find a husband because of it, but shes proven them all wrongBeth and her husband have a family of sevenByJulia BanimAudience WriterBeth Kilgallon:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsAfter visiting an orphanage in Ecuador at the age of , Beth Hyde, from Indiana, US, knew exactly what she wanted to do with her le, and, after finishing college, harboured ambitions to work overseas, looking after children in orphanages. However, one day, after attending a church service, Beth decided to go one step further and ring around some fostering agencies.Being just  and single at the time, she was initially knocked back, with many people calling her crazy for even wanting to foster in the first place at such a young age. Unperturbed by those who doubted her, Beth was given her first two foster children Ava and Sadie, when she was just  years old. The girls were two and four at the time, and going from no kids to two proved to be the hardest transition for Beth. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Beth said: I had to try and understand being a mum in general, trauma and their special needs. I felt defeated, I almost gave up and gave them back. But I didnapost give up. Becoming a foster mum was dficult because it felt like I was given a pile of information and then handed a child. It was extremely overwhelming. Some days I felt insane and under-qualied but it has been the best gt because I now have my kids. Ten months later, Beth was asked whether she could also take in a one-month-old baby girl, Nora, leaving her with three foster kids while still in her early twenties. She recalled: She was a perfect baby and it was a smoother transition going from two kids to three. At the beginning of January , I decided I was going to adopt my three foster children. It was at this point that Beth then decided to close her home for a while in order to bond with her three adopted children.By July , her home was reopened once again, at which point she fostered the prematurely born Mia, picking her up from NICU.  Four months later, Noraaposs biological mother had another baby, named Lucy, and requested that Beth take her in because she knew she would be loved. Beth brought Lucy home and eventually ended up adopting both her and Mia, leaving her a single parent of five adopted daughters. Beth, now , said: So I was a single mum of five and people were constantly telling me I would never find a husband because of the kids. Iaposd tried online dating, but nothing worked out. Iaposd pretty much given up hope. However, everything changed when Beth met Marc, , a fellow single parent who interviewed her for a podcast about foster care back in , right at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Beth: We got talking and discovered we had many connections, and we just continued to get to know each other. He had two kids from his previous relationship. Within a month of knowing him, I knew he was going to be the man I would marry. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

Little did she know that things would get heated fast. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the woman explained that it was all kind of awkward but nothing horrible until the third night when she came home from an evening out with pals at around  pm.After heading into her kitchen for a late-night snack, she was astonished to find that nearly all of her food was gone. She wrote: Iaposm not even exaggerating. I swear  per cent of my pantry was just gone. I asked my sister and she told me that she was shocked I ate anything with preservatives and unnatural and that I was apospoisoning my bodyapos so she took it upon herself to throw away everything she deemed unhealthy.Describing the scene as being like someone had robbed my kitchen, she was shaken to find that so much food both packaged and unpackaged had been binned, even things like spices that werenapost fresh.In total, she estimates that nearly  worth of food had been chucked , including dried pasta, ground beef, pre-cut veggies in a container, juice, canned soups, rice, chicken broth, leftovers, and even bread. Unfortunately, her sister showed no guilt or remorse after being confronted, choosing instead to give a lecture on what she regards as disgusting processed foods.  She continued: I demanded that she pay to replace everything, but she dug her heels in and said that she was doing me a favour and that the way I ate was aposdisgustingapos . I know Iaposm biased, but my diet isnapost even crazy. Itaposs pretty much standard food youaposd find at any grocery store. Distressed by the situation, the poster asked her sister to pack up and leave right then and there in the middle of the night, taking a -minute cab ride to their parentsapos house. Sadly, things have been further complicated by their parentaposs reaction, with their mother left devastated by the fall-out. Sheaposs now insisting that the Reddit user be the one to apologise so as to keep the peace, holding out hope that the sister will take the job sheaposs interviewing for and live close to her family again. I told my mom thatshe wanted to lose not one, but both daughters then sheaposd keep pushing me to apologize for something I feel I have a right to be upset about. My dad says that sheaposs been crying every night though, and I love my mom so much I feel like a huge a**hole for being stubborn about the situation. Many of those commenting were sympathetic to the posteraposs plight, reassuring her that she wasnapost being unreasonable given how cheeky her sister had been. One person wrote: This is a hill I would die on. I can’t imagine having to suddenly pay to replace all my food, spices included. Never mind the wastefulness of tossing perfectly good food that could have been donated to a charity pantry. Your parents’ anger is misplaced. Another advised: Stick to your guns and donapost apologize, evenshe pays you back. As you grow older youaposll realize that sometimes Moms cry, and thataposs not your fault sheaposs human and like people have mentioned she probably doesnapost want to rock the boat because she wants her other daughter to stick around. But that doesnapost mean she gets to guilt you into anything. Sisters fight, and your sis was being irrational and disrespected your home and hospitality.Do you have a shocking or interesting family story to tell  We pay for stories.

At am in the early hours of Sunday a resident of the village of Staverton in Northamptonshire was shocked to see a large figure in front of them.For a brief moment their car lights illuminated the creature, highlighting its powerful back legs, Northants Live reported. A second later and the mystery animal was gone.The baffled spotter took to Mumsnet, and, posting under the name GallopingHighRoad, asked what they may have seen.The initial message read: We had been away for a few nights and travelled back quite late.  Towards the end of our journey, this was about am, we were driving along an A Road in a rural area when something crossed the road in front of us in full headlights for about three seconds. It was about the height of a person, maybe ft or over, but had short powerful legs and hips which seemed to move in a circular fluid fashion. It was not a deer because it stood on two legs. This was in the midlands and the area is traditional rolling fields and woodland.In this particular spot there are no houses or buildings, nearest is over a mile away. We drove back today as its only seven miles from home to look at the road layout and whatever it was moved into a wide bowl-shaped field dropping down to a stream. Any ideas The location of the sighting was later confirmed on Google Earth as a layby next to fields on the A, just outside Staverton. Mumsnet swung into action, suggesting many possible resolutions to the mystery including a wild wallaby or roaming bear. It seems likely that the beast may have been a wallaby, given that there have been numerous apparent sightings of the marsupials in Northamptonshire.Back in  a young boy spotted what he thought was a wallaby in Salcey Forest.While not native to the UK, there are several known populations of the animals in the country in areas where theyaposve escaped from captivity. Other more fancul ideas for its identity include the mythical creature of Slenderman or a Sasquatch. In response, Galloping High Road replied: Not a goatman, slenderman, sasquatch. These things donapost exist. Colour - dark brown, but always hard to tell in full beam. The aposthin bearapos is best way to describe it. Droopy shoulders, but wide hips etc at base. But obviously not a bear in UK. They were adamant it was definitely not human and more a mix of goat and deer.

That was until they received a letter from an aposangelapos called Helper, who claims to have been keeping an eye on Sunny in Heaven. The family said: We had to put down our dog. He was . We got this letter from our vet. No words right now. The vets letter reads: Hello. My name is Helper. I am an angel. There are a lot of angels in Heaven and we all have dferent jobs.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. My job is to write to people and let them know that their pets have arrived in Heaven. One of the head angels told me that you were worried about Sunny and asked me to write you about him. Reassuring the family that Sunny made it into Heaven, the angel said he has settled in and is doing just swell. The letter added: I know that he was ill when he was with you. He had gotten very old and when you get old, your body is not as strong as it used to be. Sunny was tired and I think maybe he knew that it was time to come here. And it is a good thing he did because now he is not old anymore and he isnapost sick either. In fact, I saw him just a little while ago and he was running and jumping with some other dogs and having a great time.  Relaying a message from Sunny, the angel told the family just how much their dog has been missing them - but said he wants them to know that he will see them again one day. Sunny misses you and hopes that you understand he had to come here, it continued. I am sure that one day Sunny will be there to greet you when you come here and you will have a grand reunion. Until then, we will keep him busy and happy. Here we donapost have time like you do. It never gets dark. It is just one long day. And everyone here is your friend, so donapost worry. Sunny is not ever going to be lonely. Someday when he sees you again, it will be like you were never apart. Donapost feel sad. Sunny is just fine. He is happy and he sends his love to you. Sharing their thoughts on the letter, which has been shared on Reddit, one user said: Our vet sends sympathy cards signed by all of the staff. Itaposs kind of hard to take, but they know people are hurting.Ask vet staff what the hardest part of their job is, and itaposs putting down a pet who has been part of your le and family day in and day out for many years. In agreement, another veterinary worker added:Sometimes we ask another employee to swap with uswe are too emotional. It doesn’t do anybody any goodyou’re crying louder than the owner. They add up though, and sometimes it just explodes. One of the most memorable experiences for me was this sweet old widow and her friend. They both quietly sobbed while we put down her senior dog. We gave them time alone afterwards with him, and after  minutes, they exited the room and closed the door quietly behind them. I went in to prepare her pet for the next step, and the dog was covered in beautul handpicked field flower bouquets. Maybe they had a little ceremony for him. It brings tears to my eyes every time I think of this, and now whenever I have to euthanise a pet, I try to pick some flowers along the way.Do you have a heartwarming dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditTeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Land Down Under implemented some of the strictest pandemic measures of any democracy back in March .It is the latest in a list of nations that have relaxed their coronavirus rules. Here are some of the countries that have recently changed their travel regulations, as collated by Liverpool Echo.  Australia As of February , , arrivals who are fully vaccinated will not need a travel exemption and will not be made to quarantine. Anyone entering the country is also required to complete an Australia Travel Declaration at least  hours before departure. The ATD includes a declaration regarding your vaccination status and you will be asked to upload your vaccination certicate. Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia - and these will not be granted solely for tourism purposes.Inbound passengers must also provide a negative accepted Covid- test result.Australian states and territories also have their own Covid- rules, with the strictest enforced by Western Australia state which covers a third of the island continent.  Spain Spain introduced a huge change for holidaymakers this week as children over  from non-EU countries, such as the UK, now do not need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus to enter the country. The change came into force on Monday, February , ahead of the school half term. Adults who are fully vaccinated and travelling from the UK can enter Spain without needing to test or quarantine regardless of your reason for travel. The country also has new booster jab requirements which mean thatyou completed your vaccination course over nine months ago, youaposll need a booster jab to be considered fully vaccinated. However, adult Brits yet to receive both jabs can only enter the countrytheir reason for travel falls into one of the categories listed as essential. Morocco  After swtly closing its borders in October, Morocco is now welcoming fully vaccinated tourists again. Passengers must also present a negative PCR result, and download, print and sign a passenger health form before arrival in Morocco. Children under the age of  are exempt from the pre-travel PCR test requirement, and children under the age of  are exempt from the requirement to present a vaccine pass. France Only fully vaccinated Brits can visit for holidays without needing to quarantine. The country has scrapped Covid test requirements so fully vaccinated holidaymakers wonapost need a PCR or antigen test to visit.Unvaccinated travellers need an essential reason to visit. There are also new booster jab requirementsyou were vaccinated over  days ago. All passengers will also need to sign a apossworn statementapos confirming they are not showing symptoms of coronavirus, nor have they been in contact with a confirmed case within  days before travel to France.  Norway Norway’s border is now open as it was before the pandemic began. Most restrictions within the country have also been lted. All travellers arriving in Norway must complete registration prior to arrival. This also applies to Norwegian citizens. Arrivals must also take a test upon entering the country, regardless of their vaccination status. . Greece Greece is open to both vaccinated and unvaccinated Brits. Greece recently updated its rules so that fully vaccinated travellers will be exempt from Covid test requirements. Anyone over the age of  will need to fill out a pre-departure passenger locator form. If youaposre unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, you will need to show proof of a negative Covid test result. PCR tests can be taken within  hours of arrival, or antigen tests within  hours of arrival. Israel Israel will now allow unvaccinated tourists to enter from the beginning of next month. Its government announced the rule change on Sunday as the latest wave of the coronavirus recedes. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that foreign tourists, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, would be required to take PCR coronavirus tests before their flights and upon landing. The rules go into effect on March .

In First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait, published in , he writes: “There were hordes of rats in the front entryway. My friends and I used to chase them around with sticks. ”Once I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner. It had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing me.“Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose. There, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered.” The anecdote may be part of his carefully curated narrative, but it gives us a glimpse into the making of the man who now has the world holding its breath. Putin was born on October , , in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, a city that had been under siege for  days in the Second World War. More than a million people had died of starvation, many families entirely wiped out. In the war, Putin’s father, Vladimir, was away fighting, while his mother, Maria, almost starved to death. Putin writes: “Once my mother fainted from hunger. People thought she had died, and they laid her out with the corpses. Luckily Mama woke up in time and started moaning.” His father was one of only four of the  men in his unit to come home from the war, and for the rest of his le limped because of shrapnel injuries.The couple are believed to have lost their two older children, one to diphtheria during the war, the second from another childhood illness. Vladimir Putin was a “miracle baby” who arrived late. His communal home was dire, shared with two other families. His former school teacher Vera Dmitrievna Gurevich said: “There was no hot water, no bathtub. The toilet was horrendous. And it was so cold, awful.” Putin was a street kid, small for his age and bullied so he had to toughen up fast. Masha Gessen, author of The Man Without A Face: The Unlikely Rise Of Vladimir Putin, says: “Putin’s parents worked pretty much around the clock, his mother ious unskilled jobs, his father at a factory. He was left to his own devices. He hung out in the courtyard with other boys, like all children did.  “And he was often picked upon and bullied until he started studying Sambo, a version of martial arts, and then later switched to Judo so he could compete.” He is now a black belt and likes the world to know it, some even referring to his inner circle as a “Judocracy”. Putin reflected in : “ years ago the Leningrad street taught me a rule:a fight is inevitable you have to throw the first punch.” Masha says: “He’s scrappy, very ambitious, very, very greedy.”She says Putin’s doting parents fed that greed. He had a wristwatch as a teen – something his dad didn’t have. When they won a car they reportedly gave it to their student son. Masha suggests by treating him as their “king”, Putin’s parents gave him a sense of entitlement. She said: “There’s a lot of proof he feels he is chosen now.” The proof could include his sprawling “Putin’s Palace” home, and those photos of him riding horses bare-chested. More recently, making French President Emmanuel Macron sit at the other end of a ridiculously long table says everything about his need to feel superior. According to the Kremlin website, Putin wanted to work in intelligence “even before he finished school”, and volunteered at . He holds a law degree from Leningrad State University plus a doctorate in economics, and was picked from  or more students for the KGB.  Pavel Koshelev, a college classmate and fellow KGB officer, said: “His most outstanding trait, I would say, was his fighting spirit and his strong will to achieve his goals.’’ In the late s, Putin was posted to Dresden, East Germany, reportedly to work in counter-espionage. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he rose to become head of the KGB’s successor, the FSB, and then Boris Yeltsin’s successor when he resigned in . Putin said his KGB career prepared him for presidency. That discipline is still clear today as he works  and -hour days, something which took its toll on his family le. He married Lyudmila Putina, a former air hostess, in the mid-s and doted on their two daughters. After he and Lyudmila orced in , she reportedly said: “Our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other. Vladimir is completely submerged in his work.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonEmmanuel MacronBoris YeltsinVladimir PutinUEFA Champions League FinalWorld War Petrol pricesBullyingPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Schietekat reported the June  incident at the Mexican consult to the Qatari police.But they responded and accused her of having an extramarital affair, reports in local media claim.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN.

The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look.

They learn five fantastic songs in their own classrooms before Scottish Opera teaching artists arrive at the school for a morning to teach movement and choreography to prepare for a -minute performance in front of fellow pupils, friends and family.The opera tells the story of a spaceship arriving in orbit around Earth with occupants who have travelled across the galaxy to convince everyone of the need to join together and take action to protect the planet for future generations.Down on the planet#s surface, scientists and the military are at complete loggerheads about what to do next and it all seems pretty bleak…until the visitors bring them a message that they can’t ignore.New ferry berthing infrastructure at Dunoon and Kilcreggan could cost as much as £ million, a report has revealed.An outline business case is currently being prepared by Argyll and Bute Council for the redevelopment of the ferry infrastructure at the two terminals.And it is estimated that improvements at Dunoon could carry a £m cost, while proposals for Kilcreggan could cost anywhere between £m and £m.A new passenger access system, designed to fit a new vessel and give slacker gradients, has also been revealed as the council’s preferred option for Dunoon.The Gourock, Dunoon and Kilcreggan Infrastructure and Vessels Project is a collaboration between the council, Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac Ferries Ltd.The report was discussed at the virtual meeting of the Cowal Transport Forum on Wednesday, February . A public consultation is to be run by the council seeking the public#s views.Whisky producer J  A Mitchell  Co is switching its energy supply from gas oil to liquid gas at its two Campbeltown distilleries in a bid to operate more efficiently and avoid the imminent withdrawal of tax relief on red diesel.As a result of switching to Flogas at Springbank and Glengyle distilleries, the company hopes to cut energy costs by up to  per cent, even before the subsidy changes, while also reducing carbon emissions by more than  per cent.It will also minimise other pollutant emissions, making it compliant with the government#s Medium Combustion Plant Directive , which regulates against air pollution.Springbank, the larger of the two distilleries, has been in operation since , while Glengyle, just  metres away, was refurbished and re-opened in .Findlay Ross, director of production at J  A Mitchell  Co, said: #Springbank is an old distillery that was never designed with efficiency or sustainability in mind, so we#ve had to make improvements whilst making sure we don#t affect our original distillation process or popular final product.#It was the best way to make huge cost and emissions reductions in one go, without affecting our production process.#"},{"url":null,"title":"council eyes uk funds for whisky isles","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA replacement Jura ferry, improved connections between Islay#s ferry ports and electric buses all remain part of a bid for UK Government funding in Argyll and Bute.Updated plans for a bid to the Levelling Up Fund have been revealed in a council report, with all four administrative areas of Argyll and Bute proposed to benefit.Plans for the #whisky isles# are now part of a collective £million transport bid entitled #Connected Argyll and Bute#.The deadline for bids to the fund is likely to be around Easter, with the council also submitting a £m regeneration bid for projects in Dunoon and Rothesay.The report was before the authority’s policy and resources committee at its virtual meeting on February .A report to the full council in September  noted: #Both Islay and Jura have seen substantial growth in the output of their spirits industry that makes a substantial contribution to the UK Exchequer.#This project concerns an investment in the critical infrastructure of the islands principally, improvements to the local road network linking both the ferry terminals on Islay, including carriageway interventions, active travel investments and an electric bus service.#This project will also involve the replacement of the current Jura Ferry with a larger hybrid or electric ferry together with road improvements on Jura.#This work would complement proposed investment by CMAL at Port Ellen with capital contributions sought from the private sector. In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience.

and many of us are really aching for spring now.This is the month for sowing seeds and getting the garden ready for the summer.But, before you rush to get sowing, take time to plan what you want to grow, how many plants you are going to need and when you want them to flower or bear fruit. This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"tourism drive builds urban and rural links","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowPeople from Scotland’s towns and cities to are being invited to #Go Rural# and visit a nearby farm or croft in .The Go Rural campaign will encourage urban residents to get out into the countryside, buy food and drink directly from a farmer, visit a farm for the day or book an overnight break or holiday.As well as making people aware of what is on their doorstep, there will be a focus on building knowledge and awareness of the countryside code and how to keep humans and animals safe in the countryside.The campaign is being delivered by sector body Scottish Agritourism, using the Go Rural consumer facing brand with support from other farming, rural and tourism organisations.The investment is part of a destination and sector marketing fund administered by VisitScotland as part of the Covid recovery programme on behalf of the Scottish Government.Activities will include live tours on social media every weekend, blogs and guides featuring the nearest Go Rural farms where people can buy or eat farm produce, visit for a day out or take a quick weekend change of scene.A series of podcasts and videos will capture the stories of dferent farmers across Scotland and a number of social media influencers and journalists will also visit dferent locations.Scottish Agritourism members are being encouraged to host events on farm over the Easter break with many planning spring farm tours to complement another two weeks of the popular #Lambathon# live on social media in April, which will form part of the overall campaign.Caroline Millar, sector lead for Scottish Agritourism, said: #In Scotland,  per cent of the population lives on two per cent of the land in urban areas.#Farmers are not only keen to welcome urban residents to visit the countryside, but to buy food and drink directly from a farmer and to have the opportunity to be able to have those on-farm discussions about how Scotland’s food and drink is produced, and what farmers do to look after the environment and landscape.#Visiting a farm and providing access to green space is hugely beneficial to a person’s mental and physical wellbeing.#We do however have a responsibility as an organisation encouraging thousands of people to visit the countryside to explain the importance of how to leave only footprints and how to act responsibly for the safety of farm animals, wildle, and people.#Conversations about responsible tourism will be a key focus of the campaign, delivered in a way which will inform and build relationships.#Farmers and crofters who don’t have an agritourism business can also take part by sharing content and using #GoRural."},{"url":null,"title":"linda-mccall-inquiry-borders-councils-handling-released","story":"A REPORT into Scottish Borders Council’shandling of allegations that a teacher was assaulting pupils at a school has been published.Elected members met in private last week to discuss the findings of Andrew Webster QC’s inquiry.And during that meeting it was agreed that the report should be released to the public, with councillors due to gather again on Fridayto talk through its recommendations.Linda McCall, of Earlston, was convicted of assaulting five vulnerable children in her care between August  and October .An internal investigation at SBC initially cleared the teacher of any wrongdoing.But parents persisted with their complaints and McCall was found guilty at a Selkirk Sherf Court trial of assaulting five pupils aged between five and seven years old while employed by the local authority.Mark Rowley, leader of SBC, said: “What happened between August  and October , when young people were assaulted whilst in school and subjected to abusive behaviour, is shocking and completely unacceptable. It was wrong and it should never have happened, and I am sorry that it did.“Last May, Scottish Borders Council agreed to commission an independent inquiry to look at how the council dealt with issues connected to the conviction of a former teacher for assault. The independent inquiry has considered any deficiencies in the handling of concerns that were raised and whether policies, processes and practice were right and appropriate at the time.“Such was the analysis required, and the sheer quantity of information considered, it has taken several months longer to conclude the independent inquiry than initially anticipated. Following a decision of council last Thursday I am pleased to say that the independent inquiry report will be published today in full, and it will be available online on the council’s website later at www.scotborders.gov.uk SBCinquiry.“It is important to read the report in its entirety as it provides a clear picture and timeline of what happened and when..remove“Andrew Webster QC spent time presenting the findings of his independent inquiry at a meeting of full council last Thursday, after which the council agreed unanimously to issue a written apology to the parents of the young people concerned. I can confirm that this has now been undertaken by the chief executive.“On behalf of the council, I am sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit at the earliest opportunity, as they should have been, and I am sorry that the council failed to communicate appropriately with those parents who had raised ious concerns. Most of all, the council apologises wholeheartedly that the incidents of abuse occurred in the first place.“We must now learn from these mistakes and ensure they are never repeated. At last Thursday’s meeting it was agreed that a further full council meeting be held, in public, at the earliest opportunity. This will allow further detailed consideration and discussion on the content of Mr Webster’s report and his recommendations, and of the next steps required by the council.“Mr Webster’s report will be published today as part of the papers for that council meeting, which will take place on Friday  February.”Carol Hamilton, SBC’s executive member for children and young people, added: “The report authored by Andrew Webster QC which will be published today is of acute interest to me and to many people across the Borders. Although the report addresses the response of the council as a whole, I will be considering the detail and paying particular attention to the recommendations as they apply to education.“For my part, I too am deeply saddened by contents of the report. It makes for very uncomfortable reading.“I am clearly sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit early on, and I am sorry that communication with the parents was so clearly wrong. It should never have happened and we should have done much better.“I will be working closely with my fellow Elected Members to fully consider the Independent Inquiry report, and to look at how we ensure the abuse experienced by these young people does not happen again. I offer my heartfelt apologies to these children for what they experienced.“Changes will inevitably follow such a major review, and we will provide further information on these as soon as we are able to do so.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-teenager-appointed-royal-bank-rugbyforce-2021-young-ambassador","story":"A TEENAGE rugby player from Hawick has been appointed as a Royal Bank RugbyForce  Young Ambassador.Stephen Cook will promote the town as a fantastic community focused club for young players with a proud tradition of developing international stars.The programme will involve him utilising his role as a coach and referee of junior rugby across primary school, S, S and Under  levels by engaging with and inspiring the next generation of players.And now the Royal Bank in partnership with Scottish Rugby, are encouraging more ambitious --year-olds across the country to become ‘Young Ambassadors’, tackling the tough issues facing amateur clubs and their local communities.Following on from nationwide success last year, the programme is back for  and Royal Bank are looking to grow their support for the next generation of grassroots leaders with a squad of  ‘Young Ambassadors’, who will take on responsible committee positions at their clubs.Each winning candidate will also receive specialist training and mentoring to develop key skills for effective club management, including seminars and events lead by former Scotland Internationals Jim Hamilton and Rory Lawson.Stephen Cook in action Backing the campaign, Scotland international and Edinburgh Rugby player, Jamie Ritchie said: “Having had the chance to meet last year’s Young Ambassadors and to see first-hand the impact their projects are having, it’s great to see the programme back again for .“This is a really important time for the grassroots game as we recover and rebuild from the effects of the last  months.

today. The First Minister was expected to address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policyand the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in Englandas of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic frameworkalso known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeonwill give an update to @ScotParlon #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAefrom :pm. pic LKTccbDIm— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , What did Nicola Sturgeon say today Boris Johnsons Living with Covid planNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.The First Minister criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.removeNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

In doing so, we are offering no mere conventional respect to a great public figure who has passed from us.#We did not think of George VI as a monarch living in high places, remote from the lives of the ordinary men and women of this realm.#Such was his le and character that his passing came as personal grief to everyone of his loyal subjects. We think today of a man who served us all with the highest and most self-sacricing sense of duty and probably beyond the limits of his strength – a man of complete integrity and of great personal courage and endurance.#His le exemplied the virtues on which, as we all know, the welfare of our nation depends. What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin interment, but below the average for a cremation.

le, from surfing in Cornwall to becoming part of Dunbar Coastal Rowing Club.A director of Dunbar Harbour Trust, he penned All Summer Long during lockdown and described it as “a wonderful coming of age”.Whilst at university, he escaped westwards every summer to be a professional leguard on Sennen Beach in Whitesands Bay, West Cornwall.After graduating, he spent six months as a teacher in Barbados, and three more months hitchhiking through the USA, Canada and Alaska, then overland through Central America to ‘hidden’ Popayan in the Andes of Colombia.He would go on to learn to fly with British Airways and was later a flying instructor, working almost everywhere in the world, including China, Russia, France and India.He said: “When I was about , I said to my mother: ‘We always seem to live in beautul places.’“We have moved around several times and she said: ‘Any fool can live in a horrible place.’“Her attitude was ‘don’t try to get yourself the most wonderful house you can afford but the most beautul area you can afford, even in the most humble dwelling’.”All Summer Long is released at the end of the month, with the author pleased to say he had some positive reviews from family members.The Dunbar resident said: “I’m suffering from imposter syndrome at the moment where I think it is not me and should not be me but the people who have read it say don’t feel bad because it is great.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-services-increase-temporary-timetable-ends","story":"The rail operator introduced a scaled back timetable in the wake of the Omicron iant of

First Minister was expected to address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"connect-music-festival-relaunching-edinburgh-summer","story":"The event, from the organisers of T in the Park and TRNSMT, will be held at the Royal Highland Centre, on the outskirts of Edinburgh.The weekend-long festival is set to be held from August  to , with the line-up announced later this week, although organisers DF Concerts and Events have promised a range of bands, DJs, performers and more.Katt Lingard, festival manager, said the company was ‘really excited about bringing Connect to le’.“It’s a very unique site and it gives us a fantastic opportunity to create a truly sustainable approach to the festival experience,” she said.Connect Music Festival comes from the organisers of TRNSMT Festival in Glasgow.

As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk gardening!"},{"url":null,"title":"m-s-pancake-day-2022-range-including-percy-pig-frying-pan-mixes-sauces-spreads","story":"The Percy Pig Pancake Pan is £ and comes with a pancake batter squeezy bottle for precise batter application.MS is also selling a Pancake Party Gt Bag for £ which includes two pancake mixes, maple syrup and recipe cards.In the offer you will get: class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Children from the area have participated in workshops with the local business owner and learned the ins and outs of bike mechanics while achieving formal qualications.Now, five years on from when he started, the project has expanded signicantly and recently moved into a building located in Robertson Park in Renfrew after receiving funding through community asset transfers by Renfrewshire Council.The Scot, who moved back to the country  years ago after growing up in South Africa, reflected on how far the community business has come and said why he started it in the first place.He said: “I started this with the ambition of purely helping kids who struggle like I once did in school.“I started by going round to the schools to do workshops, but after receiving funding through the council who gave us this property, we managed to get the new shop up and running, and we run workshops all day during the week.“The schools select the children who may struggle with mainstream education and send them down to our workshops. All our bikes are donated from the community, the council, or local skips and other bike shops. We then teach the kids how to diagnose the problems and how to fix anything on a bike. After that they are refurbished and sold back into the community at a very discounted price.“I’ve had a lot of friends in the past who have struggled in school and other areas of le and I just really want to help local youngsters to try make sure similar things don’t happen to them.”The local entrepreneur has received praise from the community in Renfrew and local councillors. Councillor John Shaw who represents Renfrew North and Braehead said Dave’s business has had an extremely positive impact on the area.He said: “Dave and the team at Kustom Kruizers have been a hugely positive addition to the local community doing some inspiring work with local schools and offering positive opportunities for young people to develop.“Their drive and vision shown in turning the formerly derelict public toilets into a valuable asset for the community is a shining example of how positively community asset transfers and partnership working can aid community development.”To mark the completion of the renovated building, Dave recently commissioned a mural on the projects new shop. The artwork shows Dave’s daughter fixing an old school rally burner, which he described as the most iconic BMX of all time.The mural was created by Renfrewshire artist, Bmoresketchy who said he was attracted to the project because of the ethos behind it.: Mural artist brings Renfrew primary schoolkids ideas to le in stunning mural projectBmoresketchy, whose real name is Stephen Blackmore, said: “I love doing commissions with a good story behind them. Painting murals which are just to look pretty come ten a penny, but when I get the chance to paint a piece with meaning it really draws me in.\"I think what Dave does for the community is really commendable. So, to be able to represent what Kustom Kruizers is all about in mural form was a fulfilling commission for me. The response from the public was incredible seeing the process too as they were full of encouragement and compliments as they passed.”Owner Dave Neil with artist Bmoresketchy With the new building, comes a newfound respect for what Dave says is a ‘hub’ for local kids. In the six months he has had the building there has been not one incident of vandalising or graffiti.With the success of the project now coming to le in front of Dave, he now has ideas for a bigger future, and national expansion is on his mind.He said: “I started this to try help keep kids out of trouble, and I want this to be just the first for Kustom Kruizers. I hope to have this successfully running for a few years, and then approach other councils within Scotland and let them know that they need this.“I’d love it as a franchise across the country that helps give back to all areas and get everyone back into cycling.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-ridiculous-use-chernobyl-damn-nuclear-power","story":"If Mr Patrick thinks we should shut down all nuclear power stations, presumably he also thinks we should ban flying.

There you are, sitting in moderate comfort while you travel at  mph, six miles above the earth outside, separated from you by a thin skin, the air temperature is -C and there’s very little oxygen. An incredibly dangerous thing to do, but made safe to the point of being mundane by technology, design and human skill. It’s the same in the nuclear industry: there are several hundred nuclear power plants operating safely around the world, and extrapolating from one episode at Chernobyl is ridiculous.Frances McKieclaims that nuclear is “a technology that does not work”. Ms McKie had better let the citizens of France know, as they get  per cent of their electricity from nuclear indeed they sell some of it to us when the wind doesn’t blow. There’s no one solution to the energy and climate crises we face, but it would be the height of foolishness to put all our eggs in the rather unreliable basket of wind, solar and tidal.Dough Maughan, Dunblane.SO DID WE REALLY WIN THE WAR SOME historians believe that Russia and China pose a lower threat than did Germany after its  invasion of Czechoslovakia.But, inter alia, the United States was the emerging dominant power, the UK with the Empire was still militarily important, China was relatively insignicant, and our enemies had no nuclear weapons. There was no Russia China Iran axis or equivalent controlling Europe’s energy supply, much of its economic needs, and with growing influence throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America.Will the democracies’ leaders now accept that not only did the West not “win the Cold War”, but that,our enemy was not only Hitler’s Germany but all \"nazi\" states, it is also premature to claim we won the Second World War  Both wars merely paused, while the totalitarians whether red, brown or black-shirted, secular or religious, engaged in “reculer pour mieux sauter”.With its rise and its cyber warfare abilities, and our lack of leadership and self-confidence, that axis can peel away salami-fashion at the democracies’ weaknesses to impose its Orwellian future on the world while avoiding major military operations against us.John Birkett, St Andrews.BANK COMPLAINTS SYSTEM IS WOEFULI RECENTLY had occasion to lodge a complaint against the Bank of Scotland. The frustration that led me to complain in the first place was greatly intensied by the complaints process itself, which seems to operate on the principle that the customer is always wrong, despite manest failings on the bank’s part. In my case, these included a nonsensical response to my initial written request – requesting a signature that was already on my letter: a denial that the bank had my mobile number, despite the fact that I received two identical text messages from the bank to that number a failure to send a promised form that the bank said I must complete and sloppy addressing of correspondence to me.The matter is still not resolved. I have been told it will take up to eight weeks to reach a decision on what should be a simple matter – closing a small account for a group of residents in a block of flats . I am one of the approved signatories to the account, with all transactions requiring two approved signatures. An unnamed complaints manager will phone me within an unspecied time scale. And, of course,I am not satisfied, I can take my case to the Financial Conduct Authority. That’s no comfort at all, as people have lost faith in regulatory bodies. They are seen as heavily stacked in favour of big institutions and against inidual complainants.No doubt many other people will have had similar experiences.Walter Humes, Newton Mearns.ENGLISH LESSON FOR THE BBCLEAH Gunn Barrettsays the BBC always puts England first.

Airports should be subject to the same rules and regulations as anyone .: Scotland records largest number of deaths due to alcohol“It’s a unique situation where people are leaving a licensed premises and going into a confined area. People are in a dferent frame of mind and some do over-drink.“We see groups of men and women and they do tend to abuse alcohol and when they are going onto planes it can be quite dficultthey are unruly.”Mr Waterson said it was also worth noting that some of the carriers were offering double measures for single prices, which is illegal in Scotland.He added: “Very oftenyou order spiritsthe small bottles are a higher strength that people are used to and sometimes that leads to over-indulgence.”: Ministers accused of dropping the ball on world-leading alcohol policyPub chain Wetherspoons slammed the idea of restricting pub hours, claiming it would “adversely affect the tourist industry” as most holiday destinations worldwide allow drinking at pubs before flying.Eddie Gershon said: “Wetherspoon applies the same strict policies and procedures to prevent excessive consumption of alcohol in its airport sites as it does in all its pubs.“We work closely with the airport authorities and other operators to ensure the safety of all passengers , which is paramount.“We do not believe that additional prohibitions are necessary, although airport authorities, in conjunction with the licensed trade, should be vigilant in not permitting the minority who abuse the system onto flights.”: Scotland urged to end breakfast pints in major post-Covid changeThe Airport Operators Associationsaid incidents involving disruptive passengers are rare but some budget carriers including Ryanair are supportive of restricting airport bar hours.Aircraft and bars and restaurants beyond security are fully exempt from licensing laws. Pubs in area outwith this area are not exempt, and the airport’s local licensing authority is responsible for licensing venues.In Scotland, under the LicensingAct , all offences that apply to premises on the high street, also apply airside, such as selling alcohol to an intoxicated inidual.This is dferent from England  Wales, where some offences only apply to licensed venues.     "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : pmThe First Minister has announced today that the legal requirements for COVID- certication and wearing face coverings will be withdrawn.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Forty impact statements from businesses affected have also been forwarded to the council.John Clark of Gordons Chemist told councillors his staff at the Cornmarket store said the High Street entrance was regularly blocked off by street preachers. He said: “Staff talked about how people came into the pharmacy saying they felt threatened, and did not want to come down Cornmarket running that cordon of preachers.”He added: “Myself and the company have absolutely no issue with preaching, we have no issue with there being rules about these sorts of things. But what we are experiencing goes way and above simple preaching. The issues are also about the noise coming from them, from musicians, and mainly, the use of ampliers.”He said: “We operate confidential pharmacy services. We have had many patients and customers leave the pharmacy because they couldn’t actually be heard, between the noise, them and staff wearing masks. Our staff are stressed because of the complaints, and because they can’t hear the customers who are then leaving the store.”He said: “There is an element of confidentiality, anda patient has to speak louder because of the din and racket from outside in Cornmarket, then we can’t be sure that the confidentiality is being honoured. And they feel uncomfortable, there is no doubt about that.”He added: “This is not about religion, it is about noise pollution. But also I think there needs to be immediate action in relation to anybody who is preaching homophobia and anti-Semitism. And that has been witnessed. These people are very cute. They will turn their amplier downthe police neighbourhood officer arrives.”He said: “It has been said to me before that a person doesn’t have to walk past the preacher or musician. Well actually our staff have absolutely no say in that. They have to work  from nine in the morning to six at night and are subjected to this all of the hours it happens. They can’t leave, they can’t go up a dferent street. The council must be cognisant of that fact.”Geraldine Duggan, of Belfast City Centre Management said: “Coming out of those business impact statements very clearly is the effect these activities have on the mental health of employees. It’s not just about the bottom line and profitability, it is about the health of the employees.”Starbucks regional area manager Barbara McMaster added: “The noise level and the impact on staff is horrendous at times. The groups will have a stand-off, the homophobic group will start shouting louder than the preaching group, and it just escalates and escalates,” she added.“We have a very erse staff, and they have to run the gauntlet with all that. They have no choice but to listen, and make their way through it to get into work at Castle Lane. Some of them have been quite upset by what they have been hearing.“We have had staff been told to go back to their own country, simply because they couldn’t be heard, despite their language skills being excellent. That has a very detrimental effect.“We had a leaver last week who said one of the reasons he left was the antisocial behaviour in the city centre and what he has to deal with, and having to listen to the homophobic abuse in the city centre at certain times of the day.“It is intimidating, some of the language that is used is insulting, and it is deafening at times. We need to do something holistically to sort this out.”Sinn Fein councillor Christina Black said: “I think we need to recognise there is an issue with Cornmarket. The atmosphere is negative, and feels confrontational. It is not welcoming presently.“Everyone has the right to protest, to gather, to express their own views, but there are definitely points in the city centre where it is not conducive to a good retail, visiting or even walking experience for people who live in the city.”Alliance councillor Michael Long said: “It has been fascinating to hear how this impacts on staff, and that there is a responsibility here because staff are being traumatised.”He added: “This really is putting off people going into shops close by. It is something very worrying, and there is a depressing atmosphere around it. It is not what we want when we are trying to get people back into our city centre.” Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdaySammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsBow Street Mall Lisburn: Man arrested on suspicion of carrying an imitation firearmNorthern Ireland weather alert: Yellow warning issued for ‘blizzard conditions’ and gusty windsTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Brad Pitt as ‘Mickey O’Neil’ in Snatch - Strong LanguageLatest Northern IrelandFormer footballer Paddy McCourt says he is ‘definitely not guilty’ in sex assault caseEx-Celtic star McCourt protests innocence in court appearance on sex chargeAnxious wait for river levels to peak in flooded areasNorthern Ireland braced for ‘heavy and blustery’ snow from pmTwo-and-a-half wards worth of patients waiting for treatment at Antrim hospital on Tuesday eveningLatest‘Unthinkable’ that Alex Salmond still has show on RT, says First Minister‘Signicant’ jump in proportion of close contacts taking daily Covid- testsRussia evacuates Ukraine embassy as region braces for further confrontationFewer people living near major banks and building societies as branches shutSturgeon: UK must turn rhetoric on Russia into action in ‘critical moment’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

undersold in first round of city deal funding","story":"DUP MP Gregory Campbell has said Northern Ireland was ‘undersold’ in the first round of funding associated with the UK Government’s City Deals initiative  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Gregory Campbell has said Northern Ireland was ‘undersold’ in the first round of funding associated with the UK Government’s City Deals initiative By Rebecca Black, PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland was “undersold” in the first round of funding associated with the UK Government’s City Deals initiative, an MP has claimed.A £ billion Belfast Region City Deal was signed in , covering six local authorities, including the capital.It was designed to offer funding and powers to local and regional bodies to target key industries in these areas based on their potential for growth, such as financial services and digital tech.However, DUP MP Gregory Campbell said Northern Ireland was “undersold” compared with other regions of the UK.He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that Scotland got £ million more than anticipated and Wales received £ million more than expected, but Northern Ireland was given £. million less than anticipated.“We were the only region of the UK that was undersold,” he said, and demanded that efforts are made to avoid this happening in the second round which, he noted, opens in the next few weeks.What we#re trying to do with these funds and with the City Deal is to have alignment, and the hardest thing in getting alignment is when you don#t really understand the rulesDamien Martin, Belfast Region City DealHis comments came during the committee’s fourth oral evidence session of its Investment In Northern Ireland inquiry.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Damien Martin, programme manager, Belfast Region City Deal, earlier told MPs it is “still very early days” in relation to funds, but they hope to secure a “fair share around research and development”.He complained of a lack of clarity around the process.“There is still that sense in Northern Ireland that we’re not quite sure how it’s going to work … we have had more detail recently around levelling up and shared prosperity,” he said.He added there is a feeling that the first round of applications had been challenging in terms of the timescale, adding that they hope to get clarity.“What we’re trying to do with these funds and with the City Deal is to have alignment, and the hardest thing in getting alignment is when you don’t really understand the rules,” he said.“So, it’s much, much harder for us to bring partners together, to bring universities, colleges, other councils together, because often the way we see it is that those collective bids are likely to be much more effective than inidual partner bids, but that’s dficult to do without clarity.”Responding to Mr Campbell, Mr Martin said the first round had been considered very challenging in terms of preparing bids.“I know that there are concerns that the next round is coming up very soon and there still isn’t full understanding of how it is going to be administered and how it is going to work in Northern Ireland,” he said.“So that is a concern that potentially we could have that same issue again.”We#re very keen that all levels of government work together to help businesses revitalise our high streetBelfast Lord Mayor Kate NichollHe said the lead UK Government departments have committed to engage and try to explain how the funds will work in more detail.Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl emphasised to MPs the importance of developing skills.She said it is hoped the City Deal will tackle lower levels of productivity, a lack of investment, and high levels of economic inactivity and skills, adding that the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the challenges.“We’re very keen that all levels of government work together to help businesses revitalise our high street,” she said.Ms Nicholl told MPs that Northern Ireland faces the additional challenge of the “brain drain”, where young people leave and do not .She said the City Deal’s focus on innovation and digital skills offers potential jobs for young people, describing the investment as “really key”.Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on

There was a stillness in the corridors before members filed into the chamber.Around the base of the Great Hall’s famous Stormont steps, in the moments before the Assembly was due to meet, the DUP team stood in quiet reflection following the sudden death of Christopher Stalford MLA, aged just .Read MoreWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher StalfordSuzanne Breen:OpinionBlessed with insight and wit, talking with Christopher was never dullThey took a moment, led in prayer by Mervyn Storey, heads bowed at the passing of their colleague and friend. There was silence as MLAs took their seats.They all have their places. You know where to look to catch the look of someone in particular, eyeing each other up across the political ide.But the barricades were down today. A ceasefire akin to the Christmas truce of  when the British and German forces met in no man’s land, exchanged gts and even played a friendly game of football.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As then, hostilities at Stormont will resume, but at noon on Monday there was little appetite for the usual cut and thrust. Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances. But it doesn’t surprise me at all that my last conversation with him was about his children and his family, because they were at the heart of everything he did.”Those on the sharpest end of his tongue will miss his presence too.Sinn Fein’s Emma Sheerin added: “You knew that when you met him outside you’d be met with warmth, a bit of craic, good humour, and a genuine friendly comment.”Her party colleague, John O’Dowd, said: “Christopher Stalford was a formidable political opponent. There were times when I debated with Christopher that I tried not to like him afterwards, but I couldn’t. He was such an affable inidual.”The sharp suits, the sharp tongue – it will all be missed at Stormont.But Christopher Stalford, as all those who paid their respects noted, will be even more sorely missed by the family he has left behind.Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceChristopher Stalford funeral: Service for DUP MLA to be held on SaturdaySammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsBow Street Mall Lisburn: Man arrested on suspicion of carrying an imitation firearmNorthern Ireland weather alert: Yellow warning issued for ‘blizzard conditions’ and gusty windsTop VideosPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and knePlayBelfast publican hits out at council over state of Belfast Cathedral Quarter areaPlayVideo: The worst Irish accents in film history - Brad Pitt as ‘Mickey O’Neil’ in Snatch - Strong LanguageLatest PoliticsGet Stormont up and running again, NIO minister Conor Burns tells DUP’s DonaldsonGAA set to issue guidance as Tyrone club is criticised for memorial to IRA menSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of border, children waiting for help from NI mental health servicesPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherLatestFuel prices reach new highs due to Ukraine crisisDPP yet to decide on charges as suspect in death of Ashling Murphy appears in courtPatel warns of Russian threat to UK amid tensions over UkraineElton John jet forced to abort journey following hydraulic failure – reportsWomenswear leads the way as Ted Baker sales soar,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply. With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead. Indeed in the view of many people the road will have to go ahead.Another councillor has already suggested a dferent potential line which is understood to cut through part of the Down High School playing fields.CLOUGH ndash Clough Presbyterian Church Hall was built in , is being demolished to make way for a car park beside the new hall which is nearing completion.However, not all of the historic structure is being discarded. The original pitch pine rafters, Bangor Blue slates and main entrance doors have been kept.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Nations around the world are far less prone to major conflicts than they were a century ago.At the same time though, Mr Aiken is plainly justied in his observation that no-one was expecting a global conflict in either the summer of  or of . Thus it is important to be vigilant about how tensions and localised disputes can unravel in disastrous ways.There is another respect in which to be very anxious right now: the possibility that three nations that are at best wary of Europe and America, at worst positively hostile — Russia, China and Iran — could take advantage of current events in order to achieve long cherished regional goals through aggression.And evena Russian invasion of Ukraine does not lead to a wider war, it will on its own be a completely unacceptable precedent of a major international country invading, or taking territory by force, in the nd century.One of the most benign possible outcomes now is that Russia merely seizes the pro Russian enclaves in Ukraine, as it did Crimea — and even that is an utterly unacceptable abuse of power to change borders unilaterally.The immediate announcement of sanctions by a range of countries including the UK is a necessary first step but it is far from clear whether these initial penalties are enough, or whether they will even cause President Vladimir Putin much concern.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe strategy Wales: A Sustainable Space Nation sets out ious areas where the country hopes to lead growth, including in the development of greener fuels and reusable technology.The UK’s space sector as a whole has trebled in size to £. billion a year since  and has set a target of achieving a  per cent share of the global market by .Wales hopes to secure five per cent of the UK’s market by , economy minister Vaughan Gething said, boosting its economy by £ billion per year.Among the plans are the development of Spaceport Snowdonia on the former Llanbedr airfield, as well as a sea-based launch  operating from Port Talbot.There are also projects developing greener fuels and propulsion technologies, including at the Llanbedr site, and at military testing facilities in Ceredigion, Powys and Pendine in Carmarthenshire.Elsewhere, satellite technologies used to find water on other planets are being used to monitor Wales’ shting coal tips.Speaking to the PA news agency, Mr Gething said sustainability was at the core of the strategy.The minister said: “It is about propulsion, the new fuels that you might use, as well as having the things you might want to put into space already off the ground as well in a more environmentally-friendly way.”He continued: “Space Forge, who are a signicant Welsh start-up, are expanding at a real rate and they are looking at reusable technology.“They are looking both at being able to send equipment into space and for it to be ed and reused, but also the potential to manufacture items while in space as well.“So you are looking at both re-use and decarbonising the way that we put items into space and that in itself will be important for air travel.”He said many major space tech companies already have a base in Wales, including Qioptiq, which manufactures  per cent of the glass products used in space exploration..remove“Spaceport Snowdonia is already undertaking testing for the potential of the next generation of space travel and space technology,” Mr Gething said.“Space Forge and BSpace who are located near Newport are looking at how you can partially float items and then have propulsion that is already off the ground.“That would actually save potentially a signicant amount of the fuel you need to actually make lt-off.”The minister added: “Crucially, the academic partnerships that are powering much of this space exploitation, our university sector here has a really good record in that.”A signicant driver behind the strategy is the need to create well-paid, highly-skilled graduate jobs in Wales to try and stem the exodus of young people to other parts of the UK looking for work.Mr Gething said: “If we are going to see a successful economic future we need more young people to realise that you don’t have to get out to get on and provide real opportunities to do that.“I am happy for people to move around and travel and work in the rest of the UK and the rest of the world, but I want those people to feel like the really can secure and set up a business here in Wales or join a company or a business that can give them a real economic future.”British astronaut Tim Peake said: “Space has an ability to inspire and educate future generations, as well as being at the heart of solving some of today’s toughest challenges.“Technology and innovation are key to growing our economy with a skilled workforce and I’m delighted to see that Wales is embracing the exciting opportunities that the space sector has to offer.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA dog is seen by many as another member of the family but it’s important to remember they do require a dferent diet to humans and some ingredients in pancakes could lead to tummy troubles of even health problems like diabetes.Not wanting pups to miss out, Ocado have partnered with an expert in pet nutrition to create a recipe which is safe for dogs – even those with particularly sensitive tums.Stephen Ward is the Founder of Heights Farm Premium Pet Foods – a high-quality, independent pet food manufacturer designed for animals with allergies and intolerances. Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfebbebdbcbdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eecbeaacfebfcecfbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.
