File photograph: Shamil ZhumatovReutersNursultan Nazarbayev, the only leader that independent Kazakhstan has ever known, has abruptly announced his resignation after three decades in power, raising uncertainty over the country’s future course.The 78-year-old said in a televised address to the oil-rich nation that he had taken the difficult decision to terminate his authority as president, effective on Wednesday.He did not give a reason, but noted that he would have marked 30 years in the job later this year.He said he sees his mission as ensuring the transfer of power to a new generation of politicians.“It was an honour for me to serve the people,” he said. “I have worked hard to fulfil the nation’s will.”Mr Nazarbayev added that he would retain the position of the chairman of the nation’s security council and the head of the ruling party. “I will serve you until the end of my days,” he said.He said upper-house speaker Kassym-Jomart Tokayev will serve as interim head of state in line with the constitution until a new election is held.Kazakhstan, despite having a population of only 18 million, is the ninth largest country in the world with an area of more than a million square miles. It borders Russia to the north and China to the east and has extensive oil reserves that make it strategically and economically important.Thirty years in powerMr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as its Communist Party chief when it was part of the Soviet Union, and was first elected president weeks before the 1991 Soviet collapse.In those days, Kazakhstan was a backwater region best known for prisons, nuclear testing sites and being the home of the launch facility of the Soviet space programme, the Baikonur Cosmodrome.Mr Nazarbayev has been widely praised for maintaining stability and ethnic peace in Kazakhstan but has also faced criticism for marginalising the political opposition and creating what is effectively a one-party state.He has maintained a delicate balance between Russia and the West, leading Kazakhstan to join a Russia-dominated economic alliance of ex-Soviet nations, but cultivating close energy ties and other links with the West.He was lauded abroad for modernising the oil industry and his decision to give up the nuclear weapons Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union.In 1997, he moved the country’s capital from Almaty to the remote northern city of Astana in what was widely considered a way to fuse the ethnic-Russian minority in the north to the new Kazakh state.The new city was filled with post-modern architecture including the soaring glass pyramid of the Palace of Peace and Accord, dedicated to harmony among religious and ethnic groups.In 2010, Mr Nazarbayev was awarded the title of Leader of the Nation, which comes with lifelong immunity from prosecution and as-yet untested powers of veto over some government policies.ProtestsHe departs at a time of rare open protest against the government.He fired his prime minister and cabinet last month following a wave of protests by Kazakh women calling for more financial support for children and safer housing after a fire in which five children died.Soon after, he announced a programme of more generous spending for large families.He has extended his tenure by landslide victories in successive elections and plebiscites. He took nearly 98 per cent of the vote in the most recent election, in 2015, when he was elected for another five-year term.His resignation will set the stage for a potential battle between Russia and the US for influence with the successor government.Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had spoken with Mr Nazarbayev by telephone earlier on Tuesday but did not say what they discussed.Mr Nazarbayev was born into a poor rural labourer’s family on July 6th, 1940. As a young adult, he worked in harsh conditions at a steel plant’s blast furnace and at 22 he joined the Communist Party.He worked his way up in the party, went to university and became known for his comparatively candid assessments of the Soviet Union’s shortcomings.That turn of mind positioned him in the reformist camp that came to ascendancy when Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985.Mr Nazarbayev was the last of Central Asia’s former Communist Party bosses to remain in power after the deaths of Turkmenistan’s Saparmurat Niyazov in 2006 and Uzbekistan’s Islam Karimov in 2016.The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, is now the region’s longest-serving head of state, having assumed power in 1992 during a civil war. – Associated Press"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3831391.1553005441!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit tusk tells varadkar of strong and ongoing solidarity with ireland","story":" Political Editor Pat Leahy reports from Government Buildings as EU Council President Donald Tusk meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of this week\u0027s crucial EU Council meeting in Brussels.

Photograph: Matt DunhamAFPGetty ImagesEuropean Council president Donald Tusk has said all other EU leaders expressed “strong and ongoing solidarity with Ireland” on the Brexit issue, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk met for some 90 minutes in Government Buildings on Tuesday ahead of the critical European Summit in Brussels later this week. The meeting came amid reports British prime minister Theresa May was writing a letter to the EU on Tuesday asking for an extension to Brexit beyond the deadline of March 29th. The United Kingdom’s plans to leave the EU were thrown into further chaos on Monday night after the Speaker of the House of Commons said Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement could not be put to another vote without substantial changes. But the EU has ruled out making any changes to the withdrawal agreement or offering further legal assurances beyond those agreed in Strasbourg last week.The move by Mr Bercow put Mrs May’s plan to win parliamentary approval for the deal in deep disarray. Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk discussed what was described as the “state of play and latest developments with Brexit” including Monday’s intervention by House of Commons speaker John Bercow. It has cast doubt over a third meaningful vote on prime minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement taking place this week. In a statement issued shortly after the meeting, Mr Varadkar said both leaders had “agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.“Meanwhile, preparations continue in Ireland and across the European Union for a no deal scenario, which would have serious consequences for all concerned.In a post on his Twitter account following the meeting, Mr Tusk said they had discussed the latest developments in the Brexit negotiations, and the “uncertain political situation in London as well as preparedness for a no-deal Brexit”. Mr Tusk arrived in Government Buildings shortly after 11.30am and was greeted by An Taoiseach. Both leaders proceeded into the meeting without responding to questions from the media.Mr Tusk has been a regular visitor to Dublin during the Brexit process. He has used each visit to emphasise EU support for Ireland’s position on the backstop. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said in a tweet that Mrs May would write to the European Union to ask for a Brexit extension until the end of June and with a possible two-year delay. Mrs May’s spokesman confirmed she had wrote to Mr Tusk to request a delay to Brexit on Tuesday. Kuenssberg said on Twitter after Tuesday’s cabinet meeting in London: “Cabinet sources say PM is writing letter to EU today asking for extension - frustration that she is going to ask for end date of June 30th, with proviso of delay of up to 2 years.” She added: “One source says there was no agreement in the room, another source furious that it seems PM avoiding making an actual decision again about the option she would like to take but wants option of short delay to try to find way of having another go with her deal.” Coveney in Brussels Meanwhile Tánaiste Simon Coveney is in Brussels where he will meet separately with European Parliament’s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt and the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. A European Commission spokesman said on Tuesday negotiators are awaiting the UK government’s decision on how to proceed. At the daily press briefing in Brussels he said: “We’re now exactly 10 days away from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. “We naturally follow all developments in the House of Commons very closely but it’s not for us to comment on or intervene in parliamentary procedures or conventions of the UK. “It will be for the prime minister and her government to decide on the next steps and then to inform us accordingly and swiftly.” - additional reporting Agencies Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The speaker didn’t alert the government to his statement in advance and Downing Street was clearly nonplussed. Photograph: PA WireThe prospect of a vote this week on Theresa May’s Brexit deal was already receding before Commons speaker John Bercow delivered his dramatic statement to the House on Monday afternoon. Although negotiations with the DUP appeared to be going reasonably well, the prime minister’s efforts to persuade Brexiteers to back her deal seemed to have stalled. Bercow didn’t alert the government to his statement in advance, much less what he was about to say, and Downing Street was clearly nonplussed. Although the speaker said May’s Brexit deal could not be put to a vote if it was substantially the same as the proposition MPs rejected last week, he was imprecise about what might constitute a substantial change. LifelineDowning Street acknowledges that the deal itself cannot be changed and the concessions the prime minister secured in Strasbourg last week were the last the EU will offer. The negotiations with the DUP could offer a lifeline, however, in the form of a promise to put into legislation a promise that if the backstop requires Northern Ireland to adopt new EU regulations the rest of the UK will follow suit. If May attempts to put her deal to a vote next week, the addition of that promise to the DUP could help her to make the case that MPs would not be voting on the same proposition as they did last week.ExtensionSo too could the conditions attached to an extension of Britain’s membership of the EU beyond March 29th. Before Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels, May will write to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the article 50 deadline. Although all 27 other EU leaders must agree unanimously to an extension, they cannot impose conditions on it. This is because the European Council cannot legislate and because if Britain remains in the EU beyond March 29th, it will enjoy all the rights of a member state. So Britain will volunteer to abide by certain conditions, including staying out of discussions about the future of the EU and the next multi-annual budget and promising not to obstruct EU business.OfficialThen the EU can agree to offer an extension of up to nine months, with EU leaders sketching it out at the summit and making it official in a simplified written procedure next week.If Bercow allows a vote and MPs approve May’s deal next week, Britain can leave the EU as soon as it is ready. If it is staying in the EU for more than a few weeks, Britain will have to hold European Parliament elections towards the end of May. To do so, May’s government will have to set the ball rolling by April 11th, yet another deadline on the long, unpredictable road to Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker of the House of Commons John Bercow: his political views have changed radically over the years. Photograph:  PA WireIn sport, some umpires tip the balance. In the arts, some critics outshine the performers. And in British politics, the speaker of the House of Commons now often wields more influence than the MPs he oversees.He was savaged by several British newspapers on Tuesday, with the  calling him “the Brexit destroyer”. Late last year Bercow faced calls from some Conservative MPs to resign as speaker because of bullying allegations, which he has denied.But Labour MPs backed him to stay in post, aware of his passionate commitment to parliament holding the government to account – and thereby making May’s life difficult.In January he allowed a manoeuvre by pro-EU MPs to force May to present a Brexit plan B within days after she lost her first vote.Conservatives fumed that Bercow (55) was tearing up years of parliamentary precedent.“If we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change,” replied Bercow, who served as a Tory MP before he was elected speaker and took on a responsibility to be politically impartial. Bercow has the power to select which MPs’ amendments to May’s Brexit deal are voted on. Upsetting the executiveSince he became speaker in 2009, Bercow has never shied away from upsetting the executive. In 2013 he allowed Eurosceptic Tory MPs to seek to amend the Queen’s Speech, outlining the government’s legislative programme, in a way that some argued pushed the then prime minister David Cameron into accepting a Brexit referendum. Last year he blocked US president Donald Trump from addressing parliament on his state visit to the UK, citing Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism”.While some Tories appreciate the power he has given to rank-and-file MPs, others fume at what they see as bias. “Some of the ways he talks to our colleagues is unacceptable,” said one senior Conservative MP. “And I’ve never once seen him talk like that to Labour.” Another Tory MP said Bercow was “so unprofessional”.Bercow has defended his handling of Commons debates. A spokeswoman said: “The speaker champions good order in the chamber and parliament’s right to have its say.”Much of the government’s difficulties in parliament stem from the Conservatives’ lack of a Commons majority.Nonetheless, grumbling about Bercow has increased since November. On one occasion when May addressed the Commons on Brexit, the first 31 MPs who Bercow called to speak were all critics of her deal.He was then instrumental in helping Labour to bring an unprecedented motion of contempt in the government, for failing to publish its Brexit legal advice.“The speaker has a political agenda, which is wholly inappropriate,” said James Duddridge, a Conservative MP who led an unsuccessful effort to unseat him in 2017. “Labour find him convenient, because he’s a more effective opposition than their own leader. Who’s made more hits on the government – speaker Bercow . . . or Jeremy Corbyn?”Cab driver’s sonBercow’s rise to prominence is notable for how his political views have changed radically over the years.The son of a London cab driver, he joined a Conservative youth group that produced “Hang Nelson Mandela” posters.Elected as a Tory MP in 1997, he was initially a staunch Eurosceptic. But he moderated his views, and was elected speaker, with Labour support, when the Commons was at a low ebb following the MPs’ expenses scandal.His modernising moves have included the election by MPs of Commons select committee chairs, seizing a power previously held by party whips.Although parliament’s procedures are set out in a book known as Erskine May, he has revived previously little-used arrangements – such as urgent Commons questions, which force ministers to reply to MPs’ concerns on an issue of the day.On Monday, he cited a convention dating back to 1604 in his statement ruling out a third vote on May’s Brexit deal. Even admirers of Bercow, a tennis fanatic, say there is a flipside: grandstanding, pomposity and flashes of rudeness.Last year Bercow was accused of calling Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, “a stupid woman” – a claim he has denied. His former private secretary signed a non-disclosure agreement in 2010, after claiming he had been shouted and sworn at by the speaker. A report by Laura Cox, a former judge who investigated complaints of bullying by Commons staff, concluded it was “difficult to envisage” a culture change under current leadership.No one disputes Bercow’s love of his job. “I am an unusual fellow,” he once told MPs. “I enjoy few things more than listening to my colleagues asking questions and ministers answering them.”Perhaps his love for parliament explains his distaste for a second referendum: in 2017, he described the prospect as “absolutely for the birds”.The speaker has indicated he will step down in 2019, a year later than he first promised. Until then, many MPs admit that trying to sway him is about as effective as shouting at the referee.“It’s a game,” said one minister. “Some people try to rile him. But he’s more powerful. In the chamber he’s all powerful.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to win parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal was in deep disarray last night after the Speaker of the House of Commons said it could not be put to another vote without substantial changes.Citing a convention dating back to 1604 that was last used in 1920, John Bercow said the prime minister could not put the same question to MPs in a single parliamentary session.“If the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the House on March 12, this would be entirely in order. What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes,” he said.The Speaker’s statement, which took the government by surprise, came as ministers continued to negotiate with the DUP over the terms on which it could support Mrs May’s deal. If it is not approved at Westminster by Wednesday the prime minister will ask EU leaders on Thursday to agree to delay Brexit, perhaps by nine months.Prorogue parliamentSolicitor general Robert Buckland said the Speaker’s statement meant the government might have to ask Queen Elizabeth to prorogue parliament – ending the current session and immediately starting a new one.“We are in a major constitutional crisis here. There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session. We are talking about hours to March 29th. Frankly we could have done without this,” he told the BBC.Mr Bercow’s statement delighted hard Brexiteers who want Britain to leave the EU without a deal on March 29th, as well as ardent Remainers who want to reverse Brexit through a second referendum.Government was outragedAlthough Downing Street’s official response was to say the Speaker’s statement required “proper consideration”, the government was outraged by the intervention, of which it received no prior warning.Mr Bercow said the statement was not his last word on the subject but he suggested the Brexit deal itself would have to be changed for a new vote to be held.The EU has ruled out making any changes to the withdrawal agreement or offering further legal assurances beyond those agreed in Strasbourg last week.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to hold talks today with European Council president Donald Tusk at Government Buildings. “The meeting is an opportunity to discuss Brexit and other important issues on the EU agenda, ahead of the European Council meeting in Brussels later this week,” a spokesman said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: ReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May will ask the European Union to delay Brexit by at least three months after her plans for another vote on her twice-defeated orce deal were thrown into crisis by a surprise intervention by the Speaker of the House of Commons.Nearly three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, its departure is uncertain and Mrs May’s plans are in disarray. Possible outcomes still range from a long postponement, leaving with Mrs May’s deal, a disruptive exit without a deal, or even another referendum.Just 10 days before the March 29th exit date that Mrs May set two years ago by submitting a formal “Article 50” request to leave - and two days before a crucial EU summit - she was on Tuesday writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a delay, her spokesman confirmed.It was not immediately clear how long a delay she would seek. She had warned parliament that if it did not ratify her deal, she would ask to delay Brexit beyond June 30th, a step that Brexiteers fear would endanger Brexit itself.Other EU member states were discussing two main options: a delay of two to three months, if Mrs May persuades them she can clinch a deal at home, or much longer if she accepts that radical reworking is needed.The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the prime minister would ask for an extension until June 30th - which could give her another chance to get parliament to bless her deal - with the option of a delay of up to two years.CrisisIn a move that added to the sense of crisis in London, speaker John Bercow ruled on Monday that Mrs May’s Brexit deal had to be substantially different to be voted on again by parliament.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said a vote this week on the deal was now less likely. But ministers were studying options, and he indicated the government still planned a third vote. “This is a moment of crisis for our country,” he said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said: “I will fight until the last minute of the time to March 29th for an orderly exit. We haven’t got a lot of time for that.”Her foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “If more time is needed, it’s always better to do another round than a no-deal Brexit.”If it left this way, Britain would quit the EU’s single market and customs union overnight, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that could mean many import and export tariffs. It would face the prospect of manufacturing and financial market disruption, sharp economic contraction and border delays..But France was more blunt, saying a no-deal exit was possible. “Grant an extension - what for? Time is not a solution, it’s a method,” said EU Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau. “If there is an objective and a strategy, it has to come from London.”Mr Bercow said his ruling, based on a convention dating back to 1604, did not prevent the government reshaping its proposition, or securing a vote in parliament to override his ruling. - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The shares debuted at 164p and rapidly added a pound of weight, before swiftly losing it, and a lot more, in a manner that would have some of its 20 something shoppers going green with envy.\u0026nbspA couple of profit warnings in quick succession will do that to you.JD Sports to buy Footasylum in £90m dealJD Sports weathers high street storm with sales growthThe company blamed tough conditions on the high street and delayed openings for a plunge into the red at the half year stage (£4m loss before tax compared with profit of £2.3m in the previous interims).Another alert followed in a January trading statement.They left the company looking like a mid morning snack for someone like Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley.\u0026nbspCowgill had, however, taken note and a month later was sitting on an 18.7 per cent stake enough to make Ashley’s life difficult should he have taken an interest in between butting heads with the Debenhams board, its lenders, and just about everybody else.\u0026nbspNow JD, which had said it didn’t plan to make an offer not that anyone’s really complaining today, is proposing to buy the rest of the shares for 82.5p, which is\u0026nbspa better result than some of those who bought in before Footasylum\u0026nbsptripped up\u0026nbsphad any right to expect.\u0026nbspThe purchase price is more than 80 per cent above\u0026nbspthe level at which the bombed out shares closed out Friday. It is also a lot higher than the prices (50p to 75p) JD paid to build up its existing stake.According to Edison Research, Cowgill\u0026nbspis paying a multiple of 30 times forecast earnings for the year to February 2019, 16 times the following year’s profits.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

There\u0027s a reason its rivals have opted to take their regulatory medicine. It really isn’t doing itself any favours by engaging in a fight like this.\u0026nbspAnother problem with the attention that has been given to the company, and its business practices, is that it’s rather detracted form the other important points the committee has made about live music, which makes a hugely important contribution to the UK’s cultural and its economic life.\u0026nbspIt is an industry that employs 28,000 people, and generated almost £1n in terms of gross value added in 2017, a year in which 29.1m people attended concerns and festivals in the UK.\u0026nbspLooked at in those terms, it is a stunning success. But all is not rosy in its garden and its problems go far beyond people buying tickets from secondary websites and getting fleeced.\u0026nbspThe report highlights numerous issues. Venues have been closing, especially smaller ones. The way in which the benefits of live music are shared around the country is distinctly uneven. In terms of gross spend, for example, the North East generated £51m, compared to £194m in the Midlands, compared to more than £1bn in London.\u0026nbspDespite this the capital has fewer arenas per person than do other major cities and one witnessed stated that it is “trending down” with respect to its international rivals.\u0026nbspThe industry is dogged by competition issues and conflicts of interests that Tom Gray, from the band Gomez, pointed out “would not be tolerated in any other industry”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker (productivity) is falling.If a fall in productivity - the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour - was to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefitting from earning a wage, he said.\u0026nbspBy backing the Government’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Even the simplest migration can run into hurdles and the consequences for the business can be severe, hampering customer experience, reputation and ultimately revenue.Facebook at 15: How Mark Zuckerberg took over the internetData migration is sometimes the only option, according to Mr Taylor, in order for a business to catch up with the rapid advancement of technology, though was unable to point to the exact reason for the migration.It has led some to question MySpace\u0027s public narrative, with some suggesting the lost music is the result of trying to get rid of the cost of hosting the files.I\u0027m deeply\u0026nbspskeptical\u0026nbspthis was an accident, Andy Baio, the former chief technology officer of Kickstarter, tweeted.

It follows Kit (Larson), a twenty-something dreamer who receives an invitation that will fulfill her childhood dreams.Created with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.It’s also a big month for the classics as Ridley Scott epic Gladiator and Steven Spielberg’s original Jurassic Park trilogy will all be available to stream.You can find the full list of every movie and TV show joining Netflix below.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: Part 2\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPart 2 finds Sabrina exploring her darker side, curious to learn more about her heritage, while struggling to maintain her friendships in the mortal world.

This would have happened irrespective of John Bercow\u0027s dramatic intervention in parliament to start the week.There has been some speculation that the EU could decide not to permit\u0026nbspan extension, either collectively or because some members are not keen.Do inidual EU leaders have the power to veto Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsprequest for more time?Yes – because any extension has to be unanimously agreed by all 27 other EU member states, any one of them dissenting could block it.

Could populists like Italy’s Matteo Salvini or Poland’s Law and Justice party block an extension? Some Brexiteers – who don’t want Brexit to be delayed – have asked sympathetic EU leaders to prevent\u0026nbspthe Article 50 period from being extended.Bercow’s Brexit ruling is mistaken, but May’s deal is doomed anywayIn January, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski formally asked the Polish government to block any delay. This doesn’t appear to have been taken seriously by Poland and no response has been given.More recently, this month leading Brexiteers Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore visited Italy. Shortly after, Mr Wigmore said it was “time for Matteo Salvini to help us and veto an extension”.This led some Remain campaigners to suggest there was a plot afoot to block a delay. Mr Salvini – who is notably Italy’s interior minister, not its prime minister, and so has no personal vote – has had his\u0026nbspown battles with Brussels and is\u0026nbspsuspected to be sympathetic.A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate mindsNotably, many Brexiteers themselves don’t appear to believe it\u0026nbspwill happen.“They won\u0027t, there\u0027s no hope of us getting a veto, they\u0027re not going to spend their political capital in the EU on a country that is about to Leave,” Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg said on LBC radio on Monday.Does anyone else have cause to veto an extension? A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate minds. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron has said any extension would have to have a “clear objective” and be based on “a new choice” by the British.Michel Barnier summarised their position\u0026nbsplast week: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.”But really, nobody can be certain what will happen until late on Thursday.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

pushing the country towards what Sir James Bevan referred to as the “jaws of death”.At this point, unless urgent action is taken, there will not be enough water remaining to supply basic needs to the population.Global warming is a major problem, bringing hotter and drier summers to the UK like the one experienced last year.According to Sir James, water companies have identified this as the biggest

time to avoid it. But we need to change our attitudes to wasting water,” said Sir James.The Environment Agency chief is set to deliver this message at a speech to the Waterwise conference in London.Stop flushing Yorkshire puddings down the toilet, water company pleadsBesides significant action by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James is warning that the public must also play a role in tackling this growing threat.“In the last few decades we’ve radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them). In the last two years we’ve changed behaviour on plastic,” he will say.“We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea.“We need everyone to take responsibility for their own water usage.”The Environment Agency previously warned that water shortages may affect people by 2050, and the government has suggested efforts must be made to cut people’s water use.However, an official report also found that enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people in an average day is lost through leakages in the system.Preventing these leaks, as well as larger reservoirs and desalination plants, were all suggested by Sir James as\u0026nbspmethods to prevent the impending catastrophe.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We need something new because if it’s an extension to remain in the same deadlock, how do we get out of this? The British have to come with an initiative that is clear and credible and supported by a majority,” the French minister told reporters on her way into a meeting of ministers in Brussels.Arriving at the same\u0026nbspmeeting Mr Roth added: “We’re really exhausted by these negotiations and\u0026nbspI expect clear and\u0026nbspprecise proposals of UK government\u0026nbspwhy an extension is necessary. It’s not just a game. It’s an extremely serious situation not just for people in UK but also for the people in EU.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?“For my Government it’s the key priority to prevent a no-deal Brexit. I don’t have any appetite for substance-less, very abstract discussions and negotiations on Brexit. Please deliver, dear friends in London please deliver. The clock is ticking.”Ms May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet with the 27 other EU leaders, after parliament approved an extension to Article 50 – which would delay Brexit past 29 March. Under EU treaties, such\u0026nbspan extension must be approved unanimously by all 27 other member states – meaning each one has an effective power of veto.Speaking on Tuesday after meeting EU27 ministers chief negotiator Michel Barnier said leaders would have to assess what is in the best interests of the bloc before making a decision.“I am here to ask a very legitimate question on behalf of the European authorities –\u0026nbspwhich is why do you want an extension? What for? what’s the objective of an extension? What use would it be? An extension has to be useful,” he said.“Does an extension increase the chances of ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?”He added: “What would be the purpose and outcome? And how can we ensure that, at the end of a possible extension, we are not back in the same situation as today?”Mr Barnier warned that “extending uncertainty without a clear plan” would have political and economic costs for the EU, and that a longer extension needed to be linked to something – such as a new political process in the UK to find a solution to the deadlock.The comments by the French and German ministers are the latest expression of frustration from EU leaders at Britain’s approach to talks, which is seen in Brussels and elsewhere on the continent as erratic, poorly-planned, and ided.\u0026nbspOn Sunday Ms Loiseau\u0026nbspjoked in an interview with the French press that she had nicknamed her pet cat “Brexit” because of the way in which it meowed loudly to leave the house but then stood there when she opened the door.Created with Sketch.Dogs rallied in Brexit protest  Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of protesters gathered with their dogs for the \u0027Brexit is a Dog\u0027s Dinner\u0027 rally near Parliament in Westminster on Sunday 10 March 2019.

If the UK does not get an extension it will either have to pass the Brexit deal, revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit, or leave without a deal – with the latter option expected to cause economic chaos.\u0026nbspTheresa May has been criticised by EU leaders before for failing to turn up to meetings in Brussels without clear and precise technical demands. At a summit in December Ms May was reportedly as “what exactly is it that you want?” by German chancellor Angela Merkel, while she pleaded for assistance to pass her Brexit deal but could not spell out exactly what measures she wanted.We’ll tell you what’s true.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

German Europe minister Michel Roth said European countries were “really exhausted” with the saga over Britain’s departure from the EU and and demanded “clear and precise” proposals from the UK government.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the\u0026nbspliveblog\u0026nbspto load...May to force third vote on Brexit deal in defiance of Bercow, cabinet minister saysEU countries \u0027really exhausted\u0027 by UK, Germany says amid warning to Theresa May\u0027Don\u0027t involve the Queen\u0027, Stephen Barclay says as he confirms he will not step down\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn to meet with opposition leaders to discuss Brexit\u0026nbspA bit more from Michel Barnier\u0027s press conference\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBrussels. He says:\u0026nbspThe EU authorities want to know what the underlying political process which would be the grounds for that extension would be - political process within the House of Commons or in the general political debate in the UK.It is our duty to ask whether this extension would be useful because an extension will be something which would extend uncertainty and uncertainty costs.Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, is now speaking in Brussels. He says that, before agreeing to delay Brexit, EU countries will need answers to several questions:\u0026nbsp\tDoes an extension increase the chances of the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbspbeing ratified?\tDoes the UK want to rework the political declaration on the future relationship?\tIf not, what would be the purpose and the outcome of an extension?\u0026nbspHe says answers will be needed to reassure the EU that, at the end of the extension, we are not back in the same situation as today.This just in from a Labour Party spokesperson:\u0026nbspThis afternoon, Jeremy Corbyn held constructive talks with Ian Blackford, Vince Cable, Liz Saville Roberts and Caroline Lucas about breaking the current Brexit deadlock. The party leaders affirmed their common opposition to the government\u0027s botched deal or a no deal outcome.Should there not be a majority in parliament for May\u0027s deal or a public vote, Corbyn called on the other parties to engage constructively to find a parliamentary majority for a close economic relationship with the EU that can work for the whole country.The party leaders discussed efforts to ensure May\u0027s deal would be put to a public vote if she is able to force it through parliament with threats and phony bribes.BREAKING: Yellow Vest protesters have broken into the office of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThey are claiming that requests for a meeting over the deaths of three teenage boys have been ignored.The protest relates to the case of Jaynesh Chudasama, who was jailed last year over the deaths by dangerous driving of three boys as they walked to a 16th birthday party.The protesters, numbering around 20, sung\u0026nbspjustice for the three and chanted we want a new attorney general, while one man held an England flag aloft.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Irish premier has held Brexit talks with European Council president Donald Tusk in Dublin.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed Mr Tusk on Tuesday morning in front of the media, but neither of the men made any reply when questioned by journalists.When asked if Monday\u0027s Westminster news posed a problem, Mr Tusk did not reply but shrugged.The Dublin meeting was to consider any requests from the UK to delay Brexit, and other issues on the EU agenda, ahead of the European Council meeting in Brussels later this week.A joint statement after the meeting said they discussed the current state of play regarding Brexit.President Tusk expressed the strong and ongoing solidarity with Ireland of the European Council and European leaders, the statement read.They agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.Meanwhile, preparations continue in Ireland and across the European Union for a no-deal scenario, which would have serious consequences for all concerned.BREAKING: Vote Leave has been fined £40,000 for sending thousands of unsolicited text messages during the EU referendum campaign\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere was a full discussion of John Bercow\u0027s ruling yesterday at this morning\u0027s\u0026nbspcabinet meeting, Theresa May\u0027s spokesman has said.\u0026nbspSpeaking at the regular briefing for Westminster journalists, he insisted there was still \u0026nbspan absolute determination to find a way to get Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal through parliament.\u0026nbspOf the cabinet meeting, he said:\u0026nbspThey had a full discussion which covered both the implications of the speaker\u0027s comments yesterday and the upcoming European Council.Ms May is expected to write to European Council president Donald Tusk today or tomorrow\u0026nbspahead of the summit in Brussels on Thursday.\u0026nbspGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will fight until the final hour to secure Brexit by 29 March.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe told Bloomberg:\u0026nbspThe agreement was supplemented just a few days ago, I think substantially, because the wish was for something legally binding with regard to the backstop. I will fight until the final hour of the deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspthat we have an orderly exit.\u0026nbspCommenting on John Bercow\u0027s ruling yesterday, she added:I must confess that I was not familiar with the rules of order of the British parliament from the 17th Century.Interestingly, she refused to say that she supported an extension of\u0026nbspArticle 50, insisting that\u0026nbspit depended on what Theresa May asks for...It comes as it was revealed that\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspis set to push forward with her plans for a third\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote despite the Commons speaker dealing a major blow to her plans.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspBercow\u0026nbspruled on Monday that Ms May’s EU withdrawal agreement will have to be substantially different from the package that was decisively defeated last week, if another vote is to go ahead.The ruling, announced in an unexpected statement to the Commons, is a further obstacle in\u0026nbspMs May’s attempts to get a deal agreed by the scheduled Brexit date\u0026nbspof 29 March.A government source said it seemed\u0026nbsp”clear that the Speaker’s motive here is to rule out a meaningful vote this week which also stands in the way of a securing a shorter extension.“(This) leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.“But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken – the Speaker wouldn’t have done it if it did.”Solicitor general Robert Buckland said the government was facing a “major constitutional crisis” and that Mr Bercow’s intervention would have “huge reverberations” for the Brexit process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What the chancellor isn’t allowed to say is that what he’s really talking about is a negative idend from not having a deal,” Mr Johnson said.Economists have also cast doubt on whether the chancellor has a potential war chest of £26.6bn, as he has argued.The figure depends on him abandoning his longstanding target of balancing the books by the mid 2020s, it is argued.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker (productivity) is falling.If a fall in productivity - the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour - was to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefitting from earning a wage, he said.\u0026nbspBy backing the Government’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control. So please stay out of this area and stay off local roads if possible.”Created with Sketch.\u0027Super bloom\u0027 covers US desert in bright flowers: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Poppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaLocal media said as many as 50,000 people visited the poppy fields over the weekend – a figure that was twice that of the weekend before. Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice president with a reputation for veering off script?In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party on Saturday, Mr Biden boasted he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.”The only problem is Mr Biden has not announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.Although Mr Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe – a case of accidentally telling the truth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

This led other cities across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, to develop tactile paving in the following years.Seiichi Miyake\u0026nbspinvented tactile paving, also known as tenji blocksHowever, it was not until the 1990s that Miyake’s invention became commonplace in western countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The most common types of tactile paving include raised lines or domes. The former design indicates that it is safe to walk on a particular path, while the latter acts as a ‘stop’ sign to alert users to potential dangers.Created with Sketch.

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator. A crowd-funding page set up to help pay for any legal fees he may face has raised almost 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,000). The page initially said: “Money raised will go to EggBoi for: Legal fees. More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK. But it’s not just blokes. A fth of adolescent girls say they have self-harmed, a path to more serious acts later in le.Britain has come a long way in recent years on mental health. But those statistics show there is plenty of work to do. We’re thrilled to launch our Let’s Talk campaign with Papyrus to do our bit.The pressures of modern le are even more pressing for those who are thrust suddenly into the spotlight.That’s the lesson not just of today’s news but of Love Island star Sophie Gradon’s death last year.The companies that make millions off these young men and women have a duty of care to them. It’s clear from the criticism we’ve seen since Mike’s untimely death that those outfits MUST take their responsibilities more seriously.Chloe Goodman knows better than most. And we back her call for mandatory counselling for reality stars.This tragedy must be the last.FACEBOOK are asking for our gratitude after eventually taking down videos of the horric terrorist attack in Christchurch.Which doesn’t change the fact it took far too long for them to do so, nor that it was streamed in the first place.It is ridiculous that these s continue to dodge the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, even though boss Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that that is exactly what they are.The Government MUST step in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

I told Stephen Parkinson I won’t budge on it when he arranged the phone call yesterday. I think she rang me as a last ditch effort.

You can have the same motion but where the circumstances have changed.Other options he discussed to make the motion dferent were attaching the Article  extension to it, or some changes on Northern Ireland guarantees that are being thrashed out with the DUP at the moment, he suggested.Last night Westminster was ided on what the latest dramatic turn meant for Brexit.Brexiteer James Gray told Newsnight: “It’s my view that this ruling by Mr Speaker Bercow will mean that Britain will not now leave the European Union at all.Veteran Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke accused the Speaker - who has admitted he voted Remain - of trying to kill Brexit.Today the PMs spokesperson said that Britain was essentially now in crisis over the deadlock.They admitted: If you look back at the speech the PM gave just before MV, thatMPs don’t support MV we would be in crisis, I think events yesterday tell you that has come to pass.The little known precedent — used just  times, the last in  — bans the Government from asking MPs to vote on the same motion more than once in a parliamentary session.It was drawn up after King James interfered in the Sherf of Buckinghamshire’s election — by demanding a second vote, so his candidate could be elected.Mr Bercow, whose we had a B****cks to Brexit sticker on her car, wants to use the delay to try and keep us in the EU, other critics argued.Meanwhile Remainers in Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP pushing for a People’s Vote lavished praise on the Speaker.A Government source said: “It seems clear that the Speaker’s motive here is to rule out a Meaningful Vote this week, which also stands in the way of securing a shorter extension.“It leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.“But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken — the Speaker wouldn’t have done itit did.”The PM is set to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to Article  this week.Shell demand a short extensionshe gets the deal through in the coming days, but could be forced into a long one of monthsshe doesnt.After Speaker Bercows bombshell intervention that the PM cant bring back the same vote to the Commons again, it was rumoured that the Government could ask the Queen to end the current Parliamentary session and start a new one.Theres a rule which means the same motion can only be voted on once in each Parliament.If its dferent, ora new session is started, then it can come back for a new vote.But this morning Stephen Barclay vowed to keep the Royals out of it.He told Sky: One thing I think everyone would agree on is involving Her Majesty is not the right option.And he insisted that the best way for MPs to end the Brexit impasse is to vote for the current deal and get it through. Meanwhile, hardline Tories threatened to go on strikethe PM carries out her vow to delay Brexit by a year.As many as  members of the European Research Group have told whips they will carry out “vote strikes” - a move that would push Mrs May’s minority government to the verge of collapse.As Conservative tensions over Brexit reached boiling point around the PM’s ultimatum strategy, one senior Tory backbencher told The Sun: “If she tried to go ahead with a long extension, there will be vote strikes on all Government legislation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004769238291.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow brexit bbc interview","story":"The Commons Speaker made a string of sarcastic jokes when he was approached by the BBC this morning.He ignored repeated questions about his controversial move to stop Theresa May holding a third vote on his Brexit deal.Mr Bercow was filmed walking to work in Parliament and asked: Can you explain to the public what you did yesterday But instead of responding, he said, I really feel you ought to get yourselves some coffee or tea - then made a joke about the reporters hat.Pressed on the issue, the Speaker sneered: Im sure people are so very grateful to you for showing such interest at this time in the morning - very grateful to you, very well done.As the camera crew crossed the road with him, Mr Bercow snapped: Careful, careful!

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must not lose sight of the fact the fault lies at the door of No. Mrs May wasted months not knowing what she wanted from Brexit, and then found she could not persuade enough Conservative and DUP MPs to endorse the flawed deal she brought back from Brussels. Humiliated May is a PM without power. Without credit Desperate women, driven by welfare cuts to sell their bodies for sex, would be a Government crime against decency.

Tory austerity, including social security cuts, is ruining lives. The poor, low-paid, middle-earners and disabled are denied dignity when Tories treat them like expensive nuisances.    If Universal Credit is seeing short-changed claimants selling sex, this would be the most obscene Government in history.

Raufaposs we Shahida Abid, , and her best friend Saima Hayat, , who was married to the murder victim, were each ordered to serve at least  years and six months in prison before being eligible for parole. They were convicted of murdering the -year-old security guard at a flat in Castlemilk, Glasgow, on April  last year, as eight children slept.    Judge Lady Rae at the High Court in Glasgow told them: You have been convicted of the brutal murder of a defenceless man who was at the start of this assault probably asleep. This was a sustained, relentless and merciless attack with lethal weapons. From the chilling recording the jury heard of the noise within the flat it is clear this attack lasted in excess of six minutes. The injuries were so extensive it was dficult to count them.” Rauf smashed Haider at least  times on the head with a hammer and then slashed his throat  times with a kne. Lady Rae said: The neck injuries were probably inflicted when he was actually dying.    The plan to murder Haider was hatched by his we Shahida Abid, who was described by Lady Rae as “manipulative and scheming”, and her friend Saima Hayat. It was carried out by Rauf. Haider was dead by am, but his killers did not call the police until am. They found the two women tied up with tape. The woman claimed three intruders and Haider had tied up the women before injecting them and eight children with chemicals. It was claimed that Rauf had saved them all by killing Haider. The women and children were taken to hospital in a fleet of eight ambulance, but doctors discovered there was nothing wrong with any of them. Their plan began to unravel when police discovered that a neighbour had recorded the sounds of the brutal killing after being wakened at am by thumping. Detectives also discovered every room in the flat had CCTV cameras installed. When they examined footage taken in the living room shortly before the murder which showed Abid making a cut-throat gesture and Hayat a stabbing motion to both eyes and her stomach. The CCTV system was switched off minutes before the murder. Haider suffered multiple fractures to his skull, as well as a broken jaw and cheekbone and his neck was slashed. In evidence it was revealed Rauf said Haider made offensive remarks about his we and mother and he snapped. He said: I was very angry. I donapost know what happened how many times I struck him. When I came back to my senses I was on top of him, my hand was on his mouth and there was blood everywhere. Neither Abid or Hayat gave evidence and they continue to insist they are innocent. During the trial it was alleged that Hayat had to flee from the family home in Warrington, England, because Haider beat her, but Lady Rae yesterday told her: I am satisfied that you were the abusive partner and not your husband.

At the Waterwise conference in London yesterday, he urged Britons to cut water usage, insisting that wasting water must now become as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea. He also demanded water companies urgently fix leaks, build new desalination plants and reservoirs in order to combat Englandaposs growing water crisis.“Water companies all identy the same thing as their biggest operating risk: climate change , Sir James added.   By , the UKaposs population is expected to rise from  million to  million, drastically increasing the demand for water. Clean water supplies are expected to be reduced because of the effects of climate change with hotter and drier summer months, less rainfall and higher risk of droughts. Wildle habitats that rely on bodies of water will also be affected, including species such as trout, otters and kingfishers, that are already under threat from increasing demands for drinking water.    Unless we all act to reduce water use and wastage, in a few decadesapos time there will not be enough clean water, Sir James continued. Demand for water will rise as the population grows, whilst water supply is likely to reduce as the effects of climate change kick in. Around  years from now, where those two lines cross is known by some as the jaws of death - the point at which we will not have enough water to supply our needs, unless we take action to change things. We can foresee this moment and there is still time to avoid it. But we need to change our attitudes to wasting water so it becomes as socially unacceptable as throwing your plastic bags into the sea.    We need to use less water and use it more efficiently. The average person must cut their water intake from  litres a day to  litres in order to reverse the threat of water shortage, explaining how more than a third is lost through waste and leakage. He also said more desalination plants must be installed, such as Thames Wateraposs Beckton plant, turning saltwater into drinkable fresh water without taking away from the environment. Building reservoirs is a necessary step to increase water supplies, but they are controversial because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so dficult and local opposition so fierce, Sir James added.

Lee Taylor, , allegedly drove into teenagers like skittles in a bowling alley when banter spilled into violence. He is accused of driving a BMW dangerously and injuring the young people after a game, which his team lost -. Newport Crown Court heard it happened shortly before pm on Thursday, April  last year, Wales Online reports. Prosecutor Christopher Rees said Taylor used his car as a weapon to drive at a group of young people and “mowed them down like skittles in a bowling alley” in a terrying incident. Taylor denies dangerous driving and  counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm as well as alternatives of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Jurors were shown pictures of the scene, and told that the BMW suffered a damaged windscreen and lost a wing mirror in the incident. The young people who were injured in the incident cannot be named for legal reasons. Pictures of injuries to some of the alleged victims were also shown to the court.  Mr Rees said: “The prosecution bring the case, the prosecution have to prove the case. “The prosecution case is that at pm on April , Cornelly Football Club were hosting a match against Margam Football Club. “The defendant Lee Taylor was playing in the football match for Margam. “There were around  to  spectators at the game, most of them young persons.” The court heard one spectator was “giving out banter” to the Margam players. Afterwards a group of young people began to congregate around the changing room. Mr Rees said there was “banter” which provoked one of the young people. “The confrontation was looking like it might escalate towards something more serious, a fight,” said the prosecutor. The court heard Taylor walked back to him BMW, got into the car and reversed out of his parking space. Mr Rees said there were school children in the area. He added: “The prosecution say Taylor got into his car, pointed the nose of the vehicle at the group of young persons, revved and raced his engine, his wheels spun, and drove at speed [towards them].” Mr Rees said he “mowed them down like skittles in a bowling alley”. He added: “It was, the prosecution say, a terrying incident.” One boy described the car’s “wheels spinning” and “engine racing”. The impact caused him to fall backwards ft. Another alleged victim “heard screaming” and “saw the BMW coming directly at him”. Mr Rees said: “He closed his eyes at this point. He felt his body make contact with the grass floor.” The court heard some complainants went on to the bonnet of the car. One teen said he was “scared and speechless”. Another was struck by the car, “causing him to be lted off his feet”. The court heard his face hit the windscreen. Mr Rees said a witness described the scene as “carnage”.  The youngest complainant, aged , said he was “frozen in fear” and “thought he was going to die”. Mr Rees said: “He was lying face down on the bonnet.” The prosecutor said a -year-old girl witnessed the incident, stating: “She saw a group of boys being struck. She was able to record the aftermath of it.” A dog walker saw the car “ploughing into” the group, jurors were told, and mobile phone footage was shown to the court. The court heard there was “a fight” and the defendant used his thumb to “gouge” a complainant’s eye. Prosecutors said Taylor then drove away “at speed”. Police attended the scene at around pm, and went to the Sandfields area of Port Talbot, where Taylor lived. The defendant allegedly told officers: “I wasn’t going to stay and take a kicking.” Mr Rees said the complainants attended hospital and added: “It is by sheer good fortune that the injuries were not more serious than they were.” In his police interview Taylor said he was playing for Margam.  He said he was called “fatty” by one of the boys. Taylor said a youth jumped on his car and said he thought he was going “to get a kicking”. Mr Rees said his account was very dferent from the accounts of the witnesses. The defendant was shown the mobile phone footage and said he did not remember a second “scuffle”. Mr Rees said: “He drove deliberately at these boys.” “The prosecution say the defendant got into his car to drive at the group because he had lost his temper. “He knocked them down like skittles. The prosecution say the defendant is responsible for driving at these young men deliberately.” An -year-old - who was  at the time - said he overheard the defendant say “I’ll eat you, you little c***” to another complainant. He said he was struck by the car in the thigh area, stating: It sort of bounced me on to the floor. I sort of slid across the floor. He said he started apospunchingapos the passenger window, telling the court: He was using the car as a weapon. I wanted to stop him hurting anyone . And describing the attack on him, the teenager said: He approached me. I was down into a headlock. He was gouging my eye. He had his thumb and he was gouging my eye. The court heard police and ambulance attended the scene. the -year-old said he later went to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Asked about his injuries he said: “I broke my hand. Bruising on my arm, my leg. I had a little lump on my eye.” The jury were shown photographs of his injuries taken by the police. The witness said: “You can see just under my right eye, there’s a bit of a lump, a swelling.” He also suffered grazing and scratching to the back of his leg. The witness said the car hit him to his leg. The teenager told the court he got an injury to his hand by punching the car window. Nicola Powell, for Taylor, suggested some people there “wanted his [Taylor’s] blood”. The teenager disagreed. Ms Powell asked: “I’m right in saying it all kicked off, didn’t it ” The witness replied: “Not necessarily.” Ms Powell suggested one of the complainants “had a score to settle” and was “egged on”. The witness responded: “Not really.” Ms Powell suggested her client was trying to make sure there was “a fair fight”. The teenager replied: “He got involved with straight threats.” Ms Powell suggested some iniduals followed him in the car park, but the witness said that was not the case. The teen said the defendant’s car went on to the grass after hitting him. Ms Powell confirmed her client accepts that his car went on to the playing field briefly to turn around a parked car. The teenager said two iniduals had to run down a lane to get away from the BMW. He said the defendant was “chasing” them. Ms Powell suggested there was “a lot of confusion” and asked the witnesshe could have misinterpreted the defendant’s actions as “chasing”. The witness said he did not believe he had misinterpreted the situation. He agreed the incident happened very quickly and was over in “a couple of minutes”. Ms Powell then suggested her client’s car was “surrounded” by youths. The teeanger said that was not the case. Questioned about what happened to the BMW’s wing mirror, he replied: “I did not see anyone do anything to the wing mirror.” The trial continues.

I still can’t quite believe itaposs all thanks to a £. moisturiser for babies.” Francesca, who has a son, Charlie, six, with her steel worker husband Chris, , told how the first signs of dermatitis sprang up around five years ago when she started itching between her fingers.  At first she thought little of it, assuming it was simply a reaction to exposing her hands to water and chemicals, like those in hair dye, at work. But over the ensuring three weeks her symptoms worsened - with over-the-counter products making no dference. So, after consulting her GP,  she was referred to a dermatologist at Lincolnshireaposs Scunthorpe General Hospital. “I was prescribed a steroid cream, which worked for a while, but then my skin almost got used to it and the symptoms flared up again,” she said. “So, I was given a dferent type of steroid cream, which I’d apply every night and bandage up my hands to keep the moisture in. “But it soon stopped working again and we were back at square one. That rigmarole of going back and forth carried on for years.”  At her lowest ebb, Francesca even had daily sessions of phototherapy, which involves using UV light to treat a range of skin conditions. It made no dference. Eventually, doctors warned her thatthey could not find something soon to alleviate her symptoms she would have to consider quitting her hairdressing career. Francesca said: I’d been a hairdresser for  years, so I couldn’t just walk away. There had to be something out there that could help.” Meanwhile, as time wore on with no sign of her symptoms improving, Francesca’s self-esteem was in tatters. She said: “I was so self-conscious of my hands. Doing hair meant I couldn’t even cover them up. “If I ever went out, I’d wear a cardigan or jacket I could shove my hands in the pocket of.  “I remember paying for something one day when the cashier demanded to know what was wrong with my hands. I left the shop in tears. “I’m sure she didn’t mean for it to sound nasty, but when you already feel down, a comment like that makes you paranoid that everyone is staring at you.” At the end of her tether Francesca feared she may never find anything to help. Then everything changed last yearwhen a client suggested she tried Childs Farm, a British skincare brand that uses naturally derived ingredients and essential oils. While the products are mainly aimed at newborns, babies and children, Francesca figured that their gentle ingredients would not irritate her skin any further so she gave them a try. And, amazingly, within two weeks of using the £. cream she saw a marked improvement.

But Mohammed said he suffered sad and reckless Islamophobic abuse in two separate incidents yesterday following an event at Regentaposs Park mosque. He said he was called aposdespicableapos and a aposs***holeapos by a man on a bus.

When I asked why - he said it was because I was wearing a dress. And after getting off the bus, he said a cyclist spat at him. It was so sad to see such reckless hate and Islamophobia after the event and after all we have been through this week, Mohammed said.    Leaders of all faiths and backgrounds, the Home Secretary, and the London Mayor came together at the London Central Mosque to stand against hate and show solidarity with Christchurch. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan , who was at the event, tweeted today: The abuse Imam Mahmoud suffered, on his way home from our interfaith event to show solidarity with our friends in Christchurch, is disgusting.Hate crime of any kind has no place in London - and we take a zero-tolerance approach to tackling it.  Mohammed said the event at the London mosque had been aposbeautulapos and aposimportantapos - but he said the incidents he encountered on his way home showed the continuing threat of Islamophobia. The imam is flying to New Zealand today to visit the two mosques that were targeted on Friday. When he s, he told the Evening Standard he would be reporting both incidents to police.

But under the hundred-watt smile, Charlie was mired in darkness, and took his own le in March , before the programme was broadcast. Charlie, a student, was just . He had struggled with his mental health since losing his mother to cancer when he was .His heartbroken twin brother Harry, , has established the Charlie Watkins Foundation to raise awareness about mental health and funds to support young people who are suffering from mental illness.Two years after his death, Harry has written an emotional open letter, published below, about the saddest day of his le and what he would give to see his brother just one more time.   Dear Charlie, It feels strange to write a letter to you now, although it is somewhat therapeutic. I used to think that I knew what you were thinking, yet it is clear to me now that I never truly knew. It is obvious that I did not know of the demons you were battling in your head, or what you were forced to do next. It has been two years since the saddest day of my le.  The day I will never forget, chiselled in my mind like a mason takes to stone, and there it will remain. It serves me not as an infliction of pain, but as a reminder of the work I have to do in your name. Even though you may no longer be with us, your name lives on. The Charlie Watkins Foundation is a symbol, for all those who struggle with the same fight which you so bravely struggled with alone, to show them that there is hope and most importantly, solace.    There is not a day that goes past where I donapost think of you. Watching films we’d seen, eating at restaurants where we’d gone to, and even going to the pub where you so often forgot to take your wallet. What I would give now to buy you one more pint is immeasurable. It is not often someone at the age of  can say that they have lost a brother, furthermore a twin.    It is a connection that is like no other. I constantly feel like there is something missing from my le. I took for granted the bond we shared. I never said I loved you enough or actually admitted you were the quite good-looking brother who had a certain way with words. I lived in awe of your speedy wit and ability to understand a joke a lot quicker than me. I still replay some of your jokes in my head, having a private laugh every now and then.    To be honest, I still donapost quite understand one or two of them. Then again, we always knew who the smarter brother was. Upon undertaking work for the Charlie Watkins Foundation, it became clear that there was a problem out there, and not a small one either. I hadnapost realised that suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of . How did I not know this  I assumed it was potentially my ignorance, but upon further investigation and talking to friends I realised that they too were none the wiser.  Why is there such a stigma surrounding mental health  If it was cancer or dementia, Iaposm sure everyone would be talking about it. This brought us, the foundation, to one of our key questions and goals. How do we get people to talk about mental health without being scared to do so  This is why we designed Chat with Charlie in your name. It is an online chat-room. A place where students can turn when they are struggling. Hopefully we will be able to spread this nationwide, helping as many as possible. If only there was something like this for you when you were suffering. Charlie, I will never forget you but will learn to cope with living without you. I will carry your memory with me always, as I do with mumaposs. I so often think about what you would be doing now.    What job you would have, where you would live, and what beautul girlfriend you would no doubt have. Sadly though, these are things I will have to leave to the imagination. Take happiness darling brother, knowing that there is always a place in my heart for you to reside, as I know the case to be true with so many others. I wish you eternal love and peace.

When he was just a child he lost both parents to the disease in the s. Lennyaposs father was a drug addict and became infected when he used unclean needles. He passed the virus onto Lennyaposs mum and when he was still a boy AIDs had claimed the lives of both his parents. Lenny has opened up in a hard hitting BBC Three documentary The Man Who Used HIV As A Weapon looking at the devastating actions of aposHIV hairdressrapos Daryll Rowe.    Daryll was the first person to be convicted in the UK for deliberately infecting partners with HIV. Lenny said: My dad was a junkie, contracted HIV through needles and passed it on to my mum. It was a death sentence then - I knew that they were both going to die. Because of his traumatic childhood, Lenny was always extremely careful and cautious when it came to safe sex. He met Daryll in October  in Brighton.    Daryll was already on the run from police in Scotland and had switched phones, left no forwarding address and changed his bank acount. Back in April  he had been diagnosed with HIV. But rather than face the health consequences, he posted clips to his YouTube channel about health living and rejected traditional treatment, instead believing that drinking his own urine would keep him healthy. And this is when his disturbing, deliberate and potentially deadly pattern of sexual behaviour began. Daryll targeted his victims, messaging them online and arranging to meet up for sex on the gay dating app, Grindr.  He would then either refuse to wear a condom, take it off mid-sex or deliberately sabotage it, making it useless. It was part of a revenge plt on the gay community following his own diagnosis. And once the act had been committed he followed it up with chilling text messages, telling his unsuspecting victims that he had infected them with HIV. After fleeing police in Scotland, Darryl continued with the same sick pattern. He contacted Lenny, who swore he would never leave himself vulnerable to catching HIV.  Lenny explained: I grew up saying that never in a million years would I let this happen to me, I never wanted to utter the words that I had HIV.” That choice was taken from him when Daryll sabotaged the condom. Lenny said: I trusted him, I gave him a condom, saw him put it on and what he did with it then I have no idea. Absolutely no idea. But the celebrity make-up artist, who has waived his right to anonymity, was horried when, out of the blue, Dryll sent him a message saying I ripped the condom. I got you. After he was diagnosed, Lenny bravely reported what had happened to the police.  The clinic he was treated in reported that there had been four other similar cases. Daryll was arrested by Sussex Police and was wanted over charges involving seven men. And when officers seized his phone they realised he had been contacting hundreds of men across the country - and issued a public health warning. When he was first intervewed, Daryll told police he didnapost know he was HIV positive - almost a year after his diagnosis. He said: I had a relationship when I first got here and it was unprotected so I’ve not been tested after that. I’m a little bit worried about that.  Daryll was moved back to Scotland under strict bail conditions, part of which included having to start HIV treatment. Living with his foster parents, Jacqui and Harry, near Edinburgh, for three weeks Daryll again went on the run. During the hunt for Daryll, police found a tent filled with medication with his name on it. If Daryll was taking the HIV drugs it meant he was once again infectious. Despite a nation manhunt, Daryll moved to Newcastle and met Tom while using a fake name.  He managed to persuade Tom to let him stay at his house for three months and began to exert terrying control over him. Thankfully Tom tested negative for HIV and Daryll was finally arrested. He had tried to run by jumping out of a first floor window into a neighbouraposs garden but smashed his vertebrae. When Tom ed home he discovered condom packets had been snipped at the corner and the tip of each condom cut off. The police had finally snared Daryll and he became the first person to be convicted of deliberately trying to spread HIV.  He was jailed for le and must serve at least  years. Daryll has also been placed on the sex offenderaposs register for le. Sentencing him at Brighton Crown Court, Judge Christine Henson QC called his crimes a “determined hateful campaign of sly violence.” “The messages you sent make it crystal clear you knew exactly what you were doing.As well as the physical offences, it is clear for the victims the psychological effects are immense.I can’t see how and when you will no longer be a danger to gay men.  This sentence is not about stigmatising anyone living with HIV. Daryll initially refused to accept any responsibility for his actions and even appealed - and list - his conviction. He now admits he was building a really unhealthy relationship with sex, which I need to work on. Daryll told BBC Three: When I got the diagnosis – because I was in so much denial – I had in my mind that I was going to cure myself with urine therapy.I almost used that as an excuse for continuing to have unprotected sex. I thought in my mind, ‘Well this must be blocking it’.  And he claims the vile messages he sent to his victims were simply to get a reaction. Daryll added: I wasn’t coping well when I was rejected by anybody. I think it was building up. The thing I really couldn’t cope with was when I was talking to or dating somebody and then they would just completely ignore me for no reason. The messages came out of that. At that point, it was about HIV. That’s the first thing that came to my head. I thought, ‘This will get a reaction’. It just got out of control. He has also apologised to his victims and says he hopes one day they can forgive him.

Bookies have offs of around   on Royal twins - how exciting! What will the Royal Baby be called  If they follow in Kate and Williamaposs footsteps, the couple will keep us guessing for a few days before they announce the name. Bookies Betway is listing Diana as its favourite with odds sitting at  .  Up next is Victoria at   followed by Alice at   and Elizabeth at  . There two names in the running for boys, with Albert and Phillip both at  . Arthur and James are next, both at  . Will Meghan get maternity leave  Yes. Just like every other mum Meghan is legally entitled to some time off with her baby. Sheaposs already completed her final public engagement - the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey - but sheaposs continuing with private meetings and events. Where will the baby fall in the line of succession  Seventh in line. The baby will bump Harryaposs uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queenaposs youngest son - drops out of the top  for the first time to th in line.    Where is Meghan having the baby  Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Maryaposs Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-lawaposs lead. Harry was also born there in . It is close to Kensington Palace and well practiced at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But many royal expects believe Meghan will pick somewhere dferent to have her baby.    The couple will probably be living in their new Windsor home when the baby arrives, so they may want something a bit closer. Where will the Royal Baby live  Baby Sussex will live at Harry and Meghanaposs new home - Frogmore Cottage. It has undergone a huge renovation ahead ready so make it the perfect family home. How will the baby be related to the Queen  The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Walesaposs grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs niece or nephew.    Will the baby be a prince or princess  No, they will not be a prince nor a princess , nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in . Will he or she ever be monarch  Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.  So what will their title be  A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his fatheraposs other lesser titles as a courtesy title. Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom. A daughter would be LadyMountbatten-Windsor. But the Queen could change this  Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of Georgeaposs birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridgesapos children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.  Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny  Most likely. Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements.

Hayley is one such mum who relies on infant formula to feed her nine-month-old. However, given the cost of formula, a tearful Hayley revealed she has been forced to water it down to ensure it lasts longer.Hayley had tried to breastfeed her babies, but they didnapost take to it.The heartbreaking admission was made to Kate Quilton on Channel aposs Dispatches: The Great Formula Milk Scandal. Whataposs even more troubling about Hayleyaposs situation is that she is by no means alone - experts are worried that watering down formula will become increasingly common.    Hayleyaposs partner earns £, a month, with £ spoken for on bills, which leaves £ which they have to really stretch and be careful with. Some days I just wouldnapost eat. I would let my girls eat, she said. Itaposs heartbreaking to see your baby cry because you canapost afford her milk. She was starving. When asked how she made the formula last, Hayley revealed she added extra water, saying: I just have to make it stretch... Itaposs horrendous. According to the study in the Channel  programme, £. will buy you enough Sainsburyaposs Little Ones formula to last six months.  If you spent the same amount on SMA Pro First Formula, youaposd only get a . month supply. As the most expensive brand, £. worth of Aptamil Profutura Stage  would last . months. The cruel irony is that experts have confirmed all formula brands contain the same essential nutrients, yet the disparity in pricing is huge. Hospitals store formula for new mums who canapost breastfeed, but arenapost allowed to recommend a specic brand. Disturbingly, some healthcare professionals attend training days which are sponsored by certain formula brands.  Itaposs something which Dr Laura de Rooy, a consultant neonatologist at St Georgeaposs Hospital, agreed is not necessarily providing those healthcare professionals with unbiased information. Professor Anthony Costello, a former director at WHO, said: It’s outrageous. If you’re a company and you want to promote your products, you want to reach the people who are most influential. So that will be paediatricians, it will be dietitians, it will be nurses, midwives, health visitors – companies are now right in the NHS , and that is extremely worrying. More worrying, it’s almost co-branding themselves with the NHS and they’re essentially advertising their products, it’s quite confusing for the health workers.  The British Specialist Nutrition Association, a body which represents formula milk brands, said in response: We believe we have a responsibility to provide informationso that they can advise parents about feeding their babies. We are only allowed to make legally approved claims and we believe it is irresponsible to suggest to parents and carers that they cannot trust these.

This is a milestone moment for all parents, but for adoptive mum Paula itaposs extra special. Doctors said that four-year-old Tony may never walk due to the brutal abuse he suffered at the hands of his birth parents. At just  days old, Tony was hours from death after being tortured by Jody Simpson, , and Tony Smith, , who were later jailed.Tony suffered multiple organ failure, numerous fractures and  sepsis  and doctors battled for six weeks to save him.The baby was so badly injured that he later had to have both legs amputated below the knee. But that horror is hard to imagine when you look at the smiling, robust little boy wriggling off his mumaposs lap to try out his new Spiderman-themed prosthetic legs. Here, Paula tells their story in her own words.   I can do it mum, I can do it, Tony says as I try to secure his prosthetics before he wriggles off my knee. Seeing him run on his new legs now towards the playground, it’s hard to imagine how close to death he was less than four years ago. He was such a broken little boy when I first met him in hospital. My husband Mark and I were looking to foster a child at the time so we went to see Tony. We were told that he had been poorly but when nurses showed me photos of his injuries I just broke down and cried.  The injuries were horric, his whole body was bruised and he had a hole in his nose. I sat down by his hospital bed and when he opened his eyes he just melted my heart. I rang my husband and said, aposthis is not going to be easy, itaposs going to be a lot of work and our family will never be the same again. But I canapost leave him. When we took him home two days later he looked so fragile in his little car seat. I thought aposwhat have we done bringing such a poorly little boy into our boisterous family apos  But we never wrapped Tony up in cotton wool and he just got on with things. His progress has been incredible. He is proof that all a child needs is love and care to thrive. Nothing stops him now. He’s really fast getting around and he’s caught up cognitively with all his peers. He is very determined. The strength of his will has pulled him through. And these new prosthetics will hopefully be the start of his next phase of growth. Heaposs never been able to walk so we didnapost know how stable he would be.  But he mastered that walking action very quickly so we remain optimistic. Tonyaposs bones are still in a mess after the abuse he suffered. One leg is shorter than the other and when you see him next to other children you really notice how short his thigh bones are. But heaposs using his legs really nicely so weaposre keeping everything crossed. Doctors said that Tony was born in the right era. Medicine and technology are progressing all the time.  In  years, Tony will be , and there should be amazing advancements in prosthetics by then. Theyaposve designed these prosthetics specially for him in Luton. Theyaposre broader at the bottom so theyaposre very stable and have anti-slip rubber on the soles to make it easier for him to learn. Tony loves the playground but he usually has to go down the slide head first. He can tip overhe goes legs-first because all his weight and strength are in his top half but now he can do it with the prosthetics.    The old prosthetics were cumbersome. These have additional layers of lycra which hold his skin more tightly. And heaposll be able to pull up the shorts that attach to the legs on his own. He likes pirates, so he has another pair being sent next week with a skull and cross bones printed on them. Practicing on the prosthetics can be hard work. Heaposs so fast getting around without them that using them can be an inconvenience. Sometimes he says he doesnapost want to do it.    He canapost see the long-term plan, that practicing now could mean that in the future he can walk and stand with his friends. But hopefully this is the start of a new le for him. And Tonyaposs experience may now help to change the law around sentencing for child cruelty. The maximum sentence that can be given for injuring a child is currently  years - thataposs the sentence his birth parents got. And the maximum sentence for killing a child is  years. We want to see those sentences increased and to be brought into line with adult GBH, manslaughter and murder so that a le sentence can be given for injuring or killing children.    Our MP, Tom Tugendhat has been fantastic and he is really pushing to get this bill through. Why should sentences be lower for injuring or killing a vulnerable child  It makes no sense. Tonyaposs Law could change that. Tom is meeting the Justice Minister to see where they can go with the bill now. It was emotional hearing Tom announce that it would be called Tonyaposs Law in the House of Commons. It was a total surprise.The Hudgell family are fundraising for Tony and to pay for disability equipment and treatment.

The heir to the throne, who turned  last November, took a break from his hectic schedule on the Caribbean island to cool off in crystal clear blue sea.  Former military man Charles is renowned for being very active, having served in both the navy and air force and trained as a jet pilot maintaining an incredible level of fitness.  He is also an avid polo player, goes on regular hikes, and has a regular fitness regimen.   The Prince has been known to do push-ups and crunches before bed and was even recorded asking the National Welsh Rugby team for training advice, to help him be even more fit.    Camilla, who is , also looked incredibly fit in an aqua-blue one-piece swimsuit with onlookers saying the royal couple “looked very happy together”.  The royal couple are undertaking more than  engagements, covering six countries and one overseas territory including a historic trip to Cuba over the next  days at the behest of the Foreign Office.  The highlight of their trip is a four-day tour of Cuba beginning on March  - the first by members of the monarchy.  One onlooker at the public beach in Barbados said: “Charles looked absolutely incredible. He has a physique of a very fit man less than half his age.    “He is testament to living a healthy and actively lestyle.” The images have drawn comparisons with infamous pictures of Charles from  when Jane Priest, a glamorous Perth model became a global sensation after famously ambushing him in the surf at Cottesloe Beach in front of the world’s media. Charles to the throne has previously joked how gym cross-trainers are the “instruments of torture”. He made the joke last November as he was given a tour of the new facilities at the police station in King’s Lynn, Norfolk. The heir maintains a strict diet, revealed in an interview for his th birthday, which revealed his eating habits are more like an eccentric retired Colonel’s than King Henry VIII’s.  It all starts with breakfast when Charles sits down to an egg boiled for exactly four minutes.  With that, he has a cup of Darjeeling tea with milk and honey.  The Prince always skips lunch but almost always has some form of game for his supper.  Indicating a borderline obsession with the small game birds, Charles has also claimed to have invented a version of moussaka using grouse - calling it “groussaka”.

Cristina Nicolotti, Sky News’ director of content, tweeted: “I’ve been incredibly impressed with the compassion, composure and determination shown by Jacinda Ardern in this dreadful crisis. “UK politicians take note.” Sharon Thompson, Labour councillor of North Edgbaston, said the New Zealand PM “has shown the world what true leadership can look like. “Empathy, understanding, action and unity - I applaud this woman for her compassion and not being afraid to lead NZ with real love.” And Islamic Theologian and Scholar Dr Yasir Qadhi spoke for many Muslims around the world when he wrote: “What a noble leader Jacinda Ardern is! A true role model for our times. I might not have known your name before… but you have forever won our respect, and the respect of millions around the globe.”    Within hours of the shooting on Friday morning, the Kiwi leader was already at work to bring her country together and reassure Muslims of their place in her society. “They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not,” she said in a moving statement. And she used the same language to speak to the killer, pointing out the New Zealand is made up of people of more than  ethnicities and  languages whose values would not be shaken by the murders. “You may have chosen us - we utterly reject and condemn you,” she said.  The next day she went to Christchurch, taking with her the leaders of all political parties, not just her own. Images of her on the verge of tears, consoling victims’ relatives and hugging the grieving, flew around the world. One photo, in particular, went viral - dressed in a hijab, her face a picture of grief as she listened during a meeting with Christchurch’s Muslim community. And she was seen hugging sobbing relatives tightly and holding their hands outside the city’s Kilbernie mosque, before laying flowers and paying her own tribute to victims at a makesht memorial.    But onlookers have also seen her uncompromising side, in particular in rebuttals she has made to Donald Trump. When asked during a press conference on Saturdayshe agreed with the US presidentaposs comment that he doesn’t see white nationalism as a rising threat, she answered simply: “No.” She also noted that Trump was among the international leaders who called to offer support, saying: “He very much wished for his condolences to be passed on to New Zealand. He asked what support the US could provide. My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” When she was asked how Trump responded, she said: “He acknowledged that and agreed.” And markedly unlike Trump, rather than simply offering thoughts and prayers she has vowed to ban semi-automatic weapons in the country, saying: “I can tell you one thing right now: Our gun laws will change.” While it took a tragedy for Ms Ardern to come to the attention of many around the world, she has long been seen as an impressive and compassionate leader in New Zealand. She became the youngest sitting MP in Parliament after being elected in  aged just .  The daughter of a veteran New Zealand police officer, she began her career working as a researcher in the office of the then-Prime Minister Helen Clark. She then volunteered in a soup kitchen in New York, before spending three years in the UK as a policy advisor of British PM Tony Blair . Her rise to become New Zealand’s th PM was so meteoric it was dubbed Jacindamania. In March  she was unanimously elected deputy leader of the Labour Party, before taking over as leader in August, then running in - and winning  - the country’s general election the following month. Aged just , she was the youngest Prime Minister in New Zealand for  years. And in office she continued to show that leadership could be dferent.  In her maiden speech, she referred to herself as a social democrat who believes strongly in the values of human rights, social justice, equality, and democracy, and the role of communities. Among many other issues, she is a big advocate of climate change, wants to reduce poverty and homelessness in the country, give young New Zealanders free tertiary education and decriminalise abortion. Known as a frugal leader, soon after she was elected she froze MPs salaries and insisted that her ministers use carpools to get to events. Last year she became only the second world leader in history to give birth while in office - the first was Pakistan’s late two-time PM Benazir Bhutto. By coincidence, at  she was the same age as Bhutto, and gave birth to baby Neve Te Aroha on exactly the same day, June , as the Pakistani leader did  years earlier. New Zealanders were so excited about the birth of her baby hundreds knitted boots and hats, and volunteered for babysitting service, as her due date grew closer.  In September Ms Ardern made history again by becoming the first female leader to attend the United Nations general assembly with her baby in tow. She even played with her three-month-old daughter before giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela peace summit, and while she spoke her partner and stay-at-home dad Clarke Gayford held the baby on his lap. Ms Arden insisted on paying for Clarke’s tickets to New York and other expenses out of her own pocket. Clarke posted a photo on Twitter on Monday of Neve’s security pass, which read “first baby”. He added: “I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change. Great yarn for her st .” Asked by the Today show on the US NBC networkit was harder to govern New Zealand or take her daughter on a -hour flight, Ardern responded with a laugh and said, “it felt at the time on par, adding that she had apologised to her fellow passengers in advance.  And she said she hoped she could help pave the way for other women to be able to work and raise children at the same time. She said: “If I can do one thing, and that is change the way we think about these things, then I will be pleased we have achieved something.” Ms Ardern has also impressed many with her commitment to a kind and more empathetic politics, shown by her refusal to capitalise on mistakes made by opposition leader Simon Brides. She has also been honest about mistakes and shows a willingness to be held to account, an attitude which has led some to criticise her for showing “weakness”. But Dr Claire Timperley, a political scientist at Victoria University believes they are misguided.  She said: “She is putting her neck out by saying ‘I want to claim kindness’ - kindnesses can also be interpreted as weaknesses. “I think she is being very intentional in trying to change the language around leadership, and saying actually you can be kind and you can also be strong.” Through the heartbreaking events of last week, Ms Ardern confounded her critics and showed the world that compassion and kindness can make for strong and bold leadership, something many around the world wish their own leaders would aspire to. The feeling was summed up by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which said in an editorial: “Ardern is a leader for our times, and we should follow her example.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside bunga bunga parties brought","story":"NewsInside Bunga Bunga parties that brought down a PM and now linked to models deathDozens of women who attend Silvio Berlusconi would throw debauched bashes which ended with the then Italy PM choosing which one to have sex withShareByMatt Roper:,  MAR NewsFormer escort Nadia Macri , implicated in alleged sexual scandals with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey were the lavish sex parties that became so infamous they even spawned a new word in the dictionary. Silvio Berlusconi coined the term ‘bunga bunga’ to describe the debauched soirees he would throw at his private villa, where young women performed raunchy dancers and strip for him. But when the parties, and allegations that some of the girls were underage, blew up in public the scandal led to the then Italian prime minister being jailed and banned from public office for le. The billionaire media mogul had his sentence quashed a year later on appeal. But bunga bunga could now come back to haunt Belusconi after authorities launched a murder investigation following the mysterious death of a model who was a regular guest at the parties and one of the main witnesses in his trial.    Moroccan Imane Fadil, , died on March  in a Milan hospital, a month after being admitted with stomach pains and telling staff she had been poisoned. Italy’s media have reported she may have been poisoned with a radioactive substances, while Milan’s chief prosecutor said there are “several anomalies” in her medical records. Ms Fadil, who told Berlusconi’s trial that young women wore nun’s costumes and stripped off while performing raunchy pole dances, was writing a book after her experiences at the bunga bunga parties with more potentially explosive revelations, according to reports. Until now Berlusconi, who served as Italian PM in four governments and, once owned football club AC Milan and who owns the country’s largest commercial broadcaster, may have thought he had escaped the sex scandal relatively unscathed. Commenting on Ms Fadil’s death, he continued to deny her claims that she attended his parties or that he paid women for sex. He said: “It’s always a pity when a young person dies. I never met this person, never talked to her. “What I read of her statements made me think that everything was invented, absurd.”    The secretive bunga bunga sessions first came to light in October , when Berlusconi personally phoned a police station asking for the release of a -year-old girl, Karima el-Mahroug, who had been accused of stealing a ,-euro bracelet. He wrongly told them that the girl was the niece of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. In fact the teenager was a Moroccan nightclub dancer and prostitute who called herself Ruby the Heart Stealer. Berlusconi, prosecutors later claimed, was terried police questioning her would find out that underage Ruby had been attending the ‘bunga bunga’ parties held at his palatial home, Villa San Martino, in Arcore, a small town outside of Milan. Following the phone call officers released her into the care of one of the prime minister’s associates, Nicole Minetti, a member of Berlusconi’s party who also pimped for the mogul and performed explicit lesbian floorshows in a nun’s costume. She took Ruby back to a flat she shared with a Brazilian prostitute, Michelle Conceicao, who was also later linked with Berlusconi after it was found she called him on his mobile phone while he was attending a summit in Paris.  But when prosecutors found out about PM’s intervention in her arrest, they began an investigation would culminate in one of the country’s most sensational trials. It was Ruby who first introduced the term ‘bunga bunga’, which she said was a lap-dancing competition in which the winner or winners got to sleep with Berlusconi. In an interview with prosecutor Antonio Sangermano soon after the police station incident, she claimed Berlusconi had sent a limo to her home to take her to the villa for the first time on Valentine’s Day . She said: “That evening Berlusconi explained to me that bunga bunga consisted of a harem that he copied from his friend Gaddafi , in which the girls take their clothes off and have to provide physical pleasures.” While Berlusconi never denied inviting women to his lavish parties, he always claimed they were “convivial” dinners with food, laughter and jokes, after which he would sometimes give them money because he was “generous” and wanted to help them.  But as more women came forward with lurid details of what would happen at the private bashes the case transfixed and shocked Italians. Prosecution documents listed the names of  young women, mostly would-be starlets hoping to break into showbusiness on one of Berlusconi’s television channels, who said were paid to have sex with him at the parties. They described how the parties always followed the same script, and ended with the prime minister choosing one of the girls to spent the night with. First, they said, came dinner, a meal often composed of foods in the red, white and green of Italy’s tricolor flag. Then followed what has become known as the ‘bunga bunga’ session, “which took place in a disco-like room where the female participants engaged in dressing up, striptease and erotic dances, touching each other or touching and being touched in their intimate parts by Silvio Berlusconi. Finally, at the end of the evening, -year-old Berlusconi would choose “one or more women with whom he spent the night in an intimate relationship, in exchange for money, expensive gts or rent-free apartments.  Some of the most eye-opening accounts of what happened at the mogul’s mansion came from Ambra Battilana and Chiara Danese, two women who had been wooed to a bunga bunga party with promises of jobs on Berlusconi’s TV channel. Ms Battilana said: Fteen minutes after we’d sat down, some of the girls uncovered their breasts, offering them to Berlusconi so he could kiss them. “They also touched the prime minister’s intimate parts and made him touch theirs. “While this was happening, the girls were still singing “thank goodness for Silvio!” and calling the prime minister “Papi” and Berlusconi called all of us “my little girls, my little girls. And Ms Danese claimed the PM asked women to kill the penis of a statue. She said: “After the umpteenth obscene joke, Berlusconi brings in a statue, it’s in a kind of case.From it emerges a little man with a huge penis. The statuette is the size of a half-litre bottle of water. Its penis is disproportionately big. “Berlusconi begins passing it around among the girls. And he asks them to kiss the penis. They kiss it and simulate oral sex with it, or they approach him with bared breasts. They all laugh. “At a certain point, the prime minister, visibly content, asks: “Are you ready for bunga bunga ” The girls shout together: “Yessss!!!” The police investigation also used wiretaps of women’s phones to get evidence of what happened during the secretive soirees. In the transcript of one call, party guest Maria Makdoum told how she did a belly dance in the ‘bunga bunga’ room while a pair of twin sisters, dressed in bra and panties, danced around “in a hard-core way” before Berlusconi and another male guest. “The other girls also danced, showing their breasts and their bottoms and they all went near the prime minister who touched them in their intimate parts,” she said.  In another leaked transcript Dario ‘Lele’ Mora - a TV impresario accused with others of procuring prostitutes for the premier - asked one woman: “Do you have a nurse’s outfit  Go get one today,” adding that she should wear nothing underneath except white suspenders for a “private health visit.” He was one of three Berlusconi aides accused of being part of a “vast pimping network” to attend bunga bunga parties with the prime minister. Police also tapped the calls of women to Berlusconi himself, some of which were leaked to Italian media. In a blow to Berlusconi’s self-cultivated ‘macho’ image, some of the women who allegedly slept with him for money complain that he is getting old, fat and flabby and should just ‘cough up’ or they will start stealing from his house. Others, speaking to him on the phone, call him ‘love’ before asking for more cash. Testying at the trial, Imane Fadil - the woman who died this month - said the parties involved young women, sometimes in pairs, wearing nuns’ costumes and stripping off while performing raunchy pole dances. She said: “They started to dance like the nuns of the film ‘Sister Act’ and then they took off their clothes.” At another party, a woman in her underwear stripped for Berlusconi wearing a mask with the face of footballer Ronaldinho, she said. Karima el-Mahroug, the girl known as Ruby whose arrest first sparked the investigation, also testied at the trial, claiming she first met Berlusconi when she was invited to a dinner party at his private village outside of Milan on Valentines Day  aged . She said the parties took place in a disco in Berlusconiaposs villa equipped with a lap dancing pole, where women danced and stripped down to their underwear. She said she also saw women dressed as then-US president Barack Obama or as a Milan magistrate who is leading the prosecution against Berlusconi in the sex scandal, wearing the red wig and black robes worn by magistrates in Italy. The girls who were dressed in costumes approached him in a sensual way as they danced. They raised their skirts, El-Mahroug testied, claiming the bunga bunga sessions soon turned into orgies among male and female guests.  But she denied sleeping with the frisky politician, claiming: “It’s the first time in my le that a man has not tried to take me to bed. He behaved like a father, I swear.” And she said he only gave her , euros after a party because she had told him she was in trouble. However in leaked wiretaps of her telephone conversations, however, she told friends that Berlusconi had offered to “cover her in gold” to keep quiet, and that she had demanded  million euros. Mobile phone records placed her at the Arcore villa  times between February and May .  In June  he was found guilty of paying for sex with an underage prostitute and of abusing his office, and was sentenced to seven years in prison and banned from holding public office for le. However, judges in Milan overturned the conviction on appeal last July, saying the facts of the case aposdid not constitute a crime.apos Berlusconi must have wished that would have been the end of talk of his infamous parties. But the untimely and suspicious death of one of the models at the centre of attempts to convict him could prove to be the biggest bunga bunga scandal of them all.  "},{"url":null,"title":"josef fritzls health declining monster","story":"NewsJosef Fritzls health declining and monster does not want to live anymoreTen years ago Fritzl was jailed for le after it emerged he and kept his own daughter as a sex slave for  years in a horror dungeonShareByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAR NewsJosef Fritzl is said to be suffering from dementia and lives his prison le in seclusion \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJosef Fritzlaposs health is declining rapidly in prison and he rarely leaves his cell for fear of attacks from fellow inmates, it has been reported.

CCTV footage showed Agnese Klavina, , appeared to be forced into Westley Capper’s Mercedes S before he drove off with pal Craig Porter, judges were told at the start of the Britsapos kidnap trial. Both have denied unlawful detention. Police investigating the mysterious disappearance said they categorised it as potentially “high-risk” from the start and arrested the Brits after discovering Miss Klavina was last seen leaving Aqwa Mist nightspot, in the upmarket resort of Puerto Banus, with them. Her phone stopped emitting a signal around five hours later, said police, who have been unable to locate her more than four years on.  Essex-born Capper, , and Porter,  could be sentenced to up to  years in prisonconvicted of unlawful detention. They took the witness stand at Malaga’s Audiencia Provincial court to deny “making Agnese disappear” or disposing of her body at sea. The Latvian-born waitress spent several years living in London before moving to the Costa del Sol around six months before she disappeared in the early hours of September , . A three-page state prosecution indictment submitted to the court ahead of the start of the trial on Monday claims the Brit pair asked Miss Klavina to accompany them to Capper’s home on the exclusive El Madronal residential estate a -minute drive from Aqwa Mist.  Prosecutor Maria del Carmen Tirado Galvez added in the indictment: “Westley George Capper took advantage of the fact she was under the effects of alcohol and and her intellectual and volitive faculties were affected and led her to his Mercedes S AMG car. “Agnese caused a fuss as she was led from the door of the nightclub to the car and showed she didn’t want to accompany the accused. “Despite this Westley George Capper put her into the vehicle which he was driving, while Craig Ian Porter who was in the passenger seat was waiting inside. “Agnese tried to get out of the car once she was inside but was prevented from doing so by the accused who then sped off towards El Madronal, both of them retaining Agnese Klavina against her will. “Since then there has been no news of her and the accused have not offered any information on her whereabouts.”  Capper, wearing a white shirt and black trousers in court, admitted drinking beer and vodka and taking drugs the night Miss Klavina vanished. But he insisted under oath she got into his car “willingly” after they met in the club and agreed to go back to his home to carry on partying despite failing to persuade a girlfriend she was with to accompany them. He refused to answer questions from lawyers acting for Miss Klavina’s family, but told the state prosecutor he was holding her by the waist as they left Aqwa Mist because she was “drunk and staggering. Private-school educated Capper said he dropped Miss Klavina off near a roundabout around three minutes drive from his home after she told him: “Stop here, I’ve changed my mind, I want to go home, this is where I live.” Prosecutor Maria del Carmen Tirado Galvez asked Capper during cross-examination: “Did you not think it’s strange that she wanted to be left at am in high heels more than two kilometres from her home ” Capper replied: “It was a well-lit area and I knew the turning near where I dropped her was full of houses. She said that’s where her house was and I didn’t know at the time she lived any further.”  He also insisted a number of  calls from his phone the morning Miss Klavina disappeared were made by accident and said he made repeated calls to a British friend called Paul Farmer who was questioned but never charged to try to buy drugs off him. Police records show he called his pal’s phone  times between .am and .am before ringing him repeatedly later the same morning. Asked about a suitcase and a carpet seen being taken onto Capper’s boat four days after Agnese’s disappearance when it was boarded by four men including the two defendants, he said: “I wasn’t carrying a carpet. I was carrying a case but it had clothes in it and bedding for the boat because I was planning to go to Ibiza for the closing parties.” Porter, the first of the two men to take the witness stand, insisted he fell asleep in the passenger seat on the ride home to Capper’s house and only discovered Miss Klavina was no longer with them when they reached his friendaposs home. Asked by his defence lawyer Inmaculada Garciahe intended to have sex with Miss Klavina, he answered No” and said the only reason he did not go straight home despite being “drunk and tired” was because he did not want to wake his we and children. He admitted to going out to sea on his pal’s boat Geofil II from Puerto de la Duquesa near Gibraltar on September , .  His defence lawyer asked him: “On that day did you or anyone you were with dispose of Agnese’s body ” Porter replied: “No.” Porter admitted to seeing missing posters shortly after Miss Klavina vanished but insisted he had never looked at them properly and could not remember what she had looked like. Aqwa Mist doorman Siani Ousmane, who is accused of being an accessory to the Brits’ alleged crime only by prosecutors for Miss Klavina’s family, told the court he had been asked to throw the pair out of the club by his boss because they were causing problems but insisted the missing woman never asked for his help. He described Miss Klavina as a regular at the nightclub. He insisted he only opened the Mercedes car door for Porter in the hope of a tip to supplement his meagre  euroa night wage - and said the missing blonde got in the vehicle herself and he did not push her in.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four. Six was a surprise.”The defeat, along with Hamilton Accies’ surprise win over Hearts on Saturday, means Dundee are now six points from safety down in the top flight drop zone.The postponement of St Mirren’s game at St Johnstone on Saturday because of snow means the Dark Blues remain a point above bottom."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face mammoth task against celtic but every point is vital says darren odea","story":"Every point is vital for Dundee now but experienced defender Darren O’Dea acknowledges they’ve got a “mammoth effort” ahead of them to get any from Celtic on Sunday.The league leaders and reigning champions head to Dens Park for a lunchtime kick-off on Sunday time as clear favourites to pick up the three points on offer.That would take them one step closer to an eighth-straight title but Irish international O’Dea has no interest in that despite his history with the Parkhead club – his only worry is getting points on the board for the Dark Blues.With the business end of the season on the horizon, the -year-old knows it’s vital Dundee get a leg up on their relegation rivals Hamilton and St Mirren.Despite the Dens men being as much as   with some bookies to pick up a victory, O’Dea has been part of Dundee sides that have picked up results against the Hoops – three goalless draws since his arrival in January .He told the Tele: “Every game is vital but Sunday doesn’t get much harder.“There have been games recently where we could’ve got more out of.“Since I’ve been here we’ve picked up some results against them both home and away but, one thing is for sure, it takes a mammoth effort.“It needs every player to be near the top of their game and we aim to do that this weekend.“It will be dficult and take a huge amount of effort but I don’t think effort is something we’ll have to worry about –we can get that wee bit of quality we’ve lacked at certain times, hopefully, we can pick up a result.”Dundee go into Sunday’s contest on the back of a poor run of form, losing their last three league matches against Hibs, Rangers and then Hearts.It’s not all doom and gloom for O’Dea, however, after an improved display in the - loss to the Jambos at Dens Park last Saturday.With chances spurned and a poor goal conceded, the Edinburgh side left with the points but the centre-half says Dundee can take a lot from their performance into Sunday, evenCeltic’s fluid frontline brings a dferent threat to the direct and physical approach from Craig Levein’s men last week.“Hearts aren’t embarrassed at the way they play and they shouldn’t be, they won the game, but Celtic will be a completely dferent style of play,” O’Dea said.“There are dferent ways to play against that, none of them easy, but the manager will figure out which way we go about it and we know we’re at the stage where every point is vital.”He added: “The Hearts game was scrappy, their style made it that way which is fine but they were very direct but they didn’t create too much.“The goal was an absolute stramash with bodies all over the place and they had Morrison with a shot just after but, bar that, I can’t think of any more shots they had on goal.“We were structured well as a team but we looked dangerous and for it being a really scrappy game we were the ones who created the moments of quality in the game.“For a final ball or a finish, % it wouldn’t have been undeserved to get a point or maybe more but we didn’t.“Now that’s neither here nor there, Hearts have three points and we don’t, but we can take positives from the performance.“We are in the business end of the season so it’s only results that matter but, in terms of endeavour and chances created, there are positives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee pride 2019 to be bigger than last year say organisers","story":"The time and location of Dundee Pride  has been announced — and it looks certain to be a bigger affair than last year’s inaugural march.Slessor Gardens will become a sea of rainbow colours when it hosts the festival on Saturday September .Dundee Pride co-chairmen Tim Kelly and Tommy Small made the announcement at Klozet Bar, as well as outlining the timeline for the march’s organisation.No acts have been confirmed yet but anyone who wants to get involved can make their interest known between April  and June .The same dates apply for prospective stall holders.

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee uniteds game at dunfermline called off","story":"Dundee United#s game at Dunfermline has been called off.The referee has deemed the East End Park pitch unplayable due to being waterlogged.The Fe club had released a statement at am saying there were no plans to hold a pitch inspection because the pitch was considered playable.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united win can put pressure on top dogs ross county","story":"Theof winter weather last weekend, and the raft of postponements it led to, has given Dundee United the chance to put some pressure on leaders Ross County when the Championship’s top two clash at Tannadice tonight.First to fall foul of the conditions was County’s Highland derby trip to Inverness Caley Thistle on Friday evening, that one going off because of a waterlogged pitch.Had it gone ahead, it would have provided the Staggies with the opportunity to stretch their advantage over United in the race for automatic promotion to a massive  points.Their own scheduled action at Dunfermline on Saturday afternoon had to be called off after heavy snow and rain left the East End Park playing surface saturated.United had already arrived at the ground and most of their travelling support were not that far away when the call-off was confirmed just  minutes from kick-off.That made it a frustrating afternoon, particularly as it was clear the pitch was in no fit state for a game to be played.But it still means the Tangerines can cut the deficit to their main rivals to eight pointsthey can beat them.With another clash between the pair to come in the Highlands early next month, a victory would leave boss Robbie Neilson still believing his side can finish in top spot in the second tier.To do that United will have to find the form that’s deserted them in recent outings. They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

The cash injection could double the  aerospace jobs in Ayrshire to . The money has been announced as part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal, which was agreed last Friday. Plans for two new aircraft hangars have been revealed. There will be a purpose-built ,ft² aerospace and space innovation centre for research and business development in partnership with universities. A visitor centre promoting science around space and aviation is also included in the bid. And up to to ,ft² of industrial manufacturing space is to be developed. Publicly-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport has made a loss in the past. A transport assessment is taking place to weigh up the impact of expansion on rail and road links. The airport vision was revealed on Friday when the Ayrshire Growth Deal heads of terms agreement was signed by politicians. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “From a UK perspective Prestwick is one of the most important sites for aerospace and a potential spaceport.” Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the plans would see the public and private sector join forces with academia to grow the aerospace and space sector. The deal sees £ million invested by the UK Government, £ million by the Scottish Government and £ million from South Ayrshire Council in the airport. South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said the deal overall ensured Ayrshire “punches well above its weight in terms of what we contribute to the economy”. He described the signing of the heads of agreement as a “truly historic occasion” and the “pinnacle of more than three years of hard work.” Councillor Brian McGinley, local economy and culture chief, said: “To make the most of this investment we are determined that the benefits are shared by all, bringing quality training and jobs that will pay good wages.” Overall the £. million Ayrshire Growth Deal aims to generate  jobs. The investment will be delivered over  years. Elsewhere in the area there are plans for a low-carbon energy scheme at Hunterston, a local electricity supply project in Cumnock and a manufacturing corridor in Kilmarnock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilUniversities and CollegesCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Patna Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands biggest school takes shape","story":"NewsScotlands biggest school takes shape in Ayrshire£m super school will open in the summer of ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was a real family affair for a Cumnock boy after he bumped into his dad during a VIP trip to what will be Scotland’s biggest school.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks. The application at Tweedbridge Court was refused."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-peer-lord-steel-suspended-from-lib-dems-after-giving-evidence-about-cyril-smith","story":"BORDERS peer Lord Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats, pending an investigation into evidence he gave to an inquiry about child abuse allegations against former MP Sir Cyril Smith.The move, announced by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, comes after Lord Steel, a former Scottish Parliament presiding officer, gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseon Wednesday.The party had already announced they have started disciplinary proceedings against him, after he told the probe a conversation with Smith left him \"assuming\" the allegations were correct, but the party did not investigate them.The decision followed a meeting of senior figures within the Scottish party on Thursday evening.In a subsequent statement, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: \"Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on th March , the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed.\"The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation.

Obviously I disapproved but as far as I was concerned it was past history.\"In a statement released before he was suspended on Thursday, Lord Steel said he wanted to \"clary what happened in  when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye\".He added: \"As I told the inquiry yesterday, I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it.\"He admitted to me that the report was correct, in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him.\"I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council , but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me, as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time.\"I was in no position to re-open the investigation.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the decision to suspend Lord Steel was taken by the party in Scotland \"quickly, properly and in an orderly way\".He told BBCs Newsnight: \"There was very serious concern about what he said, serious allegations, they have got to be investigated.\"Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, who is acting on behalf of some victims at the inquiry, said: \"My clients will welcome the news that Steel is finally being made to face the consequences of his inaction.\"His failure to stop Smith in , allowing him to go on and abuse more young boys, is inexcusable and he must be held to account.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mountain-bike-trail-plans-unveiled-for-galashiels","story":"THE blueprints for a series of community bike, pedestrian and horse riding trails have been published, sparking concerns from local residents.Plans for a network of trails on Blaikiersquos Hill, above the Langlee area of Galashiels, were first proposed in  by then Gala councillor Bill White.But it has taken until now for detailed plans to be drawn up.The proposed network will connect Ladhope golf course in the northwest, to Langlee in the southeast, and Langlee Mains on the northeast face of Blaikiersquos Hill.The land on which Ladhope golf course sits is owned by the Galashiels common good fund, as is the land containing Langlee woods, while the rest of the hill is privately owned.Trail designer Peter Laing appeared at a meeting of the Galashiels common good fund sub committee this week to unveil the proposed network.He told councillors: ldquoWersquove spoke to all of the landowners and theyrsquore all quite positive about the use of the land for recreation and the upgrading of paths through their ground.ldquoWersquore going through the consultation process which is contacting interested parties and getting their opinions on the scheme.ldquoThere is already existing rights of way, maintained by the council, from Ladhope to Langlee, and one that travels north up to Stow.ldquoThe section on the north west face of the hill will be for families and recreation. There will be easy climbing, and therersquos two possible loops one at Ladhope and one at Langlee, so there is good potential at both ends for family route.ldquoThe other type of route we call lsquofit familyrsquo. Higher grade cycling, running, and walking, on higher ground.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, itrsquos a big area, the views are fantastic, and people will want to get up there.

The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this.

Some were not told full details until this year, when the case reached the professional watchdog.The council claims it did all it could to keep families informed, but the problems were largely down to one rogue teacher, and the schoolrsquos former deputy head who failed to pass concerns on was disciplined and has subsequently left the profession. Further delays were caused by the school holidays and allowing the police investigation to run its course.But between March and June  when police were finally called in, pupil Arsquos unsuspecting parents had agreed to him having daily one-to-one lessons with Mrs Mackie. The boyrsquos mother says she and her husband went in three times to speak to the school over this period to discuss their sonrsquos sudden aversion to school and changes in his behaviour - and were still not told colleagues had raised concerns overMrs Mackies treatment of their son.Meanwhile the mother of pupil lsquoPrsquo in the GTC case ndash whose son Mackie left to bang his head off the floor until he was hysterical and covered in bruises says the publication of the hearing findings last week was the first time she knew in full what had happened to her son.She says it took this family a year and a half to get to the stage where P was able to go to school willingly again.Both families say the emphasis appears to have been on the teacherrsquos wellbeing throughout, rather than that of pupils ndash in breach of ldquoGetting it Right for Every Childpolicies, which state that childrenrsquos needs should always be paramount.Meanwhile the Herald has learned that another child at Chatelherault had fruit forced into his mouth by a dferent teacher. Investigations were launched into this case, but were dropped after the woman left teaching.An education insider at South Lanarkshire Council, has claimed Mrs Mackiersquos mistreatment of pupils would have been reported earlier, but other staff were ldquoafraid of her reactionthey intervened.The claims come as autism and learning disability charities warn that behavioural problems in pupils who are non verbal or on the autistic spectrum are often leading to children being restrained, isolated or mistreated. In fact, parents and charities say such misbehaviour is often an attempt to communicate rather than to be lsquobadrsquo.South Lanarkshire council officials believe the mistreatment was a one off and is not evidence of a pattern within the councilrsquos schools.The council says it runs four tailored programmes for autistic children of dferent ages, delivered in partnership with the National Autistic Society.It has a dedicated resource in Hamilton for people with autism and their families, and has given , primary and secondary teachers training in meeting the needs of autistic pupils.A council spokesman said: ldquoPupil safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance in South Lanarkshirersquos schools.ldquoWe always act swtly and appropriately when any allegations of inappropriate activity are brought to our attention, and that is exactly what happened in this case.Once the concerns were brought to the attention f the headteacher in June , a formal investigation was launched immediately and disciplinary action was instigated, while the matter was reported to both the police and the General Teaching Council.ldquoAt every stage we were as open with parents as possible, given the restrictions imposed on us by the police investigation and subsequent court case, ldquo the spokesman said.ldquoThe school continued to meet parents regularly to work together to help their children, and as part of this we have apologised for any incidents where the high standards that we set, and which parents rightly expect, were not delivered by iniduals.He added: ldquoWe are pleased that all of the pupils referred to in the GTCS hearing, and those whose cases have been raised by the Herald, remain in our schools, with parents and staff working together to give them the best possible educational experience."},{"url":null,"title":"bumper-shetland-oil-fields-could-be-in-production-for-decades","story":"The company has launched a drilling programme that will target two big prospects that could help unlock the potential of a frontier area that sector watchers reckon could help ensure a bright future for the industry.Success for Siccar Point in the programme would encourage other firms to step up the hunt for finds off Shetland.

For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The leboat’s entire crew of eight lost their lives as they selflessly headed towards the cargo ship.The crew lost were: coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, nd coxswain James Johnston, bowman Ray Kirkpatrick, mechanic Robert Johnston, assistant mechanic James Swanson, and crew Jack Kirkpatrick, Robert Johnston and Eric McFadyen.Longhope RNLI and Longhope Leboat Museum Trust have in recent months, been in the process of preparing for the commemorative events marking  years since the loss of the T.G.B. and her gallant crew.Those events will take place both on land and at sea today, including at the Longhope Leboat Museum, the former leboat shed in Brims, where Longhope leboats were based for many years, before being based at Longhope Pier.Commemorations will also take place in front of the Longhope Leboat Memorial at Osmundwall, and at the YM Hall, Longhope.It is planned that a flotilla of boats, including RNLI leboats from Thurso, Stromness, Wick, and the current Longhope Leboat, plus the Coastguard tug Ievoli Black, an Orkney Harbours tug, pilot boat, and vintage leboat from Ireland, will congregate in Aith Hope, to lower their flags as a mark of respect. The Coastguard will also be represented by one of their rescue helicopters.Flags at leboat stations around Scotland, the RNLI’s Divisional Base in Perth, and at the RNLI’s HQ in Poole will be lowered to half mast.Coverage will appear online on The Orcadian Facebook page today, and in a special supplement in The Orcadian, out on Thursday.Local company Cloudnet IT Solutions also plan to livestream aspects of the events live at: https:livestream accounts  TGBLonghope vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Most who hold this ancient office know the importance of not being seen to interfere directly in the politics of the issues of the day and so usually don’t trouble the headline writers.John Bercow, however, has demonstrated on a number of occasions that he is not afraid to do just that. And yesterday he made a ruling that has thrown Theresa May’s attempts to pass her Brexit deal with the EU into disarray.Amid signs that hardline Brexiteers were beginning to crumble, belatedly accepting the reality that their fancul demands were never going to be met and that May’s deal was the only realistic one on offer, the UK Government had started to believe they might have a chance of finally getting it through the Commons. But then, with  days to go before the UK leaves the EU without any kind of deal, Bercow announced that the Government could not legitimately “resubmit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week which was rejected by  votes”.: Brexit: John Bercow rules out third vote on deal without changesParliamentary convention dating back to , he argued, prevented this on the grounds that allowing repeated votes on the same issue would enable governments to misuse MPs’ time and ignore their decisions.However, critics of his decision pointed to a considerably more recent opinion – from Bercow himself – that suggested he might be playing politics. “If we were guided only by precedent, manestly nothing in our procedures would ever change,” he told MPs in January.And it should go without saying that these are “unprecedented” times where the most important thing is the national interest – not parliamentary traditions. Only in similarly high-stakes situations would any future Government be able to cite this as a precedent.Bercow, who has revealed he had voted Remain, may believe he is defending the Commons’ rules others will suspect he hopes defeating May’s deal will lead to a second referendum. If the latter is true, he is playing a dangerous game of roulette that could well result in the worst of all outcomes – a no-deal Brexit. A delay and a second referendum would indeed be the best way out of our current mess, but MPs need to come to this conclusion themselves, not be bounced into it by the Speaker.: Nicola Sturgeon accuses Theresa May of undermining Holyrood over DUP Brexit deal©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"letters no shortage of traitor knaves as brexiteers ignore burns philosophy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nobody seems to have noticed how the whole philosophy of Brexit runs completely contrary to that of our most famous poet, who in one of his masterpieces wrote: #For a# that, and a# that, It#s comin# yet for a# that, That man to man, the world o#er, Shall brothers be for a# that!#Sadly, this concept seems to run at loggerheads with the desires of ‘little England’ MPs.Not one Tory MP, from north or south of the Border, has expressed a grain of sympathy for the vast majority of Scots, who voted to remain in the EU six times in proportion to the margin by which the rUK­voted to leave. Yet the latter vote is held to be sacrosanct.: Jim Sillars urges SNP to back May’s Brexit dealThis is particularly disappointing, but unsurprising, with regard to the Scottish Tories and I hope they will be held to account by the Scottish electorate, in due time.The problem for many of our friends living south of the Border is, and has been for centuries, that when they go abroad, they see the indigenous ­residents as the foreigners, and not themselves. Indeed, they have coined many ­disparaging epithets to apply to our continental neighbours. I will limit myself to one: Johnny Foreigner. : Brexit: John Bercow throws May’s deal into disarrayMichel Barnier told the UK two and a half years ago that we could not expect as good a deal out as we had in, and that THE problem would be Ireland. To his credit, this has remained their position throughout, but incredibly, it is still falling on deaf ears.Scotland, I fear, is plummeting earthward, in an aircraft for which the vast majority of us did not buy a boarding pass.

There is a places of worship security funding scheme in England and Wales. No such scheme exists in Scotland. Will the minister urgently consider this and commit the government and agencies to work with all our faith communities to deliver it \"Mr Sarwars question came as MSPs from all parties expressed their solidarity with the people of Christchurch as well as their condolences to the families and communities affected by the massacre.Aileen Campbell, said at a visit last week to Glasgow Central Mosque by Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Minister Humza Yousaf in the wake of the Christchurch massacre, they \"committed to explore further what the Scottish Government could do to provide reassurances for all faith communities and their places of worship including exploring issues around safety and security, including touching on the funding that Anas Sarwar mentioned. So we are working through that and will continue to keep Parliament involved.\"Mr Sarwar also raised the topic of social media, and said it was being used by people with extreme views to amply them, \"recruit, organise and fundraise\".He added: \"This tragic attack didnt surprise me and it probably didnt surprise Muslims across the UK or around the world. The \"us versus them\" rhetoric the sowing the seeds of hate and the othering of our fellow citizens has become all too common.\"What action will the Scottish Government take to engage with social media s and make them understand their responsibilities to help create a fairer, more equal world \"Ms Campbell said she chaired an action group which aims to establish more cohesive communities and tackle prejudice and that it could look at what could be done to curtail the \"toxic messages\" spread on social media.She added: \"Being elected we are in a privileged position to be listened to and influence more generally. We can show leadership to build a more tolerant and respectful community and to reach out to those who feel threatened and vulnerable or we could choose to use that position to stoke up hate - and weve seen too much of that and we cannot remain immune from the consequences of that toxicity of language which many choose to use and which bring consequences like we have seen in New Zealand.\"We should call out hate and show solidarity with our Muslim friends and communities who need our support at this time and know that we love and cherish what they contribute to our erse Scotland.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon asked to apologise for disgraceful comment","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has been asked to apologise to a serving police officer after she branded his comments about public sector pay rises as #disgraceful#.Her remarks came in response to a letter read out by Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson at today’s First Minister’s Questions.The letter from an East Kilbride policeman questioned why officers received a smaller pay rise than teachers or NHS staff.He askedpolice were regarded as an “easy target” because they are barred from taking industrial action and questioned the value the Scottish Government placed on the police service.This year’s pay offer for police was . per cent compared with . per cent for teachers and nine per cent for NHS workers.But the First Minister hit back at the suggestion, and said: “Parts of those comments were quite disgraceful actually.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Sir James said climate change means people should cut their water use by a third, half of all leaking pipes must be repaired, and huge new reservoirs, treatment plants and transport pipes builtEngland is to continue quenching its thirst. “Around  years from now, where those [where demand overtakes supply] lines cross is known by some as the ‘jaws of death’ – the point at which we will not have enough water to supply our needs, unless we take action to change things,” Sir Bevan told the . : Quality of drinking water in Scotland ‘among best in the world’Sir Bevan spoke to the newspaper before a speech at Tuesday’s Waterwise conference in London. He said attitudes to water wastage need to alter, and added that supply companies must understand that climate change is their “biggest operating risk”. Michael Roberts, CEO of strategists Water UK, agrees. : £bn plan to share Scots water with EnglandSpeaking to the iNews, he said: “A twin-track approach is the right way to go, reducing demand for water at the same time as increasing supply to deal with the challenges of growth on the one hand and climate change on the other.” Mr Roberts said water companies have committed to cut leakage by  per cent by  – which could be too late. While the Environment Agency has proposed building new reservoirs and distribution chains in England in order to maintain an adequate supply, others think there are alternative solutions, and bolder plans are required.Peter Murphy, director of consultancy firm UK Water , said Scotland is the answer to England’s problems. He told iNews: “Loch Ness has more water than all of England and Wales combined. And that’s just one loch – Scotland has more than , freshwater lochs, and most are unused. “Scotland has a small population and has about  times more water than it uses. The country’s hydrological cycle is only going to improve – climate change means Scotland is going to get warmer, and therefore wetter.“Scotland’s population will probably increase too, but we should all be thinking about investment and opportunity. Scotland lends itself to water collection – rerouting water to England would cost less than HS. There’s a lot of short-sightedness. “Birmingham would go dry in a dayit wasn’t for Wales. It’s the United Kingdom after all”. Climate change fears Mr Murphy was talking about the Elan Valley Reservoirs, a chain of purpose-built lakes, damns and rivers in mid-Wales, which supply England’s second city. The system was built in the s and finished in  at a cost of £ million. In , the BBC reported Severn Trent Water had begun the £m Birmingham Resilience Project, which will see water from the River Severn at Lickhill pumped into the city. The scheme, set to be completed in , means an emergency supply will be available when the Elan Valley Aqueduct is drained for repairs. Such work shows just how fragile England’s water supply is. By , Britain is forecasted to be regularly enduring summers hotter than the  heatwave, which Sir Bevan said will leave the country with - per cent less water in some rivers.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters.

Also little ones can get creative and make a sheep brooch, a rainbow mobile or a snake to take home on the day as well as having their face painted.You might even get the opportunity to get a selfie with St Patrick himself.As well as the “flesh and blood” version the entertainment hub will be host to a beautul hand carved wooden statue of the one-time Slemish shepherd.It was carved by Miguel Frederico Neves and stands over ft tall.There will be no parking at Slemish, Carnstroan Road or Carnstroan Lane, so a free park and ride service will operate from the former Michelin plant, Broughshane, just off the M.The shuttle bus to Slemish Mountain will run continually from am – :pm stopping in Broughshane village so nobody will miss out on the free entertainment and shopping offers.The one and a half kilometre walk at Slemish takes approximately one hour up and down and it is strongly advised that suitable clothing and strong footwear is worn.Sections of the short climb can be steep and slippery and might not be suitable for all.For those who would enjoy an easier trek than Slemish, a gentle riverside walk from Raceview Mill takes visitors past the Raceview hedgehog habitat and along the beautul river Braid as it meanders around the village. Come rain or shine, Broughshane and District Community Association will be providing the hub of entertainment on Saturday  March with fun for all the family to enjoy.

The phone hasnt stopped.

The scheme has provided an opportunity for The Carson Project, Dunclug Youth Forum and Doury Road Development Group to explore the potential of working together to help embed good relations and peace building at a local level and to build upon work done to date.One member of the audience, better qualied than most in terms of judging audience response at The Braid is Council Arts Officer Rosalind Lowry and she admitted she was blown away by the performance and the audience reaction.What a fantastic atmosphere, she said. The BRAID project organisers deserve huge congratulations for the concert - it was fabulous.And the appreciation was not a one-way street with Garda band leader Pat Kenny saying: Im delighted everyone enjoyed the concert.The warmth that came from the audience was something I will cherish for a very long time. Please give my regards to all and God willing we will all meet again.Sandy Wilson of North Antrim Community Network echoed the thoughts of many who attended when he made special mention of Ballymenas Colum Best, a major driving force behind the evening.He said: Congratulations - mainly to youfor your vision about hosting the concert and to the other community people involved.It was a truly enjoyable and memorable evening for everyone and i think two standing ovations at the end said it all. We really enjoyed the singers as well , they really added to the talent and iety of the musical performance. Well done to all ! Colum admitted he was almost overwhelmed by the response. He told the : It was out of this world and people leaving at end of night were saying that it was the best concert they had ever been at. “I have never seen an audience cheer as loud or stand up to applaud so much .. the place was really rocking.

Since then emergency repairs have been undertaken as the building had been unoccupied for a number of years following the deaths of Jim and Sally Gillen, Gracehill’s last postmasters. Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

He gave us some documentation and advice about places to go that were connected with my ancestors. One of these places was a church in Tullylish.“At Tullylish Church of Ireland, we were walking towards the church when a woman hurried after us, grabbed Doug by the arm and said ‘Hello, you must join us for lunch,’” said Mary. “It turned out that we’d arrived on the day of their fortnightly free lunch. “Jim, one of the volunteers, took us to the church and unlocked the vestry so we could take photographs and then we had lunch in the hall.”Mary also spent time with a woman she met at the new Gilford Castle, as one of Mary ancestor’s hailed from old Gilford Castle. “We knocked on the door hoping there was someone there and met Christine, who invited us in and we compared my family tree with a version she had in a book.”Police appeal for safe St Patrick’s Day Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Mary also had a phone call from Martin Crozier who gave her additional information.

However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37925662.ece/b9249/AUTOCROP/w620h342/BT_06385.jpg","title":"cookstown hotel crush horror people were scratching biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath says witness","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We didn’t want to give in,” said general manager Sandi Harding, who has worked at the franchise for  years and receives a lot of the credit for keeping it alive well past its expiration date.“We did everything we could to cut costs and keep ourselves relevant.”The store was once one of five Blockbusters owned by the same couple, Ken and Debbie Tisher, in three central Oregon towns.But by last year, the Bend franchise was the last local Blockbuster standing.A Blockbuster Video in Bend, Oregon is the last one on the planet after the only other Blockbuster in Australia announced it’s closing on March .The store is now booming with business from long-time locals as well as tourists. A tight budget meant no money to update the surviving store.That’s paying off now with a nostalgia factor that stops first-time visitors of a certain age in their tracks: the popcorn ceilings, low fluorescent lighting, wire metal video racks and the ubiquitous yellow-and-blue ticket stub logo that was a cultural touchstone for a generation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sandi Harding has worked at the franchise for  years “Most people, I think, when they think about renting videos,they’re the right age, they don’t remember the movie that they went to pick, but they remember who they went with and that freedom of walking the aisles,” said Zeke Kamm, a local resident who is making a documentary about the store called The Last Blockbuster with a friend.“In a lot of towns, the Blockbuster was the only place that was open past nine o’clock, and a lot of them stayed open until midnight, so kids who weren’t hoodlums would come here and look at movies and fall in love with movies.”The Bend store had eight years under its belt as a local video store before it converted to a Blockbuster in , a time when this high desert city was still a sleepy community with a small-town feel to match.Customers kept coming back, drawn by special touches like staff recommendations, a “wish list” for videos to add to the rental selection and even home delivery for a few special customers who couldn’t drive in.Dozens of local teens have worked there over the years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store makes a good income from merchandise Then, in , Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by , all corporate-owned stores had shuttered.That left locally owned franchises to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed.When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down last summer, barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store, Bend’s Blockbuster was the only US location left.Tourists started stopping by to snap selfies, and business picked up.Harding ordered up blue-and-yellow sweat shirts, T-shirts, cups, magnets, bumper stickers, hats and stocking caps from local vendors emblazoned with the words The Last Blockbuster In America, and they flew off the shelves.Then, this month, she got a phone call: The world’s only other Blockbuster, in Perth, Australia, would soon close its doors.A new T-shirt order went out, this time with the slogan The Last Blockbuster On The Planet, and the store is already getting a new wave of selfie-snapping visitors from as far away as Europe and Asia.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store has become something of a tourist attraction On a recent weekday, Michael Trovato of Melbourne, Australia, stopped by while visiting his twin sister in Bend.After posing for a photo, Trovato said he misses a time when choosing a movie meant browsing hundreds of titles and asking a video clerk for insight instead of letting a movie-streaming service recommend one for him based on a computer algorithm.“I miss quite a bit being able to walk into a Blockbuster or CD store and have that social experience and see people looking at stuff and talking to people,” Trovato said. “It’s something you don’t get from the slick presentation of a music service or, you know, from the internet.”The Bend store doesn’t seem to be in danger of closing anytime soon.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Some parents find things in the store they can’t find online Its newfound fame has been a shot in the arm, and customers stream in to buy  US dollar sweat shirts,  dollar T-shirts and even  dollar yellow-and-blue beanies hand-knit by Harding herself.The store pays Dish Network for the right to use the Blockbuster logo and has several years left on its lease.People regularly send the store boxes of old VHS tapes and DVDs.

Posting pictures of iconic Sesame Street characters to Twitter, the TV show asked: “You’re stuck on a deserted island and you can pick one of these Sesame Street friends to come with you. Who are you picking and why ”The show gave social media users a choice between The Cookie Monster, Elmo, Grover, and Oscar the Grouch.You’re stuck on a deserted island and you can pick one of these Sesame Street friends to come with you. Who are you picking and why  🤔 pic bGjFBxXo— Sesame StreetMarch , The question caused a fair few arguments on the site, with celebrities including Joseph Gordon-Levitt weighing in with their opinions on the furry characters. Here are the best arguments… Which character would you pick . At first look, Elmo was the obvious choice for many. Elmo is the ONLY choice. Grover: too anxiousCookie Monster: would go through cookie withdrawal  who even knows what his sober personality isOscar: anyone who chooses Oscar should be on a watchlist https:t.co dmKLvZszKg— Paul F. TompkinsMarch , . But for this person, Grover’s work ethic gave him the edge. I had a hard time choosing between Elmo and Grover....but Id have to go with Grover.The guy has a lot of jobs over the past  years so he has a lot of expertise on how to survive on a deserted island.— Baby LambMarch ,  . Cookie Monster would only be useful on Cookie Island. Cookie Monster cause he could hunt for Coookkkies!!! pic BSmLvQVzE— diane #ForAll straubMarch , . Some were very sure of their convictions. Oscar can and will murder me in my sleep.   chance Cookie monster will get hungry, hallucinate that I am a giant cookie and eat me. Elmo is a literal  year old and Grover is a superhero who can fly. Who dyou think Im going with  https:t.co tOCefteo— Patrick SmithMarch ,  . This quite logical answer. Elmo. His absence would hurt the shows bottom line the most and therefore the bigwigs would send out the largest search party for him . https:t.co jOPRMBBpWY— Ken DavidoffMarch , . Joseph Gordon-Levitt wanted to think outside of the box. Breaking the rules. Picking ANIMAL. https:t.co CNPxSbSeL— Joseph Gordon-LevittMarch ,  . Oscar would be the best for finding food… Id choose Oscar because he seems like a good forager. Elmo would just annoy me, Cookie Monster would eat everything and Grover doesnt seem like he works well under pressure. https:t.co GNfWSB— Dartunorro D. ClarkMarch , .

It borders Russia to the north and China to the east and has extensive oil reserves that make it strategically and economically important.   Mr Nazarbayev came to power in  as its Communist Party chief when it was part of the Soviet Union, and was first elected president weeks before the  Soviet collapse.In those days, Kazakhstan was a backwater region best known for prisons, nuclear testing sites and being the home of the launch facility of the Soviet space programme, the Baikonur Cosmodrome.Mr Nazarbayev has been widely praised for maintaining stability and ethnic peace in Kazakhstan but has also faced criticism for marginalising the political opposition and creating what is effectively a one-party state.He has maintained a delicate balance between Russia and the West, leading Kazakhstan to join a Russia-dominated economic alliance of ex-Soviet nations, but cultivating close energy ties and other links with the West.He was lauded abroad for modernising the oil industry and his decision to give up the nuclear weapons Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union.In , he moved the country’s capital from Almaty to the remote northern city of Astana in what was widely considered a way to fuse the ethnic-Russian minority in the north to the new Kazakh state. The new city was filled with post-modern architecture including the soaring glass pyramid of the Palace of Peace and Accord, dedicated to harmony among religious and ethnic groups.In , Mr Nazarbayev was awarded the title of Leader of the Nation, which comes with lelong immunity from prosecution and as-yet untested powers of veto over some government policies.He departs at a time of rare open protest against the government.He fired his prime minister and cabinet last month following a wave of protests by Kazakh women calling for more financial support for children and safer housing after a fire in which five children died. Soon after, he announced a programme of more generous spending for large families.He has extended his tenure by landslide victories in successive elections and plebiscites. He took nearly % of the vote in the most recent election, in , when he was elected for another five-year term.His resignation will set the stage for a potential battle between Russia and the US for influence with the successor government.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nursultan Nazarbayev with Vladimir Putin in  Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had spoken with Mr Nazarbayev by telephone earlier on Tuesday but did not say what they discussed.Nazarbayev was born into a poor rural labourer’s family on July  . As a young adult, he worked in harsh conditions at a steel plant’s blast furnace and at  he joined the Communist Party. He worked his way up in the party, went to university and became known for his comparatively candid assessments of the Soviet Union’s shortcomings.That turn of mind positioned him in the reformist camp that came to ascendancy when Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in .Mr Nazarbayev was the last of Central Asia’s former Communist Party bosses to remain in power after the deaths of Turkmenistan’s Saparmurat Niyazov in  and Uzbekistan’s Islam Karimov in . The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, is now the region’s longest-serving head of state, having assumed power in  during a civil war."},{"url":null,"title":"call make ae services accessible children autism spectrum","story":"Independent Nationalist candidate for the Moor, Emmet Doyle has called on the Western Trust to explore ways of making Accident and Emergency services more accessible to those service users who may have young children with sensory dficulties or who are on the autism spectrum.He said: \"Our healthcare staff do a fantastic job and provide a first class service to patients.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

But the Department ruled out the installation of a yellow parking line around Cedar Court.He said: ldquoAs the entrance into Cedar Court is a private entrance and does not form part of the adopted road network, the Department is unable to introduce corner waiting restrictions at this location.ldquoIt is, however, an offence to park across a private entrance, or on a footway, in such a manner to cause an obstruction, whether waiting restrictions are in place or not.ldquoIn the past officials have spoken with Down High School to highlight the issue, the last time being in October, . This previously had a positive effect and as such the Department will again speak to the school to ask pupils not to obstruct entrances and footways in a manner that causes inconvenience or danger to local residents.ldquoHowever,this parking behaviour does continue, then it should be reported to the PSNI, who have the power to address these issues.The principal of Down High School, Mrs Maud Perry, said that she was aware of the issue.ldquoThe safety of pedestrians and road users is of utmost importance. Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

Bryansfordrsquos Chris Brannigan was the lsquogo torsquo man for vital scores and Carryduffrsquos Ronan Lawlor won a Colleges All-Star award that year.Previous wins in the competition came in ,  and  with the teams of lsquo and lsquo going on to win the All Ireland Collegesrsquo B final.Cathair Dhoire may not have the same sort of identity or history as the Red High, but they will still be a tough nut to crack.The Red Highrsquos campaign didnrsquot start that well and they lost their opening group game - to - when Our and Lady and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, edged past them by the narrowest of margins.They picked up a bit of momentum following a comprehensive - to - victory over St Patrickrsquos, Keady.This was followed up by a - to - win over St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, before a - to - extra-time victory against St Malachyrsquos, Castlewellan, in the quarter-finals.St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, were their semi-final opponents, but they were no match for the Red High flair and went down - to -.Meanwhile, Cathair Dhoire enjoyed wins over Our Ladyrsquos, Castleblaney, Our Ladyrsquos and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, and Inis Eoghan, Donegal, on their way to the final. In addition, the St Columbrsquos players in the squad were also involved with their schoolrsquos senior team that won this seasonrsquos Markey Cup.The Derry side are blessed with a plethora of talented players, none more so than Ben McCarron, a highly-rated forward who played for his county in this yearrsquos McKenna Cup.St Patrickrsquos will look to their defensive markers, Eoin Rooney and Jack Harbinson, while skipper Ronan Murphy, Ciaran Watson and Peter McMullan will hope to turn defence into attack.Murphy is really looking forward to the final and believes that his team-mates have all the hard yards done in training.ldquoWe are really looking forward to the final. This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do. They obviously have good players to get this far with a few lads who have won Ulster Colleges All Star awards and played senior football for Derry, so, we know they are pretty decent.He continued: Getting to the final has created a real buzz and itrsquos infectious. Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do. We have invested a lot in this squad and they have responded brilliantly.ldquoHowever, there is no guarantee in football and know we have a lot to do to get our hands on the cup, he added.ldquoWe havenrsquot mentioned the fact that we are already through to the All-Ireland Collegesrsquo B semi-finals, regardless of Mondayrsquos outcome, as amalgamated schools are unable to compete in that competition.ldquoThe boys are focused totally on winning on Monday and they will not be taking their eye off the ball.The final is still a long way off for several players who face a weekend of action in other sports.ldquoWe canrsquot wrap up the boys in cotton wool, but I will be on the phone on Saturday night to several of the players to ensure they havenrsquot picked up any injuries, Mr Morgan said.ldquoHowever, we have a  strong  and they have all bought into the team ethos and our horses for courses policy.ldquoThe lads are so looking forward to the final and are fully aware of the schoolrsquos history in the competition.He added: Itrsquos been a while since the MacLarnon Cup was in Downpatrick, but I am convinced this squad can bridge that gap and bring the trophy back to the Red High for the first time in  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Michael’s are champions  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos wrapped up the - league title with two matches to spare when they overcame visiting St Patrickrsquos.

Those people talk of her apparent lack of remorse for joining Islamic State, which she did in  when she left her East London home as a -year-old and travelled to Syria. Others, including myself feel somewhat sympathetic towards her.I am abhorred by the views she holds but I donrsquot believe her decision to leave her home and her family and travel to Syria is a story without complexities. I see a vulnerable child who was radicalised by extremists while on British soil, in an area of East London I used to call home. I see a young teenager who was married to an IS fighter within two weeks of arriving in Syria and has been brainwashed perhaps beyond repair after witnessing levels of violence and destruction that most of us wouldnrsquot even be able to contemplate. But most tragic of all, I see a young mother who, at just  years of age, has lost three children in the space of four years. To me, thatrsquos an unimaginable level of trauma. And no, she doesnrsquot deserve it. No one deserves such pain.Irsquom not condoning her actions or her behaviour. She should face the legal consequences of her actions. She should be tried in a British court for the crimes she has allegedly committed. That is, after all, why we have the rule of law. But wiping our hands of her and failing to act to protect her son before he died of pneumonia in a grim refugee camp, shows just how much, as a country, the UK has lost its moral compass.Irsquove heard a number of commentators conflating her situation with that of the hundreds of innocent people whorsquove suffered at the hands of IS, particularly the vulnerable Yazidi women who were captured and are now being used as sex slaves. The dference, of course, is that they did not sign up to be a part of the caliphate, like Ms Begum. I am equally horried by the plight of these women and their children.But why do incidents such as this one always come back to whataboutery  Nothing was ever solved by this derailing and deflection technique. It is hypocritical to suggest we should have cared less about Ms Begumrsquos three-week-old baby than those captured or indeed killed by IS. Innocent people are innocent people and we should care equally about each and every one.Just because there are innocent victims still at the behest of ISIS does not negate the fact that the rights of a baby have been ignored and that child has now died, a death that couldrsquove been prevented by the Home Secretary, Savid Javid, had he chosen compassion and humanity over appeasement and pandering to rising populism.Indeed, Ms Begumrsquos case has highlighted a dilemma facing many countries in Europe, ided over whether to allow IS members or supporters to come home and face prosecution or block them. In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

BBC commentator Tony McWhirter, who won the European Cup with Ulster, summed up the game saying: “I’ll happily say that’s the best schoolboy performance in a final I’ve seen.“It bodes well for Ulster Rugby because there’s a lot of these guys have the talent and the ability to definitely make the next step.”Looking remarkably fresh just minutes after the game had finished, Methody captain Kevin McNaboe said: “Last time we won we were in second year maybe, watching the match here and saying that’ll be us hopefully in upper sixth, and finally we’ve made that happen so we’re delighted.”He added: “We’ve got a lot of talent all over the field.“We’ve a good year group, good lower sixth and fth years coming through as well.”Thomas Armstrong, having scored two of the best tries in Schools’ Cup final history, was modest about his eye-catching accomplishment: “We’re blessed to have talent all over the park. “The forwards give us the  to go forward, it’s all down to them really.”Coach Nick Wells said of his team: “These boys have a huge futurerugby is the path they choose to go down.”The Schools’ Cup competition, which began in , is the only competitive rugby played by the senior school teams in Northern Ireland.Books of condolence opened for teens killed in St Patrick’s disco tragedy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It borders Russia to the north and China to the east and has extensive oil reserves that make it strategically and economically important.Mr Nazarbayev came to power in  as its Communist Party chief when it was part of the Soviet Union, and was first elected president weeks before the  Soviet collapse.In those days, Kazakhstan was a backwater region best known for prisons, nuclear testing sites and being the home of the launch facility of the Soviet space programme, the Baikonur Cosmodrome.Mr Nazarbayev has been widely praised for maintaining stability and ethnic peace in Kazakhstan but has also faced criticism for marginalising the political opposition and creating what is effectively a one-party state.He has maintained a delicate balance between Russia and the West, leading Kazakhstan to join a Russia-dominated economic alliance of ex-Soviet nations, but cultivating close energy ties and other links with the West.He was lauded abroad for modernising the oil industry and his decision to give up the nuclear weapons Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union.In , he moved the countryrsquos capital from Almaty to the remote northern city of Astana in what was widely considered a way to fuse the ethnic-Russian minority in the north to the new Kazakh state.The new city was filled with post-modern architecture including the soaring glass pyramid of the Palace of Peace and Accord, dedicated to harmony among religious and ethnic groups.In , Mr Nazarbayev was awarded the title of Leader of the Nation, which comes with lelong immunity from prosecution and as-yet untested powers of veto over some government policies.He departs at a time of rare open protest against the government.He fired his prime minister and cabinet last month following a wave of protests by Kazakh women calling for more financial support for children and safer housing after a fire in which five children died.Soon after, he announced a programme of more generous spending for large families.He has extended his tenure by landslide victories in successive elections and plebiscites. He took nearly % of the vote in the most recent election, in , when he was elected for another five-year term.His resignation will set the stage for a potential battle between Russia and the US for influence with the successor government.Nursultan Nazarbayev with Vladimir Putin in  Vladimir Putinrsquos spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president had spoken with Mr Nazarbayev by telephone earlier on Tuesday but did not say what they discussed.Nazarbayev was born into a poor rural labourerrsquos family on July  . As a young adult, he worked in harsh conditions at a steel plantrsquos blast furnace and at  he joined the Communist Party.He worked his way up in the party, went to university and became known for his comparatively candid assessments of the Soviet Unionrsquos shortcomings.That turn of mind positioned him in the reformist camp that came to ascendancy when Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in .Mr Nazarbayev was the last of Central Asiarsquos former Communist Party bosses to remain in power after the deaths of Turkmenistanrsquos Saparmurat Niyazov in  and Uzbekistanrsquos Islam Karimov in .The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, is now the regionrsquos longest-serving head of state, having assumed power in  during a civil war..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Kazakhstan us president steps down after  years article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner.He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.After a buzzing sales ring it sold to the powerhouse Gigginstown stud, owned by the O’Leary’s of Ryanair fame, for a whopping £,.Michael recalls it wasn’t about the money. He has been a punter all his le and dreamed of owning a superstar.For him it was about seeing a stud which could develop his horse into a future star.Describing Battleoverdoyen’s style, Michael believes it is all in his stride.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

As a committee we want to reassure you all that we as a club will do all we can to help and support your kids andanyone wants to speak and seek help and support we’re here for you, so please speak up #itsgoodtotalk. Local girl Eimear Tallon summed up the incident in a moving and heartbreaking online blog.She wrote: “It started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started.“The people on the outside of this line were so determined to get in they felt the need to not only push us against the wall but push with all their strength. No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement.Teenage victims of the disco horror“Two of my friends fell to the ground. I tried to pull them up but at that point there was no room for them to even come back up. So I started screaming at the top of my lungs: “My friends are on the ground, move back!”“My friends have fainted, move back!” BM off to flying start as it open doors Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“My friends can’t breath, move back!”- nothing. Not one bit of movement.“I could still see people laughing with no idea what was going on. At this point I thought my friends were going to die, I was standing up and I couldn’t breath so I couldn’t imagine how they felt. I was hysterically screaming for people to move but it was only the people around me who knew the seriousness.“With more and more pushing, I also fell. But the thing about me was that I wasn’t on the ground, I was on top of someone, and this person was on top of someone . As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my le.“I was looking about for my friends and trying to keep my head up. As dramatic as it sounds, I closed my eyes for a little and accepted what was going to happen however, an elbow to my throat soon woke me up. People were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath. I think that’s what really shows the seriousness of it all, people were literally fighting for their lives.“It got to a point where even when I had my eyes open, I couldn’t see. It felt like this went on forever but eventually I felt bodies being dragged over me and beside me. It wasn’t the bouncers and it wasn’t the police, it was the young people in the line who pulled me out.“My leg was caught underneath someone and my hair was caught somewhere , my jeans were pulled down around my thighs and my jersey above my head but I was getting pulled out nonetheless. I lay on the ground and opened my eyes, I remember seeing some motionless legs, a few socks and shoes and then I was pulled up and brought away.“I rang my parents to explain what had happened and let them know I was okay, I then tried to find my friends. I ran about frantically. I seen a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I seen his friends screech as they found out he wasn’t going to make it.“I don’t think I will ever experience more relief in my le than when I seen one of my friends that had fallen, I was shocked she was alive. We all eventually found each other apart from my other friend that had fallen. We heard people had seen him, that he was roughed up but he was okay, I needed to see him myself though. He then came running towards us sobbing and all we could do was hug him.“These ‘people’ aren’t just ‘people’, they were young people, teenagers at   years old. They were only children.“It could’ve been anyone.“Unfortunately, a friend of mine who I had seen in the line and chatted to minutes beforehand has died. Morgan and the two other angels, just like the rest of us, left their families last night for an enjoyable night out but unlike the rest of us, they didn’t make it home. My heart breaks for their poor families.“There is no sugar coating what happened last night. As it got serious, we banged the windows of the hotel and tried to get help. The people inside simply looked away. While this was happening the gates were still locked and the bouncers were no help. If it wasn’t for the young people doing the right thing and ringing the police, the situation could’ve been so much worse.“The truth is, this could’ve been prevented. I’m heartbroken.”try catch  TrendingNathan Ward given minimum -year term for murdering nurse Jayne Toal-ReatEmergency closure of Co Armagh road in high windsCall for drivers to take care as wall collapsed onto roadRoad to be closed for pound, resurfacing schemeJayne Toal Reat murder: lsquoSentence will never bring my mummy back,rsquo says heartbroken daughter*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

INLM-gcOften her fees were waived for those who might struggle to pay and the respect she was held in the town was unparalleled.Rosemary came to prominence as the solicitor for some high profile republicans, including Colin Duffy.She also represented the family of Robbie Hamill who was killed after a barbaric kicking in Portadown in .She also worked as a solictor for the Garvaghy Residents Association during the Drumcree disputes in Portadown in the late s.However the vast majority of her clients were ordinary local people.Rosemary was killed in March ,  after a bomb exploded under her car outside her home close to a local primary school in Lurgan.The murder was claimed by the loyalist gang, the Red Hand Defenders however there was widespread concern of security force collusion in the murder.Mrs Nelson had previously complained that she had received numerous death threats and had voiced these concerns with the United Nations and US Congress.A public inquiry into her murder found no evidence that the security forces had ‘directlly facilitated’ her murder but ‘could not exclude the possibility’ that inidual members had helped the perpetrators.On her th anniversary her children paid tribute to their mother.In a statement on Friday they said: “Today marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

Even in her younger years she noted that the odds were stacked, but that didn’t stop her from hurtling towards opportunities and dismantling the obstacles anyway – for herself, and others, too.“For those who witnessed Rosemary in a professional setting, it was her steely faith which drew attention – that unfaltering conviction which commanded her working days. She instilled belief in her clients, and they in turn placed their confidence in her. “When it comes to the many at the receiving end of Rosemary’s help, it’s hard to determine just what their lingering memories are – but perhaps that’s the point. Through the power of her compassion, the four walls of the Lurgan office transformed into a confidential haven whereupon sadness was shielded fears unleashed and faith restored.“But for those closest to Rosemary – and lucky enough to occupy that special, padlocked component of her heart – she was so, so much more. “She sprinkled her laughter and zest-for-le passion upon any occasion, and set more than one meal alight during her cooking forays.“Though Rosemary’s driving was impressive, her sense of direction left a lot to be desired, and the sounds of the Lighthouse Family and Mary Black were the backdrop of choice to any long journey.“She loved her family and friends fiercely, and through her parents, siblings, husband, and children, her greatest fuel was forged.“And as the darkness of each night reared, Rosemary gathered her children before her as she wiped off her make-up chatting, laughing, and ensuring that a reaffirmation of love lulled them off to a peaceful sleep.“Today on the th anniversary, we’re hugely saddened as we reflect on the loss of Rosemary’s le. We grieve for the milestones which we should have shared the lessons which we were yet to learn the unwritten chapters which lay before us with hope and expectation.“But mostly we’re grateful for the blessings which Rosemary’s letime brought us. And as we continue to pave our own paths, we will always take fuel from her, just as she did from us.“Thank you, mum. We miss you.”Also on her anniversary some of her colleagues paid tribute to Mrs Nelson.KRW Law Human Rights said: “Thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of our esteemed professional colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.”Madden  Finucane Solicitors said: “Fond memories of our friend and colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.T”oday marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
