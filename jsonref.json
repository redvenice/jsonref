The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow.

But the prime minister says Australia will continue negotiations with other parties.“There is no guarantee that this, or any other, vaccine will be successful, which is why we are continuing our discussions with many parties around the world while backing our own researches at the same time to find a vaccine,” Morrison said in a statement.The government proposes to sign a letter of intent with AstraZeneca and enter a consumables contract with Becton Dickinson for the supply of needles and syringes. The total cost of the program is likely to be in the billions of dollars.The government says the initial agreements will cover vaccine development, production and distribution, and it will contain a commitment to produce the vaccine locally. Subsequent agreements will include distribution, timing and the price of the vaccine.Australia’s largest biotechnology company, CSL, has confirmed it is in discussions with AstraZeneca and the government concerning local production of the Oxford vaccine, as well as continuing work on another candidate under development at the University of Queensland.A statement from CSL said: “Development of the UQ vaccine candidate remains CSL’s priority, however, we are currently in discussions with AstraZeneca and the Australian government to assess whether it is possible to provide local manufacturing support for the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine, should it prove successful, while protecting our commitment to the UQ vaccine.“We are assessing the viability of options ranging from the fill and finish of bulk product imported to Australia through to manufacture of the vaccine candidate under licence. There are a number of technical issues to work through and discussions are ongoing.”With the government signalling over the weekend that a deal on a vaccine was close, Labor said Morrison should increase the funding available to Australian researchers.“The state government is putting in double what the national government has done and there are other vaccines under development in Australia with zero government support and funding for Covid-19. Some of those may work.”Morrison has been stepping up public warnings in recent weeks that countries need to share any vaccine against the coronavirus that is found to be successful and safe through clinical trials. While declining to nominate which country or countries he might be referring to, the prime minister has said: “Any country that were to find this vaccine and not make it available around the world, without restraint, I think would be judged terribly by history and that’s certainly Australia’s view.”As well as working to secure supply for Australia, the government says it will work to ensure the Pacific and countries in south-east Asia have early access to a Covid vaccine.Australia has submitted a non-binding expression of interest to join the World Health Organisation’s “Covax” program, which is an international collaboration to combat so-called “vaccine nationalism”. The program has the aim of securing two billion doses of a Covid vaccine by the end of next year.More than 160 candidate vaccines are currently under development. Trials of the Oxford vaccine are expected to run through 2020 into 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66061ac51770f1b45b2267e74f35bf287cfddf16/0_1081_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b4498246e94f9dd719d3a9659b55d3b","title":"spellbook forms part of exhibition of hebrew works at british library","story":"Show delayed by lockdown set to open at London library in SeptemberLike any good spell book it’s got all the important magical recipes how to escape demons, obviously, as well as safe travel, catching thieves, successful love-making, and the more mundane problems of how to overcome fever, diarrhoea and swallowing a bone.Now the small 16th-century spellbook containing 125 recipes is about to go on public display at the British Library as part of its delayed Hebrew Manuscripts exhibition.The library has a rich and wonderful collection of more than 3,000 Hebrew manuscripts and, before lockdown hit, completed a six-year project to digitise them.“It was an extremely demanding and challenging initiative, but we are so proud to have accomplished it,” said the curator, Ilana Tahan. “We wanted to celebrate that by exhibiting a selection of manuscripts, some of which have never been on public display before.”The plan was to open the show in March. It will open to members this week and to the general public on 1 September.About 40 manuscripts will go on display, dating as far back as the 10th century and ning science, religion, law, music, philosophy, alchemy and Kabbalah. And magic, of which the spellbook is a good example. “It is a charming little manuscript with 125 magic recipes. It is so sweet and has some beautiful decorations.”Among the spells is one “to increase love between bridegroom and bride”, which involves writing their names in honey on to two sage leaves and giving them each other to eat. “I dare anyone to try it,” said Tahan.To catch a thief, simply write the names “Kematin kanit kukairi ve-hikani yazaf” on kosher parchment and hang from the neck of a black rooster. Circle around suspects and the rooster will jump on the head of the thief.To make yourself invisible, burn the skin of a snake in March and sprinkle the ashes in your eyes. People can use those same ashes if you meet a king – simply hold in your hand and they will heed your words.And for a person who has swallowed a bone, the spell reads: “One who swallowed a bone, take a bone of the same kind and place it over his head without his knowledge, then whisper the following: nehash, nehash, har, har, mena’, mena’, tsa, tsa. And it is tested.”Another highlight of the show will be documents shining light on Moses Maimonides, a 12th-century Jewish philosopher who was born in Cordoba, Spain, and went on to become the spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Egypt, where he was physician to the sultan, Saladin. He was the greatest Jewish polymath leader of the middle ages, his name known across Europe.Thousands of Jews wrote to Maimonides asking for advice and legal rulings. The exhibition has a handwritten letter written by him in Arabic, but in Hebrew script, to a teacher who needed specific help.Tahan said the teacher taught two young girls in a remote Jewish community in Egypt. “For some reason, which is not quite clear from the documents – maybe somebody said something derogatory about him – he took an oath to stop teaching the two girls. In those times, when you took an oath, you stuck to it.”But the teacher felt the girls were missing out on an education, so he evidently wrote to Maimonides asking how to go back on the oath. He replied that the teacher needed to get three Israelite witnesses to cancel the oath. “He was always pragmatic. He always thought of how he could help someone and not put them through a very complicated process.”Also on display is the earliest dated (1380) copy of Maimonides’ Guide for the Perplexed, considered to be be his most significant philosophical work.The story of Maimonides also speaks to more harmonious times between Muslim and Jewish communities. “When Maimonides passed away, not only Jewish communities mourned him, but also all the Muslims in the city came to mourn him,” said Tahan. “He was known across Europe and across the three main faiths.”Other highlights include a letter written to Henry VIII by an Italian rabbi in 1530 regarding biblical laws that could support the king’s claim to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.The opening of the Hebrew Manuscripts exhibition is part of the next phase of the British Library’s gradual reopening after lockdown.Also reopening on 1 September is the Treasures gallery, which includes objects ranging from Leonardo da Vinci’s sketchbooks to Andrea Levy’s working drafts for Small Island and The Long Song.• Hebrew Manuscripts 1 September-11 April 2021 at the British Library."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff2359cc5d1086ab918848df60bbce4b2b24862/0_0_2339_1403/master/2339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c785334d9c84bc35dd635cb936756e5c","title":"former chancellor sajid javid role jp morgan adviser us bank mp conservative","story":"Conservative politician will work as adviser at US bank while continuing as an MPThe former UK chancellor Sajid Javid has been hired as a senior adviser to JP Morgan in a return to his career in banking.Javid resigned in February after Boris Johnson asked him to sack all of his advisers in a move by No 10 to seize control of the Treasury.

But they certainly make life easier for higher education institutionsThe stories were heartbreaking the sense of injustice utterly profound. The government had little choice but to U-turn on its decision to use an algorithm to dish out A-level “results” to thousands of young people that had bafflingly little connection to their ability or the quality of their work. But in announcing this without setting out a plan for what it means for university admissions – some institutions will now be massively oversubscribed in terms of places, others undersubscribed – it has simply pushed the problem elsewhere.Step back, and this whole fiasco exposes some uncomfortable truths about how fair the system is normally, and the true extent of and limits to meritocracy. We take it as given that dropping a couple of grades in a one-off exam should amount to the be-all and end-all in determining which university you go to. Have a good exam day, and you could be attending the university of your dreams have a bad day and the anxious cycle of clearing starts. All this is predicated on the crazy idea that we need to avoid AAA students studying with ABB students, BBC students studying with BCD students at all costs or … what?Rankings allow illusions of meritocracy and simple choices to prevail – obviously we should go for the AAA student over the ABB one – when the reality is they may be covering up a choice that is more random and arbitrary than we may like to think.A-levels may be great at ranking the ability of students to take a particular exam on a given day. But how useful is that for predicting how well they will do at university, sometimes in an entirely unrelated subject? Or in any given job? There will be some link, but is it strong enough to justify a university system in which dropping a single grade can close off entry to your first choice?If exams aren’t perfect, perhaps there are other ways of assessing students. But the other options all come with their own problems. Teacher-based assessment tends to be biased against young people from disadvantaged backgrounds coursework can be a more accurate assessment of a teacher’s willingness to coach the work out rather than a student’s true ability. There simply is no such thing as a perfectly accurate method for ranking young people’s abilities that works for everything from university entry to job recruitment.That’s only bad news if we consider a failsafe assessment of a young person’s future abilities at the end of school as the alpha and omega of the education system. But why should it be? Why do universities and employers even need this in the first place?It’s only important for universities if we believe that it is paramount that the young person who gets BBC in their A-levels should not study alongside the young person who gets BCC: that they must to be sorted into different institutions. To see how bizarre this is look at the school system, where experts have shunned the use of academic selection in light of evidence that creaming off the most able children into separate schools does barely anything for their learning and simply worsens outcomes for everyone else.Yet for some reason, when it comes to post-18 education, we turn this on its head and go for extreme levels of academic stratification – which, because children from more affluent backgrounds are much more likely to attend good-quality schools, also produces a highly socially stratified university system. You get tutors worrying about whether a student has the ability to complete a course at their university if they’ve dropped a couple of grades, without ever wondering whether this says a whole lot more about the quality of teaching at their institution than the student in question. (It absolutely does.)This system works brilliantly for the most selective universities, who get to select the highest A-level performers who hail disproportionately from affluent backgrounds, then claim the kudos when – surprise, surprise! – those students go on to do well. But it also fuels unjustified elitism. Because universities essentially mark their own homework – a first from one university is not equivalent to a first from another – employers tend to use the university someone attended as a shorthand for their labour market potential, rather than the skills they actually developed there. The prophecy becomes self-fulfilling. We couldn’t design a better way to entrench privilege if we tried.Employers also deserve more scrutiny. Traditional recruitment includes screening CVs – with A-levels and degrees a key filter for entry-level jobs – followed by an interview. Not only is this method ineffective at selecting the best people for the job, it can be downright counterproductive. Experimental studies have shown that interviewers are notoriously unreliable at predicting someone’s capabilities. And interviews are a reliable way to smuggle bias into the process: interviewers tend to go for candidates that look and think like them, leading to less erse, more groupthink-dominated – and less successful – workplaces.One real-world example comes from Texas in the late 1970s, where a doctor shortage pushed politicians to instruct the state medical school to increase its admissions after it had already selected 150 applicants after interview. It took another 50 candidates who had been rejected at interview – after much of that pool had already been snapped up by other universities. Those 50 went on to perform just as well clinically and academically as the original crop: their success at interview made no difference at all they might as well have been picked from the shortlist at random.We don’t need A-level results to provide a high-stakes ranking. If we were more honest about the limits of meritocracy, we would move to a more comprehensive-style university system – where, like at school, young people of different abilities learn alongside each other, with real academic benefit. More large employers would disregard A-level grades and degrees, running aptitude tests and assessment centres to assess the skills relevant to their workplaces, randomly selecting from those candidates who make a cut-off to ensure a more erse intake than interviewing could ever allow. We have extensively debated the fairness of an algorithm, but let’s not fail to ask why we even needed one in the first place. The real reason is that the system as it stands shores up elitism and maintains the grip that the upper middle class – for no good reason – has on influential jobs. But this weak attempt to fake meritocracy is a harmful pretence that denies too many young people a chance in the first place.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and a  and Observer columnist• This article was amended on 18 August 2020.

What is also clear is that, as the recent difficulties around A-level results have highlighted, the near complete shutdown of school in March, during the early stages of the pandemic, meant that children and young people have been disproportionately affected by the lockdown relative to their risk of disease.However, the more challenging question – and one that has been causing a headache for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the government – is whether the full reopening of schools is a risk to the UK’s control of the pandemic.Here the science is less certain, but emerging evidence does suggest the risk is manageable, and of much less harm than keeping schools closed. Findings from the recent PHE study are an encouraging start – during the pandemic first wave children with flu-like symptoms (who of course should not be attending school anyway) are much less likely to be shedding the Covid-19 virus than adults. Also, even if young people infect their classmates, their classmates are unlikely to become unwell.But the greater concern is whether children and teenagers with no symptoms could be shedding it, unknowingly creating a pool of virus circulation responsible for infecting adult staff members and spreading it into new households. It is certainly true that many (probably most) childhood infections with the Covid-19 virus cause no symptoms. In an ongoing antibody study we have shown that up until the end of July, approximately one in 25 healthy 0- to 19-year-olds had experienced a Covid-19 virus infection, but under a third of these had any respiratory or flu-like symptoms. So, yes, there is a chance that students will attend school while being unknowingly infected with the virus.Just how likely this is has been the study of speculation this week based on unpublished data from a school-based, PHE swabbing study, with reports suggesting that very few children attending reopened primary schools at the end of the last academic year had detectable virus. Given the very limited reopening of secondary schools before the summer holidays the situation in teenagers is less certain. However reports from the Office for National Statistics have consistently shown that, even with schools closed, approximately one in 300 children and teenagers with no symptoms had the Covid-19 virus detectable on nasal swabs from April to July, similar to rates in those aged 50 and above.But having detectable virus is not the same as being infective to others. Here the experience of Sweden is useful: it has kept schools open for under 16-year-olds during the pandemic, and found that infection rates in teachers were no higher, and were often lower, than other occupational groups. Clearly many other variables could be at play here (teachers may, for example, be younger or healthier than the other occupational groups), but this does provide some reassurance that students are not efficient spreaders of coronavirus. The need for continuing surveillance and vigilance is highlighted by recent outbreaks such as the one at an overnight youth camp during June in the US state of Georgia (in which at least 260 of 597 attendees tested positive for Covid-19), however it is to be hoped that risk management within schools will avoid the “daily vigorous singing and cheering” that may well have contributed to this.As with many aspects of the pandemic, there is no perfect answer, but the opening of schools must be a priority for the coming academic year. Moving into autumn, as the effects of other lockdown-easing measures are felt, it is inevitable that the plan will coincide with an increase in Covid-19 cases. Equally inevitably this will be accompanied by calls to revert to a school shutdown. Fortunately the evidence base on which to make any such decisions is building by the day, and it is to be hoped that any further restrictions would only be used as a last resort, and only if there is clear evidence that they are of benefit.Children and teenagers have already had to sacrifice a significant amount of their education for an illness they rarely suffer from we now all need to remember our obligation to make their continued wellbeing and development our priority.• Matthew Snape is associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, and the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre he is chief investigator on the What’s the STORY (Serum testing of Representative Youngsters) study, evaluating the proportion of children and teenagers with antibodies against the Covid-19 virus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecdc58fd80ee72c44d4d0e6e65b0743479aae407/0_167_5484_3290/master/5484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aa23fe16b96b17b620cccc5d83ec15e","title":"climate change covid 19","story":"The existential emergencies we face require a wholesale reimagining of how we live, work and play in urban spacesIt’s often been said that we’re living through an unprecedented moment. But in city centres, the coronavirus crisis has merely accelerated trends that have been unfolding for some time. In Leeds, where I live, many major banks and building societies, cinemas, shops and department stores declined or disappeared as society shifted online. The pandemic has caused the job market to contract, and many more people are now working from home. But in cities across the country, traditional office spaces have long been shrinking, as technology reduces the need for face-to-face contact and a growing number of self-employed people opt for co-working spaces.Despite the economic boom that some UK cities have experienced in the last 20 years, the centre of Leeds, like many other city centres, has not yet recovered from industrial decline. Vacated banking halls have supplied glamorous homes for bars and restaurants in regeneration areas, and housing has returned to the centre, albeit in the limited form of small apartments and poorly designed student accommodation. But the continuing trend of “meanwhile use” and sprawling ground-level car parks across the city are evidence that supply still exceeds demand.Coronavirus has accelerated these processes, but they aren’t new. Neither is Leeds a novice in dealing with pandemics the Spanish flu of 1918, which infected one in three people in the city, overwhelmed its hospitals, closed its schools and created shortages of grave diggers. What’s new about Covid-19 is that it coincides with another existential crisis – the climate emergency – and that we’ve made extraordinary technological advances since 1918.City centres will struggle in the short term with the effects of the pandemic, and a great number of service workers will be unemployed. This is a tragedy, but it’s also an incentive to plan for medium- and long-term solutions. In the past, disasters have been the bedrock of social progress, not least in the creation of the National Health Service in 1948. And what’s good for dealing with the impacts of Covid-19 is also good for addressing the impacts of climate change.Work on climate mitigation and adaptation has already paved the way for how our city centres should change, and has supplied the technologies to make this possible. In Leeds, Covid-19 should be an opportunity to accelerate what has already been planned to address the climate emergency, such as installing a cycling network in the city centre that connects to surrounding neighbourhoods, and engaging the community in planting 1m trees.This green infrastructure is crucial for bioersity, carbon capture, water management, temperature cooling and wellbeing. It’s the first step towards remodelling our urban environments as “15 minute cities”, a concept first promoted in Paris, which aims to provide all necessary services required for the health and wellbeing of its residents within 15 minutes’ walking distance. In the past, green infrastructure has also been a response to public health concerns: Central Park in New York was developed following a prolonged outbreak of cholera, and Victoria Park in east London, the city’s first purpose-built park, was opened as a response to insanitary conditions, overcrowding and pollution in the city’s East End.But we need to go further. We should be using public investment to build networks of new parks with playgrounds and sport and leisure facilities on underdeveloped sites in city centres. Providing this green infrastructure in our city centres would attract families to live there, and compel businesses to follow. Of course, there will be a time lag between the immediate effects of coronavirus and delivering on these ambitious plans. But I’m optimistic that in this period we’ll see a burst of creativity, of the sort that often emerges from the collapse of outmoded systems.Empty and cheap space may attract new users and institutions, as it did most notably in Detroit after the demise of its car industry. In UK cities, unused office spaces could be converted into modern family homes in Leeds, Park Square, a handsome Georgian area that was repurposed into offices could be returned to its original residential use. Defunct shopping centres could become sites for new nurseries and community centres. Our coronavirus retrofit should be the work of many hands, a sensitive process of rebuilding cities so they’re durable, equitable and sociable places to live and work, capable of dealing with the twin emergencies of the pandemic and climate crisis.• Irena Bauman is a director at Bauman Lyons Architects, Leeds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b0da356ed1c3942dae5fbd3a742c0ba332a35d6/0_167_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff0b719259a6663c74f267ea9fe6af82","title":"results u turn education","story":"The government’s A-level U-turn is welcome. But the roots of the scandal are in a two-tiered approach to schoolsAhead of GCSE results on Thursday, the government has announced all A-level and GCSE marks will be based on teacher assessments rather than the controversial algorithm. It is a welcome U-turn, although it does little to address the underlying issue. This was always a clear-cut matter of class: private schools uniquely benefited from the statistical model used to replace A-levels last week, increasing the proportion of students achieving top grades – A* and A – twice as much as pupils at comprehensives.You only have to see the heartbroken teenagers posting on social media to understand the pain of these past few days: working-class young people who had their dream future in front of them only to lose it because they live in the wrong postcode. These pupils deserved justice, the government is right to fix the system in England just as the devolved nations have pledged to.But it would be a mistake to treat this debacle as a one-off mistake that can be solved with a better grade calculator. The scandal is simply a blown-up version of the reality we’ve long known: working-class kids work hard and too often get tossed away, while private-school families buy their way in.Far from being wrong, the infamous algorithm in many ways succeeded in replicating the socio-economic bias that has plagued the education system for centuries. Or to put it another way: the educational inequality laid bare by the government’s incompetence is not a shock. It is business as usual.Just look at how the exam crisis is being discussed. The focus in much of the media has been on A* students missing out on a place at Oxbridge (perhaps in part because much of the media followed this route themselves) with barely any attention on working-class teenagers who hoped to go straight into employment or on the fact that the proportion of people awarded grade C and above fell most in deprived areas. Even the supposedly comforting claim that “exams don’t matter” is steeped in privilege. It is easy to say grades are irrelevant if you have parents with connections and a flat in London, but considerably harder if you’re at your local comp in a low-income town.During the pandemic, we have seen the class ide in education play out in new ways. Nearly two-thirds of private schools already had platforms for online learning in place before lockdown, compared with just a quarter of the most poorly funded state schools. While the wealthy have had laptops and reliable broadband to keep learning, the poorest children haven’t even had breakfast.Inequality does not typically come with fanfare. It isn’t usually a headline-grabbing scandal or a resignation matter. It is constant, accepted, hardwired into society. The exam fiasco is a shameful mess for which the government must make amends.

And it makes sense for their employers, tooKyle Lawrence, 22, from Essex, is an apprentice at a logistics company, working to move clothes around the world. “We bring things in from east Asia and get everything booked into containers or on a plane,” he says. With the office closed and some ports shut, it’s perhaps a job you’d most expect to have been strongly affected by coronavirus. But he’s able to work from home and continue his learning via virtual workshops and webcam chats.Other apprentices are having similar experiences. Sophie Bettelley is an apprentice nurse with Northamptonshire health and care partnership. She’s glad to be able to continue doing phone consultations during the pandemic. Bettelley has been ringing people who are at high risk to check if they have access to food. “There’s a lot of pressure but it’s a privilege to be able to help,” she explains.Doing an apprenticeship can be a good way to weather the coronavirus downturn. Apprentices are recruited throughout the year, so if you’re not sure about university, there’s no harm taking your time and waiting to see what comes up. A lot of employers have furloughed their HR departments and as they start to come back on board, more jobs are likely to be advertised.But not all industries are secure and apprentices are employees, so they are subject to the same issues as other working people. Currently, those employed in the motor, retail and hospitality sectors are most at risk – though this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ve been made redundant.According to David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, many companies will not be recruiting as many apprentices as normal. “We expect young people seeking apprenticeships to find it much more difficult this year, but are working hard to secure opportunities with employers,” says Hughes.With more than 100 universities now offering degree apprenticeships, Mark Dawe, CEO of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers thinks this could be the safe option. “A lot of these degree-level apprenticeship programmes are in the core of the business where they will still want to be recruiting,” he says.“Getting an apprentice is much better value to the business than someone coming in cold with a degree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e3c564aad2d1d0a50954fcd5f40ec210d79eda/0_245_4794_2876/master/4794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f696528d1941b42607eecd278403697","title":"starting secondary school during a pandemic what parents need to know","story":"New year 7s will have missed out on rites of passage and been unable to visit their new school. But there are silver liningsThe good news – and more than good, in some ways it feels miraculous – is that 11-year-old Phoebe South is genuinely looking forward to starting secondary school in September. “I feel quite excited about it now,” she tells me, from a beach in Devon where she’s on holiday with her family. “I know one of my best friends is going to be in the same bubble as me, and I know quite a lot about what to expect.”That she feels this way is tribute to all the work of her new school, Wykham Park academy in Banbury, Oxfordshire, to prepare for the influx of year 7 students in a few weeks’ time. Transition to secondary school can be difficult in the best of years – and 2020 is far from that.“By this stage in a normal year the new year 7s would have been into school to look round for a couple of days,” says Justine Williams, senior assistant principal at Wykham, who leads on transition. “They’d have met their teachers, and they’d have met the other pupils in their groups. They’d have tried the food and found out where the toilets are, and their parents would have been in for a meeting and to hear about what to expect.”As much as possible of this has gone ahead – but online. “We had a virtual parents’ evening, we’ve made videos about the different departments, and we’ve even managed to film a student’s eye view of what to expect, all of which is on our website. We’ve set fun transition projects for the pupils to do in subjects like art and science, and we’ve tried to answer as many questions as possible ahead of term starting,” Williams says.In some ways, the new protocols in place for the pandemic may make life less stressful than usual for the new intake. “Our strategy this year is that pupils will stay in one area of the school, except for PE and sharp-tool subjects – so that may make it easier than usual as it means rather than pupils moving around 10 different areas in the school, they remain in one place and the teachers come to them,” says Williams.Looking for the silver linings, and remembering there is still lots to celebrate about starting at a new school, is key to making it work, says Deirdre Kehoe of Young Minds, the mental health charity, which has produced a guide to secondary transition.“Whether you’re a teacher or a parent, focus on what’s good about the current situation,” she advises. “Of course you’ve got to think about very practical things that are going to be different from usual – but this is such an important stage in a child’s life, and it makes a difference if we look forward to it and celebrate the rite of passage it represents.”Her advice is to concentrate on what is going to be the same as usual, rather than on what will be different. “They’ll still be travelling to school, still eating their packed lunches, still getting homework, still going to lessons.”In any classroom, two pupils on average have a diagnosed mental health condition – and on top of this there are children with other mental health challenges. Added to which, the pandemic has meant that many of them will have found it more difficult than usual to access help.This is why, says Kehoe, schools’ focus must be on wellbeing, especially for the first term. “They need to concentrate on getting used to their new school, and to making friends, without the level of pressure there might normally be on academic attainment.”Given that the new year 7 cohort didn’t get the chance to take their Sats, tests for academic ability will be more important than usual this year – but it seems most schools are taking a “softly, softly” approach. At Wykham Park, the usual reading comprehension tests will take place, “but not immediately – everybody needs to settle in first”, Williams says.Keziah Featherstone, head of a large Midlands comprehensive school, says she expects most schools will do some kind of assessment for year 7s – some formalised tests, others more discreet checks. “We’ll be doing both, and lots of settling in and feeling happy,” she says. “I think there’s a growing sense that we’ll be kind and nurturing but get back to learning routines as soon as possible.”Lynne Hipkin, a clinical psychologist working with school-age children, says the pandemic has underlined the role of teachers as key figures of stability and support. So getting back to normal in the classroom will be important for the wider society as well as inside schools, she says.She emphasises how important it is to keep children at the centre of what is happening. “Communication and curiosity are key: be guided by your child, be curious,” she says. “Keep an open mind – let them tell you what’s going on rather than anticipating how they feel.”Another crucial element, as pupils prepare to go back to school, is for teachers to remember that everyone’s experience of Covid-19 will have been different.“We’ve all been travelling through the same storm, but in very different boats,” says Hipkin. “How children feel about the new measures will vary very widely. Some will feel a much greater responsibility for safety and hygiene measures and be much more preoccupied with them, than others. Some will think things are basically OK, some will think they are far from OK.“What matters most is being conscious of what’s going on inside children’s heads as we go into the new term. Because this year, change is doubled: there’s the transition to secondary school, but also the transition back into school.”Dr Rina Bajaj, of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, says experiences of the pandemic can be put to positive use. “Teachers in schools can talk to pupils about how they adapted to the lockdown, what helped them to get through. If they’re encouraged to reflect and build on their strengths and what they found out about themselves, they’ll learn things about resilience.”The Anna Freud centre has produced a guide, Managing the Transition Back to School, packed with tips. “Traditionally, the focus in schools has been on academic attainment – but growing up is also about how to engage with relationships and life,” says Bajaj. In this vein, it’s a good time for teachers and parents to make sure they’re role-modelling self-care, she says. “Young people watch us – they see us more than they hear us. We need to practice good stress management: we need to exercise, to take breaks, to eat well, to relax. And if we’re anxious we need to name that – because anxiety in some circumstances is normal.”On top of which, this year’s cohort will have missed out on so many of the rites of passage that should mark this stage of their lives: end-of-term parties, leavers’ assemblies, saying goodbye to primary school teachers. “All that didn’t happen for Phoebe, and she was really upset and confused by it,” says Naomi South, her mother. “So it was lovely when her new school started to do all the virtual preparation. It’s not been ideal, of course – but it has made her feel a whole lot better about what’s ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53840a3d44fcb1766161a2f372574dbb730ed85/0_147_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c847ef98e0643ad28549a461f17dcd","title":"from farm to factory the unstoppable rise of american chicken","story":"How industrial chicken farming transformed an ‘alternative’ meat to the most consumed meat in the USA century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy.How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat?The story starts with corn.At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing.“Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand.“It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry.During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place.Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out.“In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat.Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird.These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits.For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken.But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling.Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat.The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white  rock.The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions.The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants).The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds.White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers.Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly.Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach.With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifes, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date. Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry.“If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken.As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering inidual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross.Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store).In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world.“Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.”Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.”Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961.But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end.The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the .While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown.Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices.“We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw.The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers.People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts.Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines.Meanwhile, farmers who had ersified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips.While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.”He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common.“When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK.Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b51417ea869ca6fdaa09d180d68a0c5113c432/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cec489095df58c6a5bbcdb7c44d04e0","title":"dayot upamecano rb leipzig psg potent strike force champions league","story":"Young French defender is also an astute force in launching attacks as RB Leipzig hope for Champions League upsetWhat a scrumptious irony it would be if, after years of domination in Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain were to be thwarted in Europe by a French opponent. Lyon could sicken them in the Champions League final but that is unlikely, not least because it depends on Lyon getting past Bayern Munich in Wednesday’s semi-final. A more plausible scenario, however, is PSG being frustrated in the other semi-final by Dayot Upamecano, the Frenchman who leads RB Leipzig’s defence.Upamecano was born and raised in Évreux, Normandy, where his childhood playmates included Ousmane Dembélé, now of Barcelona. Unlike Dembélé, Upamecano, who is 21, has yet to be capped by France even though he has long been identified as a top talent.Manchester United may not be where they are today if they had managed to convince him to sign when he was 16: after being shown around Old Trafford in 2015 the defender was on the verge of moving to England but changed his mind at the last minute, when his parents decided he would be better off at Red Bull Salzburg, from where he joined Leipzig 18 months later.Although Upamecano was much bigger than his peers in his early teens and could bulldoze his way past opponents if he pleased, what really made him stand out was his finesse and intelligence. Those are the virtues that help make him such a commanding performer.In the quarter-final victory over Atlético Madrid he subdued his rivals while perpetrating only one foul – no mean feat when confronted by Diego Costa – but he also did much more than that. At Leipzig, to a greater extent than at most clubs, leading the defence also means launching attacks. Upamecano’s astuteness and his ability to open up opponents with dribbles and passing make him far more than a powerful stopper: he is an influential conductor.This is where the PSG-Leipzig match becomes so fascinating. There is little chance of Julian Nagelsmann doing a Pep Guardiola and suddenly sticking a straitjacket on his attack-minded team. So Upamecano and his fellow defenders will be encouraged to dash and probe as much as ever. Which will either hurt PSG or play right into their hands.With their own 21-year-old sensation, Kylian Mbappé, close to full fitness after an ankle injury, Ángel Di María back from suspension and Neymar in refulgent form and no doubt eager to shine even brighter in the wake of another wan surrender by Lionel Messi and Barcelona, PSG can start with awesome firepower.Mbappé’s speed will prove a particularly destructive weapon if PSG can beat Leipzig’s dynamic and clever press-swarm. Di María and, especially, Neymar can provide the ammunition from almost anywhere, as well as striking themselves. On the counterattack PSG could wreak havoc.The hardest part for PSG will be getting the ball to their attackers. Although Mbappé and Di María will return to the frontline, injuries have weakened them further elsewhere. The excellent schemer Marco Verratti resumed training on Sunday after calf trouble but casting him back into the action against opponents as vibrant as Leipzig is a risk Thomas Tuchel is unlikely to take.Same story for Idrissa Gueye, who is valued by the manager for his ball-winning prowess but suffered a muscle strain in training over the weekend. The most likely replacement for Gueye is Leandro Paredes, who is not as good at winning the ball as the Senegalese but, on the plus side, tends to use it better.PSG have a bigger worry at the back, since their goalkeeper Keylor Navas has been ruled out by the thigh injury that forced him off in the 79th minute of the quarter-final win over Atalanta. That win would not have been possible if Navas had not made a couple of excellent saves to keep the score down before PSG’s late comeback.The experienced Costa Rican will be replaced by Sergio Rico, who hardly imagined starting in a Champions League semi-final when he left Fulham after emphatic relegation from the Premier League 15 months ago.Rico is on loan at PSG from his hometown club of Sevilla, where he was once considered to be a future great and played in the triumphant 2015 Europa League final. But Sevilla lost faith in him after several costly mistakes, which is why he wound up at Fulham. PSG believe his class remains and, when he makes what will be his sixth start since joining last year, the goalkeeper is likely to be given plenty of opportunities by Leipzig to prove his worth.The first Champions League semi-final is not going to be boring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c623418253a487e51b6232153e41567dc65e69c/0_180_4073_2445/master/4073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0b1ffbb30b531584fdee2ddb86a142","title":"luka modric roman abramovich brought me onto his yacht and said sign for chelsea","story":"The Croatian recounts the secret discussion he had with Chelsea’s owner and which led to him handing in a transfer request at SpursWith the 2010-11 Premier League season over, I was ready for my summer vacation. But it didn’t last long, as my agents – Vlado Lemić and Davor Ćurković – passed on Chelsea’s wish to sign me. Before transferring to Tottenham, it had seemed I would move to Stamford Bridge. This new contact only added to the impression that Chelsea thought highly of me.I was open to the idea of moving, but then things happened at lightning speed. First, Vanja and I took a private jet from Zadar to Cannes, where my management team were waiting. Then, a van with tinted-glass windows took us to Nice, some 30km away. There we were picked up by Roman Abramovich’s security, who put us on a speedboat and took us to the Chelsea owner’s yacht.It was all very exciting. Twenty or so people, who seemed part of the security detail, met us at the boat. It was quick and well organised just as we made ourselves comfortable on one of the luxury decks, Abramovich showed up. He was accompanied by his wife Dasha and their son. I was fascinated by the discreet disappearance of all the security people just as he arrived. It was obvious they were well trained – their timing was perfect.I had met Abramovich only once before. I was watching Chelsea play against Atlético Madrid at Stamford Bridge and was seated close to his box. This is where we met and exchanged a couple of words. During our meeting on the Côte d’Azur, he left an impression of a relaxed, somewhat mysterious person. He wasn’t beating around the bush and said: “We know you are a quality player. I’d like you to sign for Chelsea.”I had come to his yacht to talk, so it was evident I wished the same. I had three successful seasons at Tottenham behind me. The club was now near the top of the Premier League, I had finally felt the pleasure of playing in the Champions League, and all the analysis showed I was one of the key players in the team’s rise. My feeling was that it was time for a move – I wanted to fight for trophies and win titles, and I felt this wouldn’t happen if I stayed at Tottenham. I wanted to move to a more ambitious club.“Do you think Tottenham will resist your transfer? Are they going to put up a fight?” Abramovich asked. “I think the negotiations are going to be tough,” I replied, because I knew the clubs were not on good terms.We finished our drinks and after 20 minutes or so, Abramovich and his wife discreetly retreated to their quarters. As he said goodbye, he suggested we relax and have a swim, but we thanked him and left. Within 90 minutes, we were back on the coast of Nice. We walked around the town a bit and then took a plane back to Zagreb. Both Vanja and I were impressed by the meeting, but deep inside I knew Tottenham’s chairman Daniel Levy wouldn’t want to hear about it.Before pre-season, English reporters called me and asked if it was true that I wanted to leave. I was honest, and probably naive, when I said I thought it was time for a step forward in my career. That created a lot of fuss, which didn’t quieten down until the end of the transfer window. Levy made a public statement saying that there was no chance of letting me leave and that I had a firm contract.I arrived in London before pre-season training and went to talk to the chairman. There were no harsh words or insults as the media said, but the conversation was tense. He reprimanded me for publicly announcing I wanted to leave and repeated that Tottenham had no intention of selling at any price. A stressful period followed. The media analysed my status daily Tottenham fans, understandably, resented that I wanted to leave. On the other hand, Harry Redknapp showed understanding for my situation in his public appearances.Redknapp was an experienced manager and he had seen it all, so he was aware of the opportunities open at a more ambitious club. He also knew he needed me, and, like any manager, he wanted a strong team. He did everything he could to please me and make me stay. During our pre-season tour in South Africa, he even made me captain. But my head just wasn’t there, so I handed in an official transfer request.Chelsea kept coming back with improved offers after Levy’s every rejection. All of this aggravated me. We played a home game against Manchester City, and Redknapp asked me to play. I told him I wasn’t focused and that I would rather not play. Redknapp insisted and, as he had always treated me well, I agreed. We lost 5-1 and I was replaced 60 minutes. It was one of my worst performances.Three days after the transfer window closed and, while I was with the Croatia national team, I realised my move wouldn’t happen. I returned to London with a clear idea: forget what had happened and get down to work.Redknapp had an even better idea. He played me in the very next game, and by the end of the 2011-12 season, I had played 90 minutes in all the matches, except against West Bromwich Albion when I came down with a virus. I had a great season. Unfortunately, a new campaign in the elite competition was taken from us because Chelsea, who ended sixth, won the Champions League. As defending champions, they qualified directly for the next season’s group stage, while Tottenham competed in the Europa League.I had a couple of meetings with Levy during that season. In January, he even came to my home and tried to talk me into extending my contract with Tottenham. It would’ve been my second extension. Among other things, Levy then told me he’d let me leave for an offer from a big club such as Real Madrid. I told him I wouldn’t sign anything. My main focus was to play well for Tottenham and to prepare for Euro 2012.Despite all the turbulence, I always had a good relationship with Levy. He was the one who brought me to Tottenham – for a record fee in the club’s history. That only showed how highly he thought of me. However, I resented him because on a couple of occasions he had promised to let me move to a bigger club and then broke his promise. For me, one’s promise and one’s word are more important than anything.I had proven myself as a player. I didn’t know where I would go from Tottenham. I didn’t know if and when Levy would agree to sell me. But I was convinced it was time to move on, to a new and bigger challenge. After four wonderful years, during which we felt at home in England, Vanja and I knew this life had come to an end.Extracted from Luka Modrić’s official autobiography Luka Modrić: My Autobiography which publishes on 20 August in hardback, £18.99.

Or at least replace the quality players who have left, and there have been quite a few. Sara Däbritz (PSG), Fridolina Rolfö (Wolfsburg), Jill Roord (Arsenal) and most recently the captain, Melanie Leupolz, (Chelsea) are among those who have departed.Players of that calibre are not easy to replace and there has been a change of manager too with Thomas Wörle leaving at the end of the 2018-19 season after nine years in charge. He was replaced by Jens Scheuer, who initially struggled to put his imprint on the team. For the first six months it was hard to see what the gameplan was. He experimented a lot but rarely was the attractive football he desires on display.However, since the restart things have changed notably. Bayern have been playing much more fluid football. Scheuer switched to four at the back for the most part and has made only small changes to the line-up. It will now be interesting to see how Scheuer integrates the new signings into his side.There are no new injuries to report. The goalkeeper Laura Benkarth was subbed off with a concussion last week, but should have recovered in time to feature against Lyon on Saturday. The German international Lea Schüller, who arrived from Essen this summer, should play her first game for the club and could prove vital up front.There are normally a lot of arrivals at Bayern each summer and 2020 has been no different. The club have brought in Schüller, Sarah Zadrazil (Turbine Potsdam), Viviane Asseyi (Bordeaux), Marina Hegering (Essen), Hanna Glas (Paris St-Germain) and Klara Bühl (Freiburg). The new arrivals are an intriguing mix of youth and experience. They may not be household names but they are all internationals.Hegering and Glas have come in to tighten up Bayern’s defence and the latter has started brightly in friendlies but Hegering has a niggling injury and may not be fit for the game against Lyon. The 18-year old Bühl, who scored Germany’s winner against England at Wembley last year, is the only player we are certain not to see in Spain for the resumption of the WCL as she is out with a shoulder injury.Scheuer did not play at a high level himself and started coaching in the lower leagues, often at clubs he had played for, before taking over the FC Freiburg Women’s team in 2015. He took the team to new heights and they finished third in the league in 2017-18 and reached the cup final the following year. Scheuer wants his team to play attractive football and would prefer a 4-3 win to a 1-0 win.This team is more about the collective but Simone Laudehr is certainly the most decorated player in the squad. She has won pretty much everything (apart from, strangely, the Frauen-Bundesliga). She has won the World Cup, the Euros and the Olympics with the German national team and the Champions League and the German Cup at club level. She started her senior career at Bayern Munich in 2003 but left the club after one season. After long spells with FCR Duisburg and FFC Frankfurt she returned in 2016. Not an automatic starter anymore but the club wants her around for at least another season to help the younger players.After 251 games and 13 years at the club, Carina Wenninger is currently Bayern’s second longest-serving player after Thomas Müller. She was born in Thal, the same village as Arnold Schwarzenegger, and moved to Munich at the age of 16. While becoming a footballer she has also continued to study and has a Bachelor in Fitness and Health management. She is now targeting a Masters in the subject.The midfielder Sydney Lohmann is a rough diamond that the club rates very highly and wants to protect. She suddenly developed into a starter after a long-term injury right at the beginning of the 2018-19 season. She has the capacity to become the next Melanie Leupolz, or indeed, Sara Däbritz.The quarter-final opponents, Lyon, are the toughest team to play and they come very early for Bayern. Having said that, with ties being played as one-off games an upset is possible. If you only have once chance you have to take it.Bayern Munich Women have been constant guests at the Champions League table since the 2015-16 season. Following two bitter knockouts at the early stages in 2015-16 against Twente and Chelsea in 2017-18, the team advanced to the semi-finals last year, but were then beaten by Barcelona."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ae51ccf796a3ccf6bdc5519d51a9c57783513a/0_0_714_428/master/714.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=475bbdb1bb91fe7f72035807d2c76486","title":"microsoft flight simulator review asobo","story":"PC (version tested)Xbox One (coming soon) MicrosoftAsoboThe perfect lockdown antidote: get in a plane and see New York, or the Amalfi coast, or the Himalayas, in eye-searing detail When the original Microsoft Flight simulator was released almost 40 years ago, it was very much for enthusiasts only. Early home computers could barely cope with drawing cockpit instrument panels, let alone scenery – so what you saw as you fought with the controls was a lot of dials and numbers, usually followed by an on-screen message politely informing you that you had crashed during take-off.This is not the experience you will have with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Developed by French studio Asobo using accurate geographic data culled from Bing Maps, a global cloud computing network, and real-time weather information, this is as much a visual spectacle as it is a simulator. And you will want to see as much as you can, because at 10,000 feet, the world looks spectacular (especially on the Ultra graphical settings, where it’s almost photorealistic). From craggy snow-topped mountain ranges to swooping desert valleys to bustling cities, the landscape is alive with detail.Without a moment’s airborne experience, you can access the world map on the introduction screen, pick a position and be dropped into a plane flying far above it. With all the many helpful assist options switched on, you can pilot your craft via joypad alone, your only concerns being altitude and air speed. Beneath you, a re-creation of the entire planet rolls by, so large that it would take 14 years of continuous play to see it all. One day, you may catch early morning sun beams rising along the Alps like searchlights, on another, you’ll see New York transform into a constellation of pin-prick stars as dusk drops and office lights take over every flight, a kind of holiday.But this is not a superficial flight sim. Far from it. Start switching off the automatic help, take control back from your AI co-pilot, and you have a rigorous, uncompromising simulation. Every flight is proceeded by lengthy engine and equipment checks and a 10-minute taxi to the runway take-off and landing are precise and demanding logistical exercises and flight paths are rigorously planned and adhered to. Eight tutorial flights provide a sense of the complexity to come, introducing the physics of flight and every instrument you’ll need to maintain it. You will learn how to use the yoke, trim and throttle, how to manoeuvre around an airfield, and how to get from one place to another using VFR navigation.And although you may start out crazily barrel-rolling a tiny Savage Cub propeller plane over Seattle, you will progress to piloting a Boeing 747-8, cruising at 35,000 feet, conversing with air traffic control, keeping a close eye on the beautifully replicated control panels, checking for warning lights. As fans of driving games such as Euro Truck Simulator have discovered, there is a sort of zen in simulated long-haul travel, a joy in mastering your role as driver or pilot so that it feels like you’re doing almost nothing – especially when you can pick out real-life scenic details en route.There are moments when the simulation falters. I’ve encountered areas of scenery where trees give way to acres of flat, low-resolution textures, which look ugly and out of place and although around 400 world cities have been accurately replicated using photogrammetry, others have been constructed using Bing Maps and AI, so that they resemble Lego-like model villages. Disappointingly, London is one of these, and its landmarks are blockily represented as a result. No doubt Asobo will be adding further to its list of fully replicated cities it is also allowing third-party modelling and simulation specialists to create and distribute their own city models using an in-game marketplace, so users will be able to populate their worlds with favourite locations (at extra cost, of course). But still, Flight Simulator is a true marvel and an astonishing use of Microsoft’s technological resources.In his wonderful book Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot, Mark Vanhoenacker writes, “Aeroplanes raise us above the patterns of streets, forests, suburbs, schools and rivers. The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful, and the visible relationships between them on the land, particularly at night, hint at the circuitry of more or less everything.” This is what Flight Simulator aspires to. During an early session in a Cessna 152, your instructor tells you that she wants to teach you the mindset of a pilot: you will certainly develop a fresh understanding of space, time and motion.There are specific flight challenges and missions to try out, and even a global scoreboard where you can match yourself against other pilots, but you never have to do any of this. You can merely pick a departure point and a destination, and fly along the Amalfi coast, or up over the Ural mountains you can cross the Atlantic, the Irish Sea or Lake Wakatipu. Wherever you go, this game captures the wonder of flight, and the spiritual and emotional rush of seeing the world in a different way.• Microsoft Flight Simulator is available now, free with Xbox Game Pass for PC or £60 (standard edition)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f6cae4aa30ad66dae5f17aa41a79fccca8945/0_187_1368_821/master/1368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24da72c75293e2b5ba43b34aa824b61f","title":"how we met he just grabbed me and gave me a big snog","story":"Lynn and Kim Davies, 53 and 54, found love on stage after their characters shared a kiss. They live together in a small Worcestershire villageLynn Davies moved to Worcestershire from Bristol in October 1999, trading in city life for a country village. “I was working as a freelance television writer. I wanted the chance to explore a rural lifestyle and find a real community,” he says. He had only been there for a few days, when a shopkeeper suggested he go to the village hall for a drama club meeting. He didn’t realise until he got there that it was an audition for a play.When he arrived, he spotted Kim Cresswell, who worked as a housekeeper at a country estate and had joined the group to meet new people. “I thought she was striking. But I couldn’t start chatting someone up the minute I’d arrived.” He submitted a form to join the group, and Kim noticed that he had trained at Lamda, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re having him. We won’t see anything like that in this village again.’”Before they knew it, they had both been cast in the play. “I’m not sure we’d even exchanged names before we had to rehearse this scene together,” Lynn recalls. It was a romantic scene, where the characters kissed. “He just grabbed me and gave me a big snog,” laughs Kim. “The characters clearly liked each other so I figured we should probably do it properly,” Lynn adds.Later that evening, there was a party and the pair got chatting. They snuck into the village hall kitchen to share a bottle of wine. “I knew by the end of the evening that I was going to marry him,” says Kim. “I told my best friend and she said I was utterly mad. I had to take him to see her so she could make sure he was good enough.” Luckily, Lynn aced the interview.The couple took things slowly over Christmas and began dating properly in the new year. By March 2000, Lynn had moved into Kim’s house, where she lived with her five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. “They adored each other from the start. On one of the first nights he put her to bed, I remember them getting out her drum kit. I had to laugh,” Kim says.They married in September that year on Iona, a remote island in Scotland. “Lynn suggested it and I thought: ‘Why not?’ It was organised over the phone.” They didn’t tell anyone about the wedding, but persuaded the local vicar and his daughter to travel up to perform the ceremony. “We asked the landlady and landlord of the bed and breakfast we stayed at to be our witnesses. It was just us, them and a tourist who was visiting the church at the time,” says Lynn.They took pictures on the beach before heading out for a meal together. “We wanted a small private wedding and Iona is an incredibly spiritual place,” says Lynn. Kim trusted his judgment. “I’d never been on any adventures before we met and now we’ve had so many.”The couple say they complement each other well. “I’m a country mouse and he’s a town mouse,” Kim says. “I’ve introduced him to all the community activities he came looking for, and he holds my hand when we go to the city.”Over the years, they have been involved in many small productions, from village plays to special events like the local asparagus festival. Although they don’t perform together as much now, they still share a love for drama. “We go out to different historical sites and always end up raiding the dressing-up box,” says Kim. “We just enjoy taking silly pictures and having fun together.” They also try to travel to Iona every year for their anniversary.Lynn supported her recent career change, and Kim now works for a mental health crisis line. “He makes me laugh all the time,” says Kim. “And I’ve learnt more from him than I ever did at school. He’s pushed me to be better and I owe him a lot.” Lynn describes his wife as the most thoughtful person he has ever met. “She’s the only thing that keeps me sane. We don’t have to do anything to be happy together.”• Want to share your story?

Here, his students remember a man who lived inside musicThe Indian classical vocalist Pandit Jasraj has died at the age of 90, a man described by one of his senior disciples, Sanjeev Abhyankar, as “an incomparable genius, the kind born once in a century”.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was among those paying tribute to this hero of his country’s music, saying his death leaves “a deep void in the Indian cultural sphere”. Known for his unique voice which had both depth and softness, Pandit Jasraj was one of a handful of remaining old school musical giants of the Indian classical world, alongside artists like Bhimsen Joshi and Kishori Amonkar. Incredibly, he was performing and teaching online until the end with a remarkably robust, age-defying voice. In the words of Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman, “India has lost one of its finest stars.”Jasraj was a pioneering artist well known for his egalitarian approach. He incorporated Indian devotional music such as haveli sangeet and bhajans (devotional songshymns) into a classical milieu, transforming them into serious pieces people loved his devotional music and he maintained mass appeal in a style where bhava (emotion) and devotion were paramount, yet all the while based on a very serious classical foundation.Born in the northern Indian state of Haryana in 1930 into a musical family, Pandit Jasraj began learning tabla at a very early age from his elder brother Pandit Pratap Narayan, and later moved on to vocal music under another older brother, Pandit Maniram. He learned from various musicians in the Mewati and Agra gharanas (schools of music), becoming a regular radio performer and moving to Calcutta in 1947 – a hub of immense artistic activity for musicians at that time.He settled in Mumbai in 1963, and continued on for the next 50-plus years to a prolific international performing, recording and teaching career. He established schools in India, the United States and Canada Modi’s tribute added that “not only were his renditions outstanding, he also made a mark as an exceptional mentor to several other vocalists”. Over time he evolved the Mewati gharana to its greatest heights of ornamentation and sophistication, and proved himself to be a gifted composer, adding many compositions to the Mewati canon.Kala Ramnath, violinist and senior student, described Pandit Jasraj as “the father I did not have while growing up, the best guru one could have had – and a very generous person in everything he did. Music is so abstract that one cannot visualise the placement of notes, but he made me visualise them in my mind. The microtones in every melody … I have travelled with him far and wide and he always appreciated not only me, but many upcoming musicians who had something to offer in their art. It was always instant appreciation, he never kept anything to himself. He just breathed music all the time – teaching us while at the dining table during lunch, during travel … always in music.”Experiencing Jasraj’s performance was to see a force of nature in action. His concerts were awe inspiring in terms of his dynamic, creative style and classical technique. Some of his famous songs such as Mero Allah and Om Namo Bhagavate showed how he had the ability to begin with the gentlest of introductions, which then developed via a series of progressively elaborate stages to reach a dizzying climax of sheer rhythmic ecstasy. There was always a mesmerising, uplifting and joyous quality present in his repertoire.His path-breaking style, the merging of such classical vocal prowess to render material which had mass appeal, was utterly unique. Ornamentation like meend (sliding from one note to the next), kan swar (the use of grace notes), gamak (oscillation between notes), murkhi (a short cluster of notes) and laykari (rhythmic work), were all facets of the traditional classical way of singing which he emphasised in the Mewati style.As Abhyankar explained, his guru’s vast range of at least three octaves and such a versatile sound was without limitation since he exploited all three ranges freely – which made him a complete musician. In the lower octave, “he created sound as if somebody was ing deep into the ocean. When vocalising the middle octave, he gave a completely different magical and meditative grip. And when he travelled to the higher octave, it was like his voice was eager to meet inity.”The man behind the music was a generous, giving person, full of life, who brought people together, and who would happily take on deserving students. Abhyankar recalled his nickname for his guru was “the magnet” because once he brought someone into his orbit, he would keep them close, training and looking after them for years, sometimes decades.He was a people person and a connector who built up a huge extra family of friends, well-wishers, students and contacts. Always active, always moving and in touch. Ramnath remembered her guru fondly as kind and caring to all his students, “treating us like his family, taking care of us when we stayed with him to learn music, not charging us a single penny for giving us the knowledge that he gave so generously. He has taken us to watch movies, to restaurants – lovely memories ... It is really hard to accept that I won’t be able to see him any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c9a4b834fb5fe5fdb43be06760c38747b247027/0_180_5434_3261/master/5434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f41cb1a62a7533d77e29b44ec15023","title":"can kamala harris help joe biden win the us presidency podcast","story":"Kamala Harris is the first Indian American and the first black woman to run for US vice-president on a major party ticket.

They are now considering applying to court for legal papers to be released and could invoke a clause in the Scotland Act 1998 which allows Holyrood to compel the disclosure of government documents and to compel witnesses to appear.The committee inquiry will start hearing oral evidence on Tuesday by calling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, who oversaw a botched internal inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond launched in early 2018. Salmond denied the allegations.Salmond sued the government in August 2018, accusing it of breaching natural justice by failing to allow him a proper chance to defend himself. He won the case after government lawyers admitted in court in January 2019 the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign.Evans will give evidence under oath, and has insisted on bringing with her the Scottish government’s most senior solicitor. Salmond, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the Scottish National party, are due to appear before the committee later this year.The committee will also investigate Salmond’s allegations that Sturgeon’s close aides and civil servants orchestrated a witch-hunt against him – a charge Sturgeon has rejected.Those allegations intensified during Salmond’s subsequent court appearance on 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, although the Holyrood inquiry will avoid any discussion of those allegations or the evidence heard during the trial.Salmond was acquitted on all charges by a high court jury after his lawyer alleged there had been a conspiracy involving some of the 10 women involved in the case, senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP.In a letter published on the eve of the Evans hearing on Tuesday, Swinney rejected the committee’s repeated demands for release of legal papers and internal reports on the original harassment inquiry, claiming the documents were legally privileged.Swinney added that ministers could not release reports or notes from civil servants who investigated the first two complaints against Salmond. Ministers would, however, support an application to the court to release its submissions to the judicial review taken by Salmond in 2018.Swinney and Evans also insist civil servants cannot be expected or compelled to offer opinions on what happened, claiming that would breach the civil service code. MSPs on the committee believe that is an attempt to muzzle officials, and have warned Evans and Swinney they will use their parliamentary powers to ensure transparency.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, and a committee member, said: “It is so disappointing that the Scottish government, having promised cooperation and transparency at the start of this process, now appears to be turning its back on that pledge.”Alex Cole-Hamilton, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, added: “This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish government deeply embarrassed.“The committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest. That evasiveness does not serve the people of Scotland well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2e2c500a3365dc5a77244affd2ca2d39cf3457/0_71_3278_1967/master/3278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=447c97adb09611b4f496c8424c365a09","title":"andy burnham were a clear voice telling the machine what its doing wrong covid 19 manchester","story":"Greater Manchester’s mayor learned lessons from swine flu and has lost no time exposing flaws in Downing Street’s responseEleven years ago, Andy Burnham stood up in the house of commons and delivered a sombre statement about a pandemic sweeping the nation. Twenty-nine people in the UK had died from swine flu and the then-health secretary had been warned that 65,000 lives could be lost.Experts from Imperial College in London – including one Professor Neil Ferguson – were urging him to shut schools to slow transmission. Grim-faced, Burnham told MPs “the virus has now taken hold around the country, rather than in isolated pockets”. The government had ordered enough vaccine for everyone, he said, but it would be months before a mass immunisation programme would begin.Fast forward to August 2020 and Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, is sitting on a bench overlooking Pennington Flash, a water park built on an old colliery in what was until 2017 his Leigh constituency.Having been assured a photographer would not be in attendance, he is wearing navy Birkenstocks and jeans. Almost everyone recognises him from his 16 years as MP. “Hiya Andy!” beams a speedwalking lady “All right, mayor!” yells a topless man. Burnham’s children – aged 15, 18 and 20 – hate going to the supermarket with him, but he clearly loves the attention: “If you don’t like chatting to people, don’t become a politician.”The government announced last week that Greater Manchester would remain subject to enhanced lockdown restrictions for a third week, and Burnham is threatening to withdraw his support unless they compensate those who cannot work – either because they are told to by contact tracers or because their workplaces are shut.Much has changed since his ministerial days. Leigh has gone Tory for the first time in its 113-year history, lost in December to his successor, Jo Platt – “It’s a real lesson to everybody in life isn’t it? Nothing is a given and nothing lasts forever” – and Burnham is dealing with a second deadly virus outbreak in his 19-year career in frontline politics.It’s from this position – or more correctly, a makeshift study in his son’s old attic bedroom in the nearby village of Golborne – that Burnham has arguably shaped the government’s response to the pandemic more than anyone else in the Labour party.Though denied a place on the government’s emergency “Cobra” committee (unlike his London counterpart, Sadiq Khan) he has used a constant stream of media appearances, press conferences and dawn-till-dusk video calls to expose the literally fatal flaws in its centralised approach which for four key months deprived local experts of real-time infection data.Some might say he is better at calling for other people to do things than getting stuff done himself, but that could be the lack of hard power that comes with his £110,000-a-year job.“I like to think we are beginning to change politics,” Burnham says of himself and the other elected “metro” mayors, notably his friend Steve Rotheram in the Liverpool city region and Andy Street in the West Midlands – a Tory candidate who said last week he wished he could stand as an independent.“We’ve not changed the government machine yet. I think it went into default mode: ‘We are running everything. We will find a place for London on Cobra but not you.’ But I think what’s happened during this is that we have provided a clear and consistent voice back to that machine to tell them what they are doing wrong.”He began the Covid-19 pandemic warning Boris Johnson that his experience handling swine flu had shown him the importance of clear communication.On 15 March, infuriated that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had used a column in the Sunday  to announce that anyone with symptoms must isolate at home for seven days, he pushed for a daily press conference fronted by scientists and health experts. The following day Johnson held the government’s first daily televised briefing.Three weeks later, Hancock was left helping to steer the ship when Johnson was in intensive care with Covid. Burnham knew better than most how hard it must have been. “I don’t envy anyone in government dealing with this situation because I had a minor version of it with swine flu – a smaller health crisis which didn’t have the economic crisis along with it. I know how hard that was … so there’s no point me making a tribal point about it,” he says. Fewer than 400 people died from swine flu in the UK in 2009, compared with more than 41,000 Covid-related deaths in England alone.“Where I am less forgiving is having done things wrong, they have carried on doing things wrong – the way they have announced things, with no consultation, no explanation, late at night constantly putting out very centralised contracts which don’t really work on the ground.”Yet Burnham admits he would happily swap places with Johnson, himself a former mayor: “There’s no point me saying I wouldn’t because I have tried to lead the Labour party in the past and therefore I wanted to be prime minister. What I have changed my mind on is the way power needs to be distributed around the country. The model of government doesn’t work … I think we need a massive reorganisation of the British state.”Until now, he has supported the extra lockdown measures in Greater Manchester and advocated for the entire region of 2.8 million people to be treated as one. But perhaps not for much longer. He is worried about the small print in the government’s latest announcement, which says: “Where possible the government will remove inidual areas from these measures while maintaining or even strengthening measures in others as necessary.”The prospect of a sudden “proper” lockdown – closing shops and businesses with no notice – is a worry, he says: “I said I was nervous about it at the start and I am coming back to a big nervousness about local lockdowns. I am going to be seeking a very frank exchange with the government about it. Not an argument. But it can’t be done too easily.”The government can’t suddenly tighten restrictions without a package of compensatory measures for workers, insists Burnham: “How can I justify it to people when things like support for people to self isolate hasn’t been sorted? You can only try the most restrictive measures if you have tried everything else… We have hit a point now where local lockdowns cannot be the default thing that they slap on places where they get over a certain threshold – especially as they have refused to identify the threshold.”Having been health secretary, he knows that the clock is ticking for the government to get a grip of the virus: “I think the worst is yet to come, I’m afraid. I know that’s not a cheering message, but schools returning – not that it’s a bad thing, I think it’s really important – poses a whole new level of challenge. Colleges and universities returning. Flu season arriving… No vaccine.”Burnham believes England came out of lockdown prematurely, saying the government should have ensured an effective test-and-trace system was up and running first. He says he has hardly left the house since it began, apart from what he calls his “state-sanctioned” 5km daily run, two trips to the pub and, from the look of his toenails, certainly no outings for a pedicure.He has been to just one restaurant, last Wednesday, to calm his 18-year-old’s nerves ahead of her A-level results. He refused to take advantage of the government’s Eat Out to Help Out discount – “I can show you the receipt if you don’t believe me” – believing it to be the wrong way to help the economy.“Who benefits? The discounting benefits people who might have gone anyway. It doesn’t necessarily end up in the pockets of the staff. The business maybe gets some benefit. There would have been better ways of helping the industry and I just found it amazing that they could find that level of funds when you are not helping people isolate if they are ill or asked to do so. It’s a question of priorities, isn’t it?”In an alternative universe, Burnham would probably have won his second mayoral election in May. Despite the Conservatives gaining a third of Greater Manchester’s 27 seats in the general election, the party failed to find a high-profile candidate to oust him as mayor, fielding a local councillor to nibble at his 230,00 majority.It was only when the mayoral elections were cancelled, on 13 March, that Burnham admits he understood the gravity of the situation. He will stand again next year, pandemic permitting. Some of his campaign pledges will have to be rethought – public transport was to have been his first priority. But Covid has sharpened others, such as the move towards a carbon-free future by 2038.“I think a legacy of Covid will be the acceleration towards a zero-carbon economy. It’s got to, hasn’t it? Partly a result of living differently, but also the economic imperative,” he says. “I look back at that world before lockdown it was a very different world and it’s a world that isn’t coming back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea92443c12df133d6fb1c70ada598f","title":"have you accessed a food bank in the uk for the first time coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the coronavirus pandemicAccording to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July, millions of people went hungry or relied on food bankds during the first few weeks of lockdown.We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the pandemic.How have you been coping and what was your experience like?

About a quarter of one percent of the 2,392 Tests to have been played have had a four-wicket over, falling to only a tenth of a percent of the 912 Tests played since the turn of this century. Weirdly, three of those six four-wicket overs were bowled at Headingley, where Test bowlers are more than 15 times more likely to take four wickets in an over than anywhere else.This Tuesday marks the 20th anniversary of the last time it happened, at Headingley or anywhere else. Andy Caddick was the bowler, a player who, just a few months from his 32nd birthday, was in the best form of his international life. Given his debut in 1993 under the captaincy of Graham Gooch, Caddick had been in and out of the side under his successor, Michael Atherton, and entirely out of the side under Alec Stewart, but his international fortunes were transformed by the near-simultaneous arrivals of Nasser Hussain as captain, Duncan Fletcher as coach, and central contracts.“You’d come into the team, and if you didn’t perform you were out again,” recalls Caddick, who now runs a company that sells aircraft, of life before central contracts. “Selectors at the time weren’t thinking of longevity, they were thinking of results. You don’t get results without thinking of longevity, and without players understanding the game at that level. It tended to be that you played a game, if you didn’t play well you were discarded, and you came back when all the rest had been discarded. It was a difficult time because as players you couldn’t perform and relax. There was always pressure on you, from the opposition, from yourself because you knew your position was under pressure, and from the selectors.“Then contracts came in and you signed a contract for a year. That meant you became part of the England squad, therefore you were in the team. There would be rotation, but you were going to be involved. The contracts were massive. Suddenly you were able to relax, you knew the captain and coach were backing you and your teammates were backing you, and everyone could work together. After that we were all in it together. It became a much more relaxed atmosphere, and for the first time I just did what I did for Somerset – give me the ball and I’ll bowl. I just enjoyed bowling.”Caddick’s place in the side was at least temporarily settled the previous winter, when he took seven first-innings wickets in a drawn Test in Durban, and he had followed that up with a decisive contribution to England’s victory in the second Test against West Indies at Lord’s, when with England already one down in the series and trailing by 133 runs after the first innings the tourists were skittled for 54, Caddick taking five including the key wicket of Brian Lara.“You couldn’t dwell on names. At the end of the day it’s just a batter. You’ve got to conquer reputation,” says Caddick. “I bowled a lot at Lara, bloody good player. I played against some seriously good players and Brian I think was top of the lot. But whatever the names are on the sheet you have to deal with them. Duncan was very good at analysing the opposition and finding weaknesses, which is something we didn’t do a lot of prior to him coming on board. There was a lot of video analysis, trying to work out where to put fielders when batters come in. You’re just trying to find a weakness, and some players didn’t have many, and then hope the batsman has a bad day.”And so to Headingley, the fourth Test in the series with the teams level at 1-1 after a draw at Old Trafford. England were precisely 100 ahead after the first innings, but the game remained in the balance as West Indies came out for their second knock. Not, however, for long. Adrian Griffith was bowled by Darren Gough for a duck in the third over with the score on three, and Wavell Hinds followed next ball. A couple of overs later came the big one, Lara lbw to Gough for two, and West Indies were 11 for three. Gough also dismissed the other opener, Sherwin Campbell, in the 11th over, and at tea the score was 23 for four. Dominic Cork broke the biggest partnership of the innings, such as it was, between Jimmy Adams and Ramnaresh Sarwan, when Adams dragged on. Enter Caddick.“The problem was, I like bowling up a hill, whether it’s Lord’s or Headingley. With my action I don’t like running down the hill,” he says. “Running up the hill I could attack the crease, which is very difficult running down the hill. Goughie always ran down the hill at Lord’s and down the hill at Headingley, but for some reason that day he wanted to go up the hill, and he was taking wickets and didn’t want to stop. Finally I got a chance to run up the hill, and everything clicked.”Ridley Jacobs was trapped lbw off the first ball of the 23rd over, then Nixon McLean bowled off the third and Curtley Ambrose off the fourth. For the hat-trick ball England had five slips, two gulleys and a short leg, but Reon King survived. A no-ball later King, the only right-hander in the group, also lost his off stump.“What you try to do all the time as a bowler is do the basics right. I think too many bowlers these days try to bowl 15 different deliveries I was always trying to bowl the same ball every time – hit the top of off. Whether it’s over the course of a spell or over a number of spells, you try to achieve the same thing. That day the conditions were perfect, the ball was swinging, and you just had to let the ball do the work. It really helps a swing bowler to bowl at left-handers – the wicket is always in play, lbw is always in play, so that was always going to help. In that over it just clicked.”Courtney Walsh was the last to fall, also bowled by Caddick, and the bowler finished with figures of five wickets for 14 off 11.2 overs. West Indies were bowled out for 61, and victory at the Oval in the final Test saw England seal the series. “As far as I was concerned Lord’s was key,” he says. “We were looking down the barrel of a series defeat there and it turned the game around. I think it was more important than Headingley in the context of changing the series.” When it came to making history, however, Caddick, like two of the other members of the select club he joined that afternoon in 2000, had to leave it until Leeds.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Maybe this is just the imagination playing trick shots but for a snooker player widely acclaimed as the greatest of all time, Ronnie O’Sullivan does seem to miscue quite a lot? Certainly more than you’d expect from your average preternatural, life-affirming, once-in-a-generation talent.There was one against Mark Williams at the 2016 Masters that cost him the frame. One against Ali Carter at the Crucible in 2018 that cost him the match. In fact, there are compilations on YouTube: the horrible scrape of the cue, the ball skewing through the air, the horrified gasps of shock from the crowd.And so it was again, against Kyren Wilson on Sunday night: a poor one-sided final about to be crowned with a glorious century break, if only O’Sullivan could pot a tricky last black. “Clunk.” An audience groan. For O’Sullivan, simply a scowl of grim, placid acceptance. As if this had been coming all along. As if he knew it would end like this. “If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride, and hug it in mine arms! Now, to collect my sixth world championship and a cheque for £500,000.”Maybe you found this quite a dissonant ending. To me, it was perfect. It was pure Ronnie: beauty tarnished by ugliness, ugliness uplifted by triumph, triumph pursued by fatalism and inevitable talk of retirement. This is why the frequent comparisons with Lionel Messi or Roger Federer, with Picasso or Mozart, have never quite seemed to capture the essence of him. Or why, if he is indeed such an unimpeachable talent, it has taken him seven years to regain the world title.It’s not just about the beauty, or the perfection. It’s not just those irresistible passages of play when he makes the game look so easy he may as well have downloaded it. It’s also the darkness and the doubt, the wandering thoughts, the duelling contradictions, the quiet madness bubbling beneath the surface, the sheer fragility of what you’re seeing. Or, put more simply: you can’t truly appreciate an O’Sullivan break without simultaneously confronting the possibility that at any moment, and for no reason at all, he might miss.Often you will find these contradictions rather glibly expressed as O’Sullivan’s “demons”, a term that only really serves to underline the inadequacy of sport’s mental health vocabulary. As O’Sullivan explains so well in his book Running, the relationship between his profession and his state of mind is frequently far less operatic and far more complex.Sometimes it manifests itself in an overactive imagination, other times in a lapse of concentration. Sometimes it leads him into addiction, other times into ennui, other times – as when he disdainfully tried to smash his way out of a snooker against Mark Selby in the semi-final – into a sort of wilful self-sabotage.“Am I prepared to give blood, sweat and tears?” he said in an interview before the tournament. “No. Would everybody else like to see me give blood, sweat and tears? Probably yes.”For us as onlookers, there is a faintly problematic ring to all this. After all, the greatest part of sport is the part you don’t understand, and O’Sullivan’s thrilling inconsistency and caprice are part of what makes him so compelling to watch. But to what extent is it legitimate to enjoy the spectacle of someone teetering on the precipice? To what extent does O’Sullivan owe us his talent? To what extent is he required to keep practising for hours in dimly lit rooms for our entertainment?There isn’t a right or a wrong answer to this, by the way: it’s simply an acknowledgement that with certain athletes – Nick Kyrgios and Tyson Fury also spring to mind – what is in their best interests and what is in ours are not always in perfect alignment.This is a problem for snooker too, which has long been bracing itself for the day when O’Sullivan finally takes his leave. In a way, snooker has been a victim of its own inexorable rise in standards. A sport in which any of the top 16 can now punish the slightest safety error is one that will inevitably tend to reward the steady percentage players: your Selbys, your Wilsons, your Anthony McGills. Even Judd Trump has to become a wiser, less interesting player to reach the game’s summit.The truth is that in order to thrive as a flawed maverick in the modern game, you need to be at least as talented as O’Sullivan. And as O’Sullivan so tartly pointed out earlier in the tournament, there are few signs that anyone else currently comes close.In the meantime, we still have Ronnie. And for all the usual wild extrapolations – now for Hendry’s record! Sports Personality of the Year! a knighthood! – perhaps the least we owe a man who has provided us with so much pleasure over the years is to accept him on his own terms. He is 44 now, and by all accounts as happy as he’s ever been, with a erse range of interests and a healthier outlook on life.“Everything in moderation” is one of his mottos, from food to exercise to rest to snooker and in that simple phrase lies the secret of his unlikely contentment. Perhaps on reflection, O’Sullivan’s greatest triumph was to conquer the ledger of his own happiness. Perhaps the toughest opponent he ever had to crack was himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86554d6cf8a2c2f8805c39a6900d87f14963af50/0_65_2360_1415/master/2360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41562470af4797bf794717536e0d720e","title":"dylan hartley england tales rugby union no place to hide","story":"Former England captain’s enlightening autobiography could loosen a few tongues among his less forthright successorsIt was always likely that Dylan Hartley’s soon-to-be published autobiography would cause a ripple or two. Few rugby players have managed to ide opinion so reliably or reinvent themselves so successfully dull anonymity has rarely been the former England captain’s speciality. The initial passages to emerge from his book, The Hurt, are both forthright and striking.Perhaps most significant of all, however, is the harsh light Hartley shines on rugby itself. Not since Jonny Wilkinson’s slightly disturbing autobiography has a high-profile England player made his day job sound more wince-inducing. “My generation of players have been crash dummies for a sport in transition from semi-professionalism,” he writes, suggesting the game’s money men treat those who take the field like “human widgets” and revealing that he discouraged his family from visiting the team hotel on days off “because it would have felt like a prison visit”.There are mountaineering books on conquering Everest that paint a softer picture than Hartley’s description of the England camp under the relentless Eddie Jones. Nothing truly worth achieving is ever easy, clearly, but the Rugby Football Union cannot be entirely sanguine when a hard-nosed senior player says there were times “when playing for England felt a bit like taking part in one of those brutal dance marathons in the Great Depression of the 1920s, where penniless couples kept going until they collapsed”.Touching the void, and all that. As with his lineout throwing in the latter half of his career, the former Northampton and England hooker has taken aim at some tricky targets and hit a good number of them. It will be interesting to see if Jones’s employer is brave enough to demand any adjustments for the sake of those who remain. Even rugby’s hardest nuts have soft centres, mentally if not physically.Hartley, to be absolutely clear, rates Jones as the best coach he played under. But can a sport whose smashed-up participants struggle to wipe their own backsides the day after games and gobble painkillers like Smarties – Hartley’s words – be considered entirely healthy? Every leading sportsperson requires crazy levels of commitment these days the term player welfare increasingly feels like an oxymoron for all those at rugby’s coal face.On the face of it, Hartley is one of the lucky ones: he led England for a lengthy period, reaped the financial benefits that came with it and has a young family he adores. There are umpteen players out there who would settle for a fraction of that return. But just because Hartley was personally able to absorb such fearsome levels of punishment, it should not obscure the wider price today’s top players risk having to pay. If any line in Hartley’s book chills the blood it is the 34-year-old’s admission that, following multiple concussions, he gets dizzy easily and sometimes gets his words muddled.No wonder his wife, Jo, says she is relieved he has now retired. Where once there would have been little doubt as to whether boxing or rugby union was the more punishing pro sport, now it feels a much-closer-run thing. The difference is that top boxers are paid millions rugby players are seeing their wages drop at a time when their trade has never felt more consistently brutal.It is another reason why Hartley’s views on how players might be better protected in future should carry hefty weight. He advocates central contracts, a six-month season and fewer league games, with bone-on-bone contact training restricted to pre-season alone. This, remember, is someone who played 96 Tests in the front row and served 60 weeks in suspensions. Even the toughest, most grizzled of hombres are saying enough is enough.There is an argument that, for maximum effect, Hartley should have expressed a few more of these pithy opinions while he was still wearing the England captain’s armband. Not easy, clearly, and potentially career-shortening, but The Hurt underlines what many of us who sit through endlessly-beige press conferences with muzzled, overly media-managed players have been saying for years. If they told it like it is more often, players might find a few more influential people will have no choice but to listen.Congratulations to Dylan, either way, for speaking out now. It would not surprise me if a fair amount of the love he occasionally forfeited during his career comes flooding back when people realise he is smarter and funnier in real life than they had appreciated. Yes, Hartley’s tale is a cautionary one in some respects but his testimony might just prove to be the catalyst that frees others up to make a positive difference. Here’s hoping it allows the next generation of international forwards to wipe their own backsides unaided in future.It is a while since England were so spoilt for choice at fly-half. It is way too soon, clearly, to pension off Owen Farrell or George Ford – aged 28 and 27 respectively – but Exeter’s Joe Simmonds, Harlequins’ Marcus Smith and Wasps’ Jacob Umaga are all knocking enthusiastically on Eddie Jones’s door. The trio all have something about them and would interest any of the home nations if you were placing a bet on which of them will go on to win the most Test caps you might be tempted to say Smith, a long-time Jones favourite, but it is no coincidence that Simmonds and Umaga are playing for teams in the Premiership top four. All three are good enough to be around for a while.The suspended Guinness Pro 14 season is due to restart this weekend, albeit minus the cross-border element of the league, with the semi-finals and final scheduled to follow next month. The provincial ‘derbies’ will be useful for national coaches as they seek to finalise their autumn plans but will also be monitored closely by European Professional Club Rugby officials, still desperate for their own tournament to resume in mid-September. Amid all the excitement surrounding the return of live rugby in Britain and Ireland, a potential sudden spike in Covid-19 infections in the next fortnight would be an absolute nightmare for the authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee3a9b3c02ccf9143d51994c76732dc0720c877a/0_188_3640_2185/master/3640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f742d2c9e3a86b2652edaebbadd0e119","title":"county cricket surrey v hampshire yorkshire v derbyshire and more live","story":"Hove: Sussex 194 and 120-7 v Essex 140Canterbury: Middlesex 269 and 34-0 v Kent 191Headingley: Yorks 400-6 v Derbyshire 198-6 Inspection at 1.30pmTrent Bridge: Notts 472 all out v Lancs 173 and 2-0.

Now, Doctor Who is to become an ambitious immersive theatre experience, too.The new incarnation for the BBC’s much-loved sci-fi series comes from the team behind The Great Gatsby, an adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald’s jazz age novel that has become the UK’s longest-running immersive show.Doctor Who: Time Fracture will open in February at Immersive | LDN, a former military drill hall in Mayfair, central London. The show is set, initially, in the immediate local area during the blitz. When a weapon of unknown origin destroys a small corner of Mayfair, a rift in space and time is opened up. The ensuing adventure takes place across “amazingly realised worlds” and promises Daleks, Cybermen and a character from Time Lord Victorious, BBC Studios’ multi-platform Doctor Who story. All it asks of the audience, according to the show’s publicity material, is “to step up and be the hero” – and to save an imperilled planet from menacing monsters.Writer Daniel Dingsdale says he has drawn on the TV show’s rich legacy to create a production that he hopes will entertain fans who have “immersed themselves in the show’s universe for years” as well as those audience members who may “walk in from the street having never seen an episode”. The Immersive Everywhere production is directed by Tom Maller, who has worked on several Secret Cinema projects, and has a production design by Rebecca Brower.After a two-week delay, the government gave the green light last week to socially distanced indoor theatre productions in England (stage four of culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s roadmap to reopening venues). Several indoor shows have already been announced for later this year including a new version of Immersive Everywhere’s production of The Great Gatsby, set to reopen in October at the same London venue as the Doctor Who experience. The new Gatsby show replaces the hedonistic throng of the original production, which featured a 250-strong group charleston, with a socially distanced masquerade ball. Actors and audiences will wear face coverings and there will be a vastly reduced capacity at the event. The Great Gatsby has a venue-wide sterilisation programme and hand sanitisation stations throughout the building. Staff and audiences are required to have a temperature check on entry. Similar measures will be in place at the Doctor Who show.Louis Hartshorn, joint CEO of Immersive Everywhere, said: “Based on everything we know now, we are confident that Doctor Who: Time Fracture will be able to go ahead as planned in early 2021. We will be taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our audiences and full creative team.” Tickets for Doctor Who: Time Fracture go on sale on 20 August. Immersive Everywhere has a no-questions-asked exchange policy for customers who are no longer able to attend. There will be a free preview performance of the production as a thank you to care workers at the front line of the pandemic.In the early days of the UK lockdown, Jodie Whittaker appeared as the Doctor in a short Doctor Who “emergency transmission” video. “Darkness never prevails,” she said, urging worried viewers to be kind and look out for each other. “Remember: you will get through this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b49539e1f2ccfd4d5e2f4f4f61463043754ec1/0_575_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1fe96c45ccce5f23691eaf9e5b2abd","title":"maureen lipman interview rose martin sherman","story":"Trans actors, Palestine, Tony Blair, typecasting, socialists with multiple houses … as she stars in Rose, a play that covers everything from the Holocaust to the six-day war, the actor lets ripI met Maureen Lipman in the most old-fashioned way, over the telephone, to talk about her new role. She’s starring in Martin Sherman’s Rose, which will be available for three nights only – to replicate the sense of theatrical occasion – but online, rather than live. “It’s a story of one woman’s recollection, from the Holocaust to the six-day war, and slightly beyond, and how she comes to make a stand herself, rather than just survive. The play begins and ends with her making a statement about humanity, rather than just on being Jewish or a gentile.”She’s thrilled about the role – originally made famous by Olympia Dukakis – and makes the point that, by the time you hit 74, parts don’t just end up in your lap. She’s also in Coronation Street, of course, and describes fitting the two filming schedules in with the unsociable hours and the midnight taxis of the actor in high demand. She’s so positive about Sherman’s work, however – “it’s as sensitive, clever, deep and profound a piece as I’ve read” – that you can sense a “but …” coming, and there is one. “I’d done Martin’s other play, Messiah” – this was 1982 – “and I had an unfortunate experience: somebody in Hampstead stood up and screamed at me. It rattled me. I’ve always been a very confident actress and I never really questioned my confidence on stage, but it did unsettle me as a person. And then, of course, the BT adverts happened around the same time, and it suddenly turned me from a jobbing actress to a Jewish actress.”That ad had a mysteriously huge impact. Lipman was Beattie, the witty, caustic Jewish grandmother (at one point her son, for reasons I can neither recall nor guess at, refers to her breasts, and she says: “Huh, they moved south about the same time you did”). It was so talked-about that it did rather eclipse her earlier reputation: as a stage talent, a member of both the National Theatre Company and the RSC, Lamda-trained, having grown up in Hull with a tailor father and a fiercely encouraging mother. She was a sitcom favourite in the 70s, early in the genre, and always memorable even in small roles, such as Sylvie in Up the Junction.Lipman isn’t complaining about being typecast – she’s sprightly and pragmatic on that: “You’re bloody glad to have a good part. Because I’m not going to be in Downton Abbey, am I?” It’s a much more complicated point she’s making, which starts with pigeonholes. “In the last few years, we’re all in little boxes, aren’t we? You have to play what you are. The whole purpose of acting is to play what you’re not.” This lands us, arse over tit, if you’ll forgive the phrase (this whole conversation has brought the 80s rushing back), in the trans debate. “They’re saying, now, nobody can play a person who’s trans unless they are. I’m thinking of Scarlett Johansson, she turned down a trans role because she said it wasn’t fair to take it. And that’s a good choice.“But we’re in a different timeline, because anybody can play Shylock, and they do. Anybody can play a survivor, and they do.” For all that Lipman is famously outspoken, I can’t work out what she really thinks. Should anybody be allowed to play Shylock? Did Scarlett Johansson make a good choice? “I am all for people fighting for their rights. Of course. But if somebody’s playing a Holocaust survivor, and I’m looking at them on the television and know that they’re not and never have been Jewish, have I got the same right to say, ‘They shouldn’t play that because they’re not?’”To return to the role of Rose, and Lipman’s audience encounter in Messiah, I wonder whether there isn’t another element to her trepidation about taking on another Sherman play – whether creatively delving into a collective trauma is actually quite traumatic to do. “The early Sherman play was 17th century, so that was a different trauma, they were fleeing a pogrom. But yes, collective trauma is something I’m very aware of. I’m very aware, particularly in my business, of the attitude towards the only Jewish state in the world.”What a segue: Maureen Lipman is famous for her defence of Israel. She actually reprised Beattie for a video attacking Jeremy Corbyn at the last election, but her falling out with the Labour party went back to the leader before – she was furious with Ed Miliband for supporting a House of Commons motion to recognise Palestine as a state.While she remains absolutely caustic about a lot of Labour and its works, she admits quite wryly what her relationship was to this party she has so often renounced. “I was a Labour luvvie, with Blair. I wasn’t really a party member.” She talks about all Blair had to deal with, from foot and mouth disease to the death of Princess Diana, to that other thing to do with cows (mad cow disease, we both realise at once), “and he did it with grace, and style, and he did it with gravitas and statesmanship. You had exactly the same situation with him and Campbell as you did with Boris and Cummings. People in power need advisers.”Does this mean she supports Boris Johnson? It seems like quite a journey from a Labour-ish luvvie to that, and she is laughingly affronted. “I’d have to be stark raving mad to be a supporter of Boris Johnson. And I’m not. I don’t envy him what he wished for, because he got it.”Yet in any conversation about politics, she remains principally vigilant about Israel even when it’s miles from the topic, we somehow end up back there. So we jump from Johnson and what a mess he makes, back to the Labour party and whether or not antisemitism has gone away (“you can see it hasn’t”) and suddenly we’re at the explosion in Beirut, which had happened that day. “As soon as Lebanon happened, I can imagine the types that were ready to say, ‘Israel’s on the border, did they, would they, could they?’ I’m very grateful that Hezbollah said they did it.”Wait, what? It was an accident resulting from political fecklessness, Hezbollah isn’t even the largest party in the Lebanese parliament, and definitely nobody said they did it. She makes a noise as though we’ll just agree to differ.Lipman’s hardline stance on Israel, she suggests, means that she won’t work with certain actors who support the Palestinian cause. “I won’t be going on tour with The Killing of Sister George with Maxine Peake and Miriam Margolyes, put it that way.”Peake, sure, would be an impossible acquaintance, after her recent comments – which she retracted – were deemed anti-Israel enough to get  Rebecca Long-Bailey kicked off the Labour front bench for retweeting her. But Margolyes, surely, is different. Yes, she vocally supports Palestine, but they’re two character actresses of the same generation (Margolyes is five years older) – they must have gone up for the same parts, been to the same parties for decades there must be times when they meet and don’t talk about Israel?“We’ve seen each other at the odd funeral,” she concedes. “I don’t wish her ill. And she’s a very successful leftwing socialist with several houses. Take my point. Need I say more.” Well, not unless you want to … “Most of the stuff that I say is not that dissimilar to her. We’re opinionated women, we’ve got a platform, we tend to spew out the first thing that comes into our fevered little brains. It’s just that, unfortunately, I’m right.”Give or take a quick drive-by attack on John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, this has a mellowing effect on the conversation, and she reverts to the views of the Blair-era luvvie – worried about the future of theatre (“if the rats are eating the velvet, I’m going to be really sad”), mindful of the other side of the coin (“I do think the West End had become moribund. Shows were running for too long and they were tired”), relaxed and self-aware: “A lot of us, it’s very hard to distinguish between wanting a job and wanting to show off. I don’t know the difference, I never have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a49365584816a0302ff80beecc57b200b126cc59/204_195_4854_2913/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce5c7eb204ab37c56429aef5fc9ebc5","title":"overall its like the most chaotic pinterest board made real birch hertfordshire review","story":"Birch is the latest ‘concept’ hotel to chase the Instagram generation, but haphazard design and pricey wellness and creative activities leave little room for relaxation Arriving at Birch, you would be forgiven for thinking you were headed to a service station. Close enough to the M25 that the constant thrum of cars provides a blanket backdrop of noise, the imposing Georgian mansion at the end of a dirt track turn-off comes as a surprise. There are no fruit machines or KFC here.A longstanding hotel and conference centre near Cheshunt, the imposing 22-hectare, Grade II-listed property has been the subject of a radical makeover by Chris Penn, former managing director of US brand Ace Hotels. The Birch ethos, Penn told me, is to “give a shit”, to be “accessible,” to be “a festival at a hotel” or perhaps not even be a hotel at all. Rather, a space for “escape artists” – those wishing to get away from the relentless pace of London, a 30-minute train ride away to the south.What do these awkward aphorisms mean outside of investor pitch meetings? At first glance, it means an effective marketing strategy – one that has seen Birch fully booked for every weekend in August and filled with 4x4-driving families, Lululemon-legged groups of friends and young couples theatrically photographing each other in the hotel’s many spaces. These spaces include an impressive Wellness Centre, refurbished from a previous incarnation as a Tesco training centre, a music room complete with karaoke machine, two bars, two restaurants, a bakery and an open-plan social space called The Hub, complete with off-shooting rooms for co-working.There is a lot to take in at Birch. To begin with, the design is haphazard and overwhelming. Vast, newly painted ultramarine walls give way to exposed plasterwork before labyrinthine corridors lead to Matisse-style murals, beautiful original mosaic flooring, Ercol-style furniture and more exposed pipework and air ducts than you’d see at a Costco.In the 140 rooms (doubles, twins and family rooms with additional bunks) there are no desks and no TVs, just inordinately comfortable beds, obscure sculptural hanging racks, bunches of dried flowers and – in my case – a dingy bathroom repainted bubblegum pink. There are well-thought-out moments, such as the inidual ceramic keyrings that match the room numbers, or the handcrafted beer and wine taps, but overall it is like the most chaotic Pinterest board made real a hasty DIY SOS makeover meets industrial-chic Hackney cafe.And it is not just the design that perplexes. A core function of Birch is to offer a curated “cultural programme”. This means that during your stay you can take part in classes ranging from gong baths to sourdough and soda breadmaking, glassblowing workshops and outdoor yoga (hand sanitiser and posters asking people to keep distanced are dotted about). These classes come at a cost, ranging from £20 for an hour of soda-bread kneading to £150 for a pair to go glassblowing, and there is so much on offer, each experience inevitably feels underwhelming. For instance, my gong bath was interrupted by the sounds of cars wheeling through crunching gravel outside, a snoring attendee and the unceremonious checking of payments at the beginning. After an hour, I left feeling as unrelaxed as ever.Birch sits among the trend hotels aiming to cater to young people more likely to choose an Airbnb for a hyperlocal, informal stay than the commercial rigidity of an establishment. It is a concept that has gained traction in recent years, prompting multinationals such as Hilton and Accor to launch new, less-staid brands, as well as spawning new contenders in the likes of Curtain, a hotel and members’ club in Shoreditch, and apart-hotel groups like Locke Living, with their focus on co-working spaces, wellness programmes and “creative” events. Birch muddies this easygoing ethos by also being a members’ club. Anyone can become a member for £100 a month, as well as £150 joining fee, and that allows unfettered access to classes and discount room rates, which start at £120 a night.Penn may want the Birch ethos to be one of accessibility and inclusivity, with guests feeling empowered to try new experiences at will, but money is of course everything. And everything at Birch falls into the “London prices” category: £4 for a small bottle of lemonade, £10 for a mini ingot of goat’s cheese and crackers, £10 for a sandwich. The water, though, is free.There is one place where Birch makes sense. That is at chef Robin Gill’s Zebra Riding Club restaurant. In the manor’s old stables, an open-plan kitchen produces remarkably good food at £48 for its tasting menu. The ethos is farm-to-table and dishes include home-cured bresaola with pickled green tomato and perfect sourdough from the onsite bakery, firm yet flaky monkfish steaks, and a mouth-wateringly umami broth with eggs from rescued battery Birch hens. Perhaps this restaurant should be made more central to the Birch experience, rather than another adjunct to try out.Birch is at pains to tell you it is not just a hotel – it is a wellness space, an oasis of respite from London located close enough to London and filled with enough people from London to make you feel like you’re still in London, while savouring the opportunity to tell your Instagram followers that you are, actually, not in London. It is chasing the lustre of a concept brand for cashed-up millennials, yet with this generation facing down a second “once in a lifetime” recession, their needs would be better served with a space that can offer affordable, quiet respite, rather than a brand pressuring its guests to constantly “do”.If Birch put its keen hyperactivity to rest and focused on what it could do well – food and board – then it might reach that hallmark of holistic wellness: considered simplicity. Until then, it is merely another playground for the moderately wealthy, clothed in the marketing babble of inidual absolution.• Accommodation was provided by Birch, which has doubles from £120 room-only (breakfast from £5), birchcommunity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c3f9bbe424eca588a24227d49c0cd2e2e3835c/0_481_7835_4700/master/7835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3d6a05d0d6bd82fd09d0bf5725ff6b1","title":"cuba dollar stores coronavirus","story":"The communist government has been forced to allow citizens to spend US currency at special shops, formalising a split between haves and have-notsOn Paseo del Prado, a boulevard in Havana’s colonial district, dozens of people waited expectantly as the staff raised the shutters to open a tatty but revamped shop.Soon after, Alejandro Domínguez, 23, emerged, brandishing meatballs and a giant tin of chopped tomatoes he had just bought with US currency left as tourist tips at his family’s restaurant. “This is a way to get products you can’t find elsewhere,” he said.The dollar is back in communist Cuba.For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cubans with access to greenbacks are able to buy higher-quality products in exclusive hard currency stores.In the last two years, Cuba has been increasingly boxed in by declining deliveries of cheap oil from its main ally, Venezuela, and hardened sanctions imposed by a Trump administration eyeing the Cuban-American vote in Florida.But the island’s cash crisis was brought to a head by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left Cuba without revenue from tourism for four months.“We’re at a crossroads where there’s practically no other way out,” said Oscar Fernández, professor of economics at the University of Havana. “The state is looking for alternatives so it can keep buying food and medicine.”So on 20 July, the cash-strapped island opened 72 new “dollar stores”, selling everything from cheese to power drills.Cuba last opened dollar stores in 1993 as an emergency stopgap when its economy was tanking during the so-called Special Period. The dollar was taken out of circulation and replaced by the CUC in 2004.The government’s rationale for reopening hard currency stores – to increase supply and to rake in foreign currency – is broadly accepted but the mordant irony of the measure escapes few.Recognising the dollar – possession of which was once a criminal offence – as legal tender is a reluctant nod to the financial power of the United States. But it’s also an implicit admission that the CUC, which is officially pegged at 1:1 with the dollar, is not worth as much as the government claims.The measure draws a line between the haves and the have-nots.On a recent morning, Elio Núñez, 45, a welder who receives dollars from abroad, was queueing outside one of them, hoping to buy soap, coffee, ham or “whatever’s in stock”. Achieving absolute equality, he said, is a chimera. “Some people can afford things, others can’t. It’s like that the world over.”Perhaps with optics in mind, the new supermarkets do not allow customers to pay in cash. Rather, Cubans must deposit greenbacks in a dollar-denominated account and pay by debit card in store.In a stormy speech last month, President Miguel Diáz-Canel said “the enemy” would cast the measure as “economic apartheid”. But dollar stores were necessary, he said, to generate the foreign exchange needed to keep the regular shops Cubans use better supplied.Cuba’s domestic response to Covid-19 has largely been successful, but the fallout has brought longstanding problems with the island’s listless, centrally planned economy to the fore.Agriculture, a perennial achilles heel, has been clobbered: state media recently announced that the country is on track to produce just 160,000 tonnes of rice this year – less than a quarter of what it consumes. Figures like these leave Cuba even more dependent on food imports at a time where there is less cash to make purchases.This dearth of supply brings stark consequences. While there are no queues at bodegas (which guarantee bare-essential food and hygiene products at heavily subsidised prices), queues outside local-currency supermarkets are mammoth.In Regla, one of Havana’s better-supplied municipalities, the state has intensified rationing: people must now take their ID cards to make purchases, and can only buy chicken once a fortnight. Crowds gather before dawn, and by 9am, hundreds are waiting outside the main supermarket. People are sweaty and perturbed. The occasional scrap breaks out.In the east of the island, citizens have set up action groups to stop people cutting in line.Dayana Blázquez, a 35-year-old social worker who was queueing outside a dollar store to buy meat, said that although the effects of US sanctions on the island are “palpable”, decades of economic mismanagement mean the state shares the blame. “Right now things are worse than normal, but we’ve had shortages for years,” she said. “Old and new generations have lived this.”For Blázquez, the inequity of selling some products in dollars runs deep. “It’s not fair for those who work their whole lives and have to depend on others to get by when they retire. It’s not fair for graduates and professionals.

While this may have longer-term economic implications, it has certainly helped these countries to save lives, as evidenced by the significantly lower number of deaths in these countries.”The two researchers said they analysed differing policy responses and subsequent total Covid-19 cases and deaths until 19 May, introducing a number of variables to help analyse the raw data and draw reliable comparisons between countries.Among the datasets considered were GDP, total population, population density and proportion of elderly residents, as well as annual health spending per head, openness to international travel and level of gender equality in society in general.Since only 19 of the nearly 200 countries were led by women, the authors also created so-called “nearest neighbour” countries to offset the small sample size, pairing Germany, New Zealand and Bangladesh with male-led Britain, Ireland and Pakistan.“This analysis clearly confirms that when women-led countries are compared to countries similar to them along a range of characteristics, they have performed better, experiencing fewer cases as well as fewer deaths,” Garikipati said.She added that while female leaders “were risk averse with regard to lives”, locking their countries down significantly earlier than male leaders, that also suggested they were “more willing to take risks in the domain of the economy”.When compared according to the “openness to travel” criterion, female-led countries did not experience significantly lower Covid cases but did report lower deaths, the researchers found, concluding that this may suggest “better policies and compliance”.Garikipati said the evidence of a “significant and systematic difference” showed that even accounting for institutional context and other controls, “being female-led has provided countries with an advantage in the current crisis”.The researchers said they hoped the study would “serve as a starting point to illuminate the discussion on the influence of national leaders in explaining the differences in country Covid-outcomes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc6dc939087b954256df74d52d0337e7e9c72c3/0_175_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786d11069259bb464327fb01587a0c2c","title":"former world leaders call for action to stop lost covid generation","story":"Figures including Tony Blair and Sir John Major say young people shouldn’t be ‘robbed of their education’A group of former world leaders has called for urgent measures to prevent the global health crisis creating a tragic “Covid generation” denied an education.Among the 275-strong group of senior figures are former UK prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, as well as economists, politicians and educationalists from around the world.In a letter addressed to G20 leaders, national governments and global financial institutions, the group call for action to ensure that a generation of young people are not “robbed of their education” due to Covid-19.As countries’ lockdowns come to an end, they warn that as many as 30 million children may never return to school because of the pandemic, according to a Unesco report.They have also raised concerns that the world’s poorest children have been “locked out of learning”, denied internet access and, with the loss of free school meals for pupils across the globe, face the rising threat of hunger. They also state that being in school is the “best defence against forced marriage” for millions of adolescent girls.As part of its proposals, the group suggests that every country should pledge to protect frontline education spending, prioritising the needs of the most disadvantaged children and promoting school participation.It also calls on the international community to increase aid for education, focusing on the most vulnerable, to free up resources for education through debt relief, and for the International Monetary Fund to issue $1.2tn from its global reserve asset towards the countries that need the most support.The letter states: “We write to call for urgent action to address the global education emergency triggered by Covid-19.“With over 1 billion children still out of school because of the lockdown, there is now a real and present danger that the public health crisis will create a Covid generation who lose out on schooling and whose opportunities are permanently damaged.“While the more fortunate have had access to alternatives, the world’s poorest children have been locked out of learning, denied internet access, and with the loss of free school meals – once a lifeline for 300 million boys and girls – hunger has grown.“An immediate concern, as we bring the lockdown to an end, is the fate of an estimated 30 million children who according to Unesco may never return to school.”The letter also highlights the danger of young children being forced into “exploitative and dangerous labour” and progress on gender equity potentially being set back by years.It continues: “We cannot stand by and allow these young people to be robbed of their education and a fair chance in life.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, and Ban Ki-Moon, former UN secretary general, are also among the signatories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93cf95ab11966d5045667dfcc902d7e9d6e036f0/0_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=405ee42058b3c4868d1f9a232652361b","title":"games firm rocksteady accused of lack of action on harassment","story":"Exclusive: Signatory of letter to bosses two years ago makes it public, alleging sexism continuesMore than half of the women employed at the London-based video game developer Rocksteady two years ago signed a letter to bosses accusing the studio of failing to prevent sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in the office, the  can reveal.The letter, dated November 2018 and signed by 10 of the company’s 16 female staff at the time, raised complaints about behaviour including “slurs regarding the transgendered community” and “discussing a woman in a derogatory or sexual manner with other colleagues”, and sexual harassment “in the form of unwanted advances, leering at parts of a woman’s body, and inappropriate comments in the office”.Since then it is claimed that the response has amounted to one training seminar, and that multiple signatories have left the company owing to the lack of action.One of the letter’s signatories, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had decided to share the letter with the  because she felt people were still suffering from sexism, harassment and inappropriate behaviour at Rocksteady.“I have heard everything from groping claims to incidents involving directors, all of whom are men,” she said. “Yet the only thing we had as a result was a company-wide seminar that lasted an hour. Everyone who attended was asked to sign a statement confirming that they’d received the training. It felt that it was a just way for them to cover their arses.”She said the letter was kept private in part due to the company’s devotion to secrecy, which is not unusual in the video game sector, and in part because staff members feared that if they left on bad terms they would be denied credit on the company’s upcoming game, an adaptation of DC Comics’ Suicide Squad.The signatory said the dismissive attitude towards women had in the past carried over into the company’s output. “Rocksteady doesn’t have the best reputation for representing women,” she said, citing the highly sexualised design and costuming of characters such as Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn in previous games. “Sometimes you could see the surprise on their face when you said that’s not how women dress.”Rocksteady acknowledged it had received complaints about sexual discrimination and harassment. “From day one at Rocksteady Studios, we set out to create a place where people are looked after, a place fundamentally built on respect and inclusion,” a spokesperson said.“In 2018 we received a letter from some of our female employees expressing concerns they had at that time, and we immediately took firm measures to address the matters that were raised. Over the subsequent two years we have carefully listened to and learned from our employees, working to ensure every person on the team feels supported. In 2020 we are more passionate than ever to continue to develop our inclusive culture, and we are determined to stand up for all of our staff.”Last Thursday, after the  contacted Rocksteady for comment, management called an all-staff meeting where they discussed the letter for the first time. New initiatives were promised to prevent further discrimination, the  understands.The signatory cited recent changes at the French games firm Ubisoft as another reason for sharing the letter. Last month several executives, including the chief creative officer and second-in-command, Serge Hascoët, resigned amid allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour at the company. Rocksteady, which is owned by Warner Bros Interactive, is one of the leading lights in the UK’s video game development industry and counts the Batman Arkham series among its titles.Video games now account for half of all UK entertainment revenue, with the industry contributing more than £4bn to the economy.

The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong.

I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly.

Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellOver the summer public transport officials held a series of meetings with employer groups and third level colleges, facing an unprecedented need to gauge passenger demand from next month as “normal” post-summer life resumes.The problem of course is that life will not return as normal. Trains, trams and busses will operate much differently and planners must consider what transport in Ireland will look like toward the end of 2020 and into 2021.With strict social distancing requirements slashing capacity and many thousands of people planning to remain working from home, the focus will be on those who have no choice but to get back on board.Detailed data obtained by The  shows very clearly the cataclysmic effect Covid-19 has had on public transport use, at one point shedding about 90 per cent as society shut down to contain the virus.Looming concerns will include the relationship between demand and supply public safety how commuters might be persuaded to change their travel patterns and the prospect of more people opting for private cars.The challenges for what might come are best understood by looking at what has happened so far – in early March, the national transport network came to a grinding halt. As Ireland locked itself away, only a scattering of essential workers climbed on board carriages and buses, making their way to work through empty streets, enjoying a near perfectly functioning system.Its data is stark, illustrated on graphs, as with most things related to the pandemic, by a precipitous downward curve.Transport use by numbersAs a whole, daily PSO (public service) passenger numbers dropped from more than 950,000 at the very beginning of March, to consistently, and often well below 100,000, between the end of March and into May. On March 5th, just before the plummeting decline, the country’s first clusters of coronavirus were confirmed.A swift and steady collapse followed. By the very end of that month, when transport use dipped and remained steadily below the 100,000 figure, it coincided with then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s appeal to the nation to stay at home.The so-called 2km rule was introduced, all but emptying public transport vehicles, with the only travel exceptions permitted for health, social care or other essential work as well as shopping for food or attending medical appointments.A seven day rolling average of the data – which flattens out the peaks and troughs of weekend and weekday usage – shows that Dublin Bus, which had carried by far the largest number of commuters of all services before the pandemic, began to grow consistently beyond the 100,000 mark in early June.This occurred just as Ireland was entering phase two of the lifting of Covid-19 related movement restrictions.By April and early May, Luas usage had shrank to as low as 3 and 4 per cent of its late February level. On March 10th, it had almost 142,000 passenger journeys compared to just under 5,500 on April 18th (a Tuesday and Saturday respectively).Similarly, Bus Éireann had dropped to as low as 5 per cent of passenger use when comparing mid-April with early March. 118,000 passengers on Friday, February 28th, had fallen to 14,700 by Friday, April 17th.On Monday, March 9th, Irish Rail recorded slightly over 198,500 passengers, but by Monday, April 13th, it was just over 2,000.The rural Local Link bus service has seen the fastest recovery during the Covid emergency, having already arrived back at the level of use it experienced in early March.Uncertain futureAnd yet, recovery across the network is not straightforward – accompanying an ongoing social discomfort and wariness, is the Government mandate that each inidual vehicle can only be used to half its capacity.Exactly how the network responds or bounces back in the coming months will depend on a complex interplay of demand, capacity, inidual confidence and what many believe will be a shifting culture in work habits.“Will the long distance commute be changed permanently? I think that’s possible,” said Mr Gaston. “On the other hand, people might find that working from home isn’t that great and might want to go into the office.”September will tell, or begin to tell, but immediately travellers will be faced with the measures that Irish transport authorities have put in place. Aside from capacity reduction, Ireland was one of the first countries to use seat covers with concise Covid-19 messaging across the network.Daily cleaning was introduced, as was protection for drivers. Since July face coverings became mandatory and compliance, according to officials, has been very high.While the system seems primed, efforts are well under way to try and understand what it might have to contend with, in so far as that is possible.The NTA has had a number of meetings with employers groups including Ibec and Chambers Ireland, as well as with third level educational institutions. The idea is not just to try and gauge how many people might be standing on platforms and at bus stops from early September, but to try and encourage a shift in behaviour that would keep limited capacity free for those with limited capacity to alter their travelling timetables.There have already been shifts. In the Covid era, people have been increasingly travelling at quieter times, notably between 10am to 2pm. Although there is less capacity on the network, this fanning out of commuter demand would greatly increase efficiency in the use of what capacity is available.Transit authorities in a number of countries are beginning to send out a similar message.“Behaviours can be changed if people understand the reasons for it and if it still provides the services that they need.”October and November will be an early test – these are traditionally the busiest months on public transport with workers less inclined to take holidays and students in classes full time.Commuter flexibilityThe NTA has raised the issue of working hour flexibility, particularly now that a grand experiment has proved the ability for large swathes of the working population to do so from home, even if just on a part time or shared basis.“The strong sense that we are getting is that there will not be the same massive return in September of workers.”However, the question of Irish transport and population mobility is more complicated than what happens in the coming months and Covid has thrown it into sharp, often urgent focus.The urgency for some comes in the form of private car use which had come back much faster than public transport for obvious reasons (although Mr Gaston said this had levelled off against a slow but steady rise in public transport).Faced with similar problems, Transport For London recently acknowledged the post-recovery need for “safe space for people to use active, sustainable and socially distanced modes of travel”, that would help prevent a “damaging car-led recovery”.“We must avoid a car-led recovery which would cause gridlock and only make things worse,” said transport commissioner Andy Byford. “So my message to Londoners returning to public transport is we are doing everything to keep things clean and safe for everyone.”Conor Faughnan, director of consumer affairs at the AA, said while the roads were extremely quiet on the June bank holiday weekend, the August bank holiday was almost the same as last year. While the private car is in resurgence, much like public transport the next couple of months will be the true test.So far, noted Mr Faughnan, there has been no return to morning rush hour traffic and businesses are still working out what to do with employees.“There may be some sort of new paradigm,” he said. “We will just have to wait and see.”OpportunityDavid O’Connor, transport expert and assistant head of school at TU Dublin Environment and Planning, believes Covid has brought about an opportunity for the sector.He sets out an immediate future of fewer passengers, higher costs and a work operating environment that for safety and health concerns, could make more people inclined to opt for the shelter of their own cars.“They are putting in cycling and walking measures but they should also be looking at putting in public transport measures as well,” he said.“As a planner I can see that everything is changing the rule book has been almost thrown out.”The performance of public transport timetables during the pandemic lockdown offered a brief taste to Irish commuters, albeit a small number of them, of how networks operate in cities like Zurich and Stockholm, he said. A positive legacy of this 21st century pandemic could be transport investment.“The idea behind Bus Connects becomes even more strategic,” he said, adding that the time is arguably now to embrace “smoothed travel patterns”, essentially doing away with two rush hour peaks redesigning transport vehicles to give passengers greater space and providing hand sanitiser to compliment the wearing of masks.“The most important thing is to do this carefully.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA full Cabinet meeting is taking place, with Ministers expected to discuss further coronavirus restrictions.Ministers are discussing increased powers for gardaí to enforce the coronavirus lockdown as well as amended advice for the over-70s that would tell them to limit the time they spend outdoors and in company.Political sources confirmed the Government’s public health experts have advised greater powers for the gardaí to police social gatherings, both in pubsrestaurants and at private house parties, amid growing concerns about the behaviour of younger people.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was briefed on Monday night after a lengthy meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) discussed the recent sharp increase in the number of cases. He was expected to bring recommendations to the Cabinet when it met at 1pm on Tuesday.The Cabinet meeting was scheduled late on Monday night – in place of a previously arranged meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 – in a sign that legally binding decisions are expected. Only the full Cabinet has the authority to make decisions of the Government.AmendmentsIt was also expected Ministers would be asked to approve amendments to the advice to over-70s that encourages them to limit interactions with other people, shop during designated hours and wear face coverings. In a bid to curb house parties, gatherings are likely to be restricted to groups of six from no more than three households.Political sources say the public health experts have been alarmed by the recent increase in cases and have been putting the case for further restrictions forcefully to Ministers in private. However, there is also reluctance among some Ministers to reverse the easing of the lockdown as they believe that public tolerance with some of the measures is thinning. There is also a belief among some Ministers that NPHET is being overly cautious.Ministers were also likely to discuss the plans for school reopening and the progress on producing the Leaving Certificate results. After the UK government abandoned its process for estimating A-levels results yesterday, deciding to rely on teachers’ predicted grades only, the Department of Education has come under pressure to reassure students they will not see the widespread marking down of the teacher-estimated grades when the results are published next month.Responding to reports that among the measures to be announced this afternoon is a requirement for older people to again restrict their time outside their home and avoid settings with lots of people, Trinity College Dublin geriatrician professor Rose Anne Kenny said she had concerns about moves to restrict the movement of older people. Fresh air and movement were critical to boost the immune system and older people had more vulnerable immune systems, she said.“It doesn’t make sense” to suggest that such people not be active, nor did selecting “a chronological number”.“I don’t see how that will resolve things. There needs to be improved testing and tracing,” she told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show.On the same programme immunologist Dr Tómas Ryan, associate professor of biochemistry in Trinity College Dublin, said the reality was that shielding does not work and said the Government was losing control of the Covid-19 situation.Testing-and-tracingHe said the State’s testing-and-tracing system had “fallen down” and turnaround time for test results were getting slower. Prof Ryan said the time between noticing symptoms and tracking contacts needed to be 72 hours, but at present it was an average of four days.Dr Ryan called for a “complete overhaul” of the Government’s Covid-19 strategy, he said.NPHET said on Monday evening an additional 56 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in the State. The news follows the reporting of an additional 266 cases over the weekend.The latest figures see the total number of deaths in the Republic remain at 1,774, while the total number of confirmed cases now stands at 27,313.Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally warned that Ireland is heading into an “age-related apartheid” approach to dealing with Covid-19.The number of cases in Ireland was going in the wrong direction he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show. “Something’s got to be done.”It was notable that recent cases were predominantly among young people, he said while older people were “doing their best to dodge this deadly virus.”Dr Scally said he did not known what gain there might be from further restrictions for older people.“I can see how stopping house parties would be valuable. But I do have a kind of a worry that we’re heading into some sort of an age-related apartheid approach to Covid-19.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"US president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Four low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph:  Stefan RousseauPA Wire Britain’s education secretary tried on Tuesday to defend a U-turn over a school exam grading system used to replace cancelled tests, which opponents said was another example of the government’s incompetent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.On Monday, the government ditched a mathematical model used to assess grade predictions made by teachers which had lowered results for almost 40 per cent of students taking their main school-leaving exams.University places depend on the results but many students found their grades had been downgraded, meaning they failed to meet their provisional offers.The action only came after days of criticism of the algorithm from distraught students, angry teachers and disgruntled Conservative as well as Labour MPs.Opponents said the exam was the latest failing by prime minister Boris Johnson’s government in its response to the pandemic, following criticism it was slow to impose a lockdown, failed to provide enough protective equipment to healthcare staff and bungled a plan to get pupils back to school.More than 41,000 Britons have died in the pandemic, tens of thousands of jobs have been lost, and life is far from returning to normal.“The Tories’ handling of these results sums up their handling of this pandemic: incompetent,” Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Twitter.LampoonedMr Johnson and education secretary Gavin Williamson were lampooned on the front pages of British newspapers on Tuesday after what the papers described as a “humiliating” U-turn, which days earlier the government had ruled out.Facing the media on Tuesday, Mr Williamson said the government had acted after realising there were “too many anomalies”, suggesting the blame lay with officials behind the algorithm.“The right thing to do . . . when it was clear that the system wasn’t delivering what we believed, and what we’d been assured that it would do, and the fairness that we all expect it to deliver . . . then further action had to be taken, that’s what I did,” Mr Williamson told Sky News.A snap opinion poll published on Monday showed 75 per cent of respondents thought the government had handled the situation badly and 40 per cent thought Mr Williamson should resign. He said he would not quit.The change also puts pressure on universities, as more students have obtained the grades needed to get into their first choice institution. Mr Williamson said the government was working on how to boost their capacity.“This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities – particularly with the social distance measures in place,” Universities UK, the body which represents the sector, said.The government’s decision refers only to England. Scotland faced a similar situation and changed its policy last week, and Wales and Northern Ireland have also dropped the algorithm method, which factored in the past performance of the schools as a whole.Critics of the system said this disproportionately hit students from disadvantaged backgrounds. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"europe avoided uk style exam meltdown","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has massively impacted education and exams across Europe, but nowhere have claims of catastrophe been on a par with those in the UK.While outrage rises over the Government\u0027s handling of this year\u0027s exam results and the appalling chasm between predicted and actual grades, some countries on the continent have bumped up continuous assessment marks while others have stuck to traditional exams despite the health risks.In France, the end-of-year exam known as the baccalauréat or Bac, equivalent to A-levels, was cancelled this year for the first time since its inception in 1808 under Napoleon.Instead, the country\u0027s 740,000 final-year students received an average score in each subject, based on marks they had been awarded for tests and coursework during the year.Local juries were tasked with assessing, and if necessary adjusting, grades according to a national average and on the past examination records of schools. Marks obtained during the lockdown period were not taken into account.Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, called the system “the most simple, secure and fair solution in these difficult times”.This has forced the French government to create about 10,000 extra university places for the most popular subjects. Jean Castex, the prime minister, called the results generous. They marked the highest rise in pass rates since 1968 after huge student strikes ended in marks based on continuous assessment with an 80 per cent success rate - some 20 per cent higher than the previous year.Gilles Roussel, head of France’s university presidents’ conference, CPU, denied the Bac was devalued this year as places were anyway based on marks throughout the previous year and “often the first term”. Students would have to play catch-up on certain subjects, however, he added.In neighbouring Germany, all 16 states decided to push ahead with their end-of-year Abitur qualifications after heated debate.While schools were closed during the March-June exam period, small groups of pupils sat tests at a distance of 1.5 metres in well-aired classrooms instead of halls.Despite the different approach,  most German states also reported higher than usual results. Fears that stress and health concerns could affect performance proved baseless. Indeed, experts speculated that pupils may have been able to focus more due to a lack of distractions.The Netherlands, too, recorded a higher pass rate after its central school-leaving exams were cancelled, with schools awarding final marks on the basis of course work and the schools’ own tests, which pupils were also allowed to resit.While almost five times as many high schools as usual reported a 100 per cent pass rate, according to one survey, the education ministry dismissed claims that the exams had been devalued.“This group of pupils had to take school exams under unexpected and difficult circumstances,” a spokeswoman told the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, adding that the cancellation of the central exams meant pupils had more time to study for the school exams.For Spain\u0027s Selectividad university entrance exams, candidates chose three out of a selection of five questions and were not tested on anything learned during lockdown. Each region was responsible for creating its own coronavirus exam procedure.The pass rate across the country was within one percentage point of 2019, aside from students in northern Catalonia, hard-hit by the virus, where a majority of them did significantly better than in 2019. Some 67 per cent more scored above nine – out of a possible 10 – than in the previous year.In Italy, around 500,000 students took only the oral part of their high-school diploma while wearing face masks but the normal three written tests were cancelled. Marks were generally higher than in previous years amid reports of “generous” examiners who awarded the maximum possible score in 9.9 per cent of cases, compared with just 5.6 per cent in 2019.The Czech Republic and Slovakia postponed end-of-school exams.Sweden, meanwhile, is set to cancel the second round of  its scholastic aptitude tests, which helps many get places at university after scrapping the first round in March.They are likely to be replaced by two exams in 2021 instead, the education ministry said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"everyday voters become stars show democratic conventions opening","story":"Eric from Illinois explained why he regretted voting for Donald Trump in 2016, drink in hand and looking down at the camera as if on a poorly set-up Skype call. Kristin laid bare the searing pain of losing her father to Covid-19 before declaring that “his only preexisting condition” was “trusting” the US president. Kevin, a former marine, spoke of Joe Biden’s warmth during a surprise encounter at an official function, joking: “You can’t fake that type of a smile.” As this strangest of Democratic conventions finally kicked off on Monday evening, it was not the celebrities (of which there were some) or the politicians\u0027 speeches (of which there were many) that are likely to have proved most effective on swing voters.Instead it was the voices of everyday voters, weaved into the two hours of programming at regular junctures, that may have been the most politically adroit aspect of this new made-for-TV spectacle in the age of coronavirus. Eric’s story was especially impactful. It came in the opening third of the convention and chimed with the heart of Mr Biden’s strategy for winning back the White House - wooing moderate voters tempted by Mr Trump four years ago. He said he had ticked the Trump box in 2016 but regretted it now. “I challenge you to think back to what made you vote for Donald Trump back in November 2016”, Eric said in a direct message to his fellow Republicans. He referenced the crises of the pandemic and the economic crash, calling this election “bigger than any political party” and adding: “We have a chance to look ourselves in the mirror and go vote for a proven leader.”If Mr Biden wins back the Rust Belt that Mr Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 it could well be thanks to voters like Eric, white men who were swayed by the Trump pitch at the last election but have since become disillusioned. These normal voters gave the convention’s first night a human feel and some grounding in a programme that risked appearing stilted with speeches given by politicians standing alone without the usual backdrop of cheering crowds. Coronavirus ruined the Democrats’ original plans to hold an in-person gathering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the mould of the conventions of old. There were fears that in its place would be something more boring and less engaging. In fact, if night one is anything to go by, what emerged instead was two hours of tight broadcasting which may well have kept the prime-time US television audience’s attention much better than the full-day conventions of the past. Speeches were kept short. Instead of politicians milking the limelight by spending minutes of their speech explaining their personal story - with one eye on future elections - they made their points quick and then wrapped up. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, appeared in his now familiar Covid-19 briefing set-up, with slides and all, to ram home his belief that the US president had failed the moment.Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman whose endorsement is widely seen as the turning point in Mr Biden’s Democratic primary tussle - he won the state, his first in the campaign, just days later - focussed on the “we know Joe” line, a message of reassurance. There were touches of glitz. Eva Longoria, the Desperate Housewives star, hosted the proceedings dressed in white, acting as a guide as she moved from one item to the next and weaved in the night’s theme of “we the people”. Megan Rapinoe, the US football team’s World Cup star, led a discussion. Wyclef Jean performed a bizarre song at the official pre-convention event talking about “smoking grass” with Bernie Sanders and running for president.There were also elements which struggled to connect. After each big speech, in an attempt to mask the lack of an audience, the camera cut to random supporters watching at home who applauded silently, some looking a little uncomfortable. But throughout the two hours a tight focus in message was kept on painting Mr Biden as a man of empathy, who rose up from the middle classes and - in what Democrats claim is a contrast to Mr Trump - understands what people are going through right now. One especially effective video showed an old Amtrak worker describing how Mr Biden, travelling back and forth constantly from Delaware to Washington DC while a senator to look after his children after their mother died, became a friend.  He said when he got ill Mr Biden, then vice president, called to check in on him. The voter videos - of farmers who face losing their livelihoods in the recession to couples who are struggling to get postal ballots and mothers who fear for their children’s return to school - backed up exactly that image. People, polls suggest, are more swayed by the views of a friend than any other message carrier during an election campaign.The voice of everyday folks, more than the Democratic Party’s cream of the crop, may prove to be the most effective bit of this week’s convention. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/18/08/barack-obama-megan-thee-stallion.jpg","title":"barack obama summer playlist 2020 megan thee stallion chicks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Billie Eilish,\u0026nbspBeyoncé and Princess Nokia also make appearances on annual listBarack Obama has announced his annual summer playlist for 2020, with Megan thee Stallion, Billie Eilish and The Chicks’ “Gaslighter” all making appearances.“Over the past few months, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to music with my family,” Obama wrote on his social media. “I wanted to share some of my favourites from the summer.“As always, it’s a mix of genres that travels through various eras.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearSuch investment may have contributed to the recent gains but could ultimately cause the price to stall, market analysts have warned.“As bitcoin’s steady push higher continues, it is worth bearing in mind that a high bitcoin price can sometimes create a psychological barrier for the retail investor,” Simon Peters, from the online investment platform eToro, told The Independent.“Just like investors can get fractional shares, cryptocurrency investors can hold fractions of bitcoins. Yet the fact remains that many retail investors will want whole bitcoins and the price of attaining them is moving further out of reach.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Without this, we risk a disproportionate response to problems that could be dealt with through straightforward managerial action. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The government risks making a major misstep by dismantling its own Public Health agency at such a crucial time, creating a huge distraction for staff who should be dedicating themselves to the next stage of the pandemic.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There is no clear argument as to why this rebranding and reshuffling will solve some of the problems highlighted by the secretary of state today.”\u0026nbspRichard Murray, chief executive of health think tank The King\u0027s Fund, was equally critical of Mr Hancock\u0027s decision to break up PHE.Undoubtedly, there are questions to be answered about England\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 crisis, but the middle of a pandemic is not the time to dismantle England\u0027s public health agency, Mr Murray said.New National Institute for Health Protection announcedMatt Hancock has announced the formation of a new organisation, the National Institute for Health Protection, which will replace Public Health England.He said the new organisation will protect “people from external threats to this country’s health”.“To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus and spotting and tackling other external health threats now and in the future, we need to bring together the science and the skill into one coherent whole.“So today, I am announcing that we are forming a new organisation, the National Institute for Health Protection.“The National Institute for Health Protection will have a single and relentless mission: protecting people from external threats to this country’s health. External threats like biological weapons, pandemics and, of course, infectious diseases of all kinds.”France to make face coverings mandatory in work placesFrance will make wearing face masks mandatory in work places from 1 September, with some exceptions, the head of a leading union told BFM TV on Tuesday.Yves Veyrier, leader of Force ouvriere, said the government “deems it necessary to wear a mask when you’re not alone (in the work place)”, adding the labour minister made it clear it was up to the companies concerned to pay for the masks.France’s High Council for Public Health recommended that mask-wearing be made compulsory in all workplaces as the daily infection numbers surged past 3,000 for the first time since May.According to French newspaper Journal du Dimanche, French labour minister Elisabeth Borne is laying out the new requirements today. Face masks could be required in collective spaces and during meetings, but could be taken off in private offices, it was reported.One-person households twice as likely to test positive for Covid-19Data from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey found that people in one-person households were estimated to be around twice as likely to test positive for coronavirus than those in two-person households.The ONS said it will investigate why one-person households appear more likely to test positive. It added there was no evidence to suggest that those living in larger households than two people were at higher or lower risk of testing positive than those living in two-person households.“There is some evidence to suggest that household size affects the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid-19 on a swab test taken between 8 June and 2 August 2020,” said the ONS.“Those in one-person households were estimated to be around 2.1 times more likely to test positive for Covid-19 on a swab test than those in two-person households.“Recently, we have introduced new questions in the study about contacts, so we will investigate why those in one-person households might be more likely to test positive in a future article.”Less than a third of people who test positive reported Covid symptoms, data showsNew figures show that less than a third of people testing positive for coronavirus reported having symptoms of the disease.According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), an analysis found only around 28 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus reported any symptoms at the time of their swab test or at either the preceding or subsequent tests.The remaining 72 per cent of positive cases either did not report having any specific or general symptoms on the day of their positive swab test, preceding or subsequent swab tests, or did not answer both questions, the ONS added.“This suggests there is a potentially large number of asymptomatic cases, but it is important to note that symptoms were self-reported rather than professionally diagnosed,” said the ONS.Respondents were asked to report symptoms including fever, muscle ache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, headache, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loss of taste or loss of smell.Irish health chiefs back more coronavirus restrictions - reportPublic health officials in Ireland have recommended that older people be urged to limit time spent outdoors and gatherings in homes be restricted to six people to control the spread of coronavirus.According to a report by the Irish Independent, health chiefs met on Monday to decide if more restrictions were needed to stem a growing spread of Covid-19.Government and officials have called the rise in cases deeply concerning. The cabinet will meet later today to consider the recommendations.Ireland’s restrictions now limit gatherings to 50, while 10 visitors from no more than four different households are allowed in the homes of anyone else to limit house parties.Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As a large population of the country decide against the risk of holidaying abroad, the South West of England is welcoming more guests than ever – but face the risks associated.Based on stats alone it would appear Devon and Cornwall have gotten off lightly when it comes to Coronavirus.The South Hams was one of the first places in the UK to report a case of Covid-19, but since then there have been just over 2,000 more cases in Devon, with about 900 having been reported in Cornwall since early March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile other picturesque parts of the country such as Cumbria suffered during lockdown with day-trippers blamed for spreading the virus, the Westcountry - stung by those early cases - shut up shop quickly with a police force determined to enforce the letter of the law and angry, social-media savvy locals armed with smartphones and a passion for passive aggression ready to expose any second-home owners flouting the rules.There are many in the South West who would prefer it to have stayed that way, but this is a region which relies heavily on its tourism industry.‘Unprecedented’ surge in 999 calls due to influx of tourists in Devon“It has got to the point where we had to open again,” says Victoria Norris, 46, who runs Tall Ships Creamery ice cream shop in Charlestown on the south Cornwall coast.“Only time will tell if we have made the right decision. We have had a lot of holidaymakers down here and by the beginning of September we will know how lucky we have been.”Victoria was so concerned by the spread of the virus that she shut down her business before the government made closure compulsory. She also refused to reopen until June - after her engineer fiancé Scott Anstey had completely revamped her two small shops in the village to ensure they were completely Covid-safe.She only allows one household into the shop at a time and employs a strict two-metre social distancing rule at all times.“When we were closed there was a lot of pressure from people asking when we were going to open again, but I wasn’t prepared to risk my staff, their families or myself,” Victoria said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“I won’t change what I have done. If we ever get back to a point of everything being safe I will keep my shops as they are.“When people come down on holiday they do forget about the virus and social distancing just goes out of the window. We have a two-metre rule in the shop and some people love it while others think it is ridiculous…but we don’t want to get ill.“I went kayaking the other day and I heard someone with a northern accent on the beach. They were doing no social distancing whatsoever and it just made me want to jump in the sea and get away as quickly as possible.“I won’t go to the beach. I keep myself to myself. There are just too many people at the moment.”The last few months have taken their toll regardless of the virus stats. Any further delay in easing lockdown would have even more businesses facing closure than have already done so.Now hotels, B\u0026ampBs, campsites, theme parks, ice cream vendors are all open again and have rarely been busier, boosted by a nation of holidaymakers desperate for a sense of freedom but fearful that overseas travel could mean contracting the virus, a two-week spell in quarantine on their return, or both.And therein lies the catch-22 for many in Devon and Cornwall – they have to reopen and welcome visitors from other parts of the UK where the virus is more prevalent in order for survive economically, but what will the cost be to their own health?Croyde and Georgeham in North Devon is home to one of the country’s most magnificent beaches and anything up to 10,000 holidaymakers in peak season – but a mere 700 or so hardy souls out of it.“It’s probably busier now than in previous years, but that’s because people are staying in the UK rather than going abroad,” says parish council chairman John Symonds, who has counted himself among those 700 his whole life.“Holidaymakers aren’t adhering to social distancing, it’s carnage down there. One campsite has a rule of 10 metres between each tent, but another site has got 1,200 people packed into a small field. What can you do?“People and businesses have had it hard out there and now they are trying to catch up. You cannot blame them for taking the money now it’s on offer. I don’t think it will cause a second spike, but it’s obvious something will happen here.”Sam Scott, a resident of neighbouring Ilfracombe for 15 years, agrees.“At the start of lockdown I would have been outraged at holidaymakers coming down here, but now I’m more accepting of it,” he says.“Yes I am concerned about holidaymakers spreading the virus, but I would be more concerned about holiday businesses around North Devon going under. It’s a really fine line between protecting vulnerable people in the community and in Devon hospitals, and looking after local businesses.“If people weren’t on holiday I like to think they would be a bit more sensible when it comes to social distancing, but I can understand them not doing it – they are on holiday and want to relax.”Sunseekers have certainly seen the recent heatwave as an opportunity to make the most of the South West.From Lulworth Cove to Bubleigh Salterton, from St Ives to Bude, Woolacombe to Minehead and every beach in between, accents from all over the country can be heard - as commonplace as the pasty shops.The corner of the UK is thronging with people is nothing new in summer, but when you add in the need for social distancing the narrow lanes and 50cm wide cobbled pavements only heighten the sense of claustrophobia.Kirstie Allsopp defends decision to film in Devon during lockdownIn Totnes cars have been banned completely from the narrow main road through the town on Saturday mornings in order to allow pedestrian shoppers to socially distance – it’s simply impossible to do so otherwise.Other resorts such as Perranporth in North Cornwall have put cones down in the roads of the busiest streets and employed marshalls in an attempt to widen the pavements.“It’s better than nothing,” said one local resident. “You speak to tourists who say they have come down here to get away from the virus…but I’m thinking ‘you could be bringing it down to us’.“At this time of year it’s usually busy, but this year it’s just gone completely mental. We will be lucky to not get a second spike.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Mr Williamson said: They wont be fined and were removing those caps on every single university in the United Kingdom, so that they have the ability to expand the number of places, welcoming more students into those universities, as many as possible.His words suggest the Government will be encouraging unis to take as many people as they can.It will depend entirely on the university, but yes you should now be able to get a spot with your first choiceyou now have the correct marks.Last night the Government said it wanted universities to honour all the offers they had made, as long as students get the grades.Universities may still decide to give a student a placetheir new grades meet their offers.But its not yet clear whether they have a legal obligation to do this or it will depend on how nice they are feeling.But theres also the issue of space.Universities often offer more places than they have available because not all students given an offer will be able to make the grades required to take up the spot, and some will choose not to too.Even though the cap on numbers has been ripped up there are practical problems - such as space in lecture theatres and tutorial rooms - that could mean not everyone will get a place. You should be now able to get a place, but there is no guarantee of this.It will depend on your first choice university and whether they have the space for you.This means a huge scramble for kids to try and get a place swapped - while trying to make sure they keep their insurance offer in case that doesnt happen.Thousands of other kids have swiped up spots through clearing. The best thing that can be done will be to contact your uni with your new grades and send them proof of your teacher predicted marks.They will then be able to make a call on whether they have space for you.UCAS will be meeting with schools and universities to thrash out how to make decisions after the shambolic results process. A spokesperson said: “In response to the announcements across the UK regarding the awarding of A levels, UCAS is now working with universities, colleges and schools to support students to understand their options and achieve their place in higher education. “For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately. Once your university has your ‘Centre Assessed Grades ’ via exam bodies they can make a decision as to whether there is a place at your preferred choice.“We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”Universities have said they are waiting for further information on what this means. If universities do want to offer a place but they are now full up, they could offer a deferral until next year.While this is far from ideal, it means many will be able to go to uni in  instead.Mary Curnock Cook, formerly UCAS chief executive, told the BBC kids could have to take gap years because there simply isnt enough places at universities now.She said: There are literally tens of thousands of students who decisions have already been made about who they accept and dont accept.This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.Many have filled their places rightly and now they are being asked to take in potentially tens of thousands of people moved back to their centre assessed grades.There will be some courses that are just physically full and may have to offer deferrals.However, poorer students who dont want to take a year off will face dficulty as the job market is crashing because of the coronavirus.And many kids thinking about travelling will be put off by quarantines and other restrictions which could limit their options.The University of York said: We are working hard to respond to the latest announcement from the UK Government about results for confirmation and clearing. We are awaiting further details and we will provide more information and guidance to students as soon as we can.Some universities will offered deferred spaces for next year because of lack of space in particular coursez. University College London has said they will accept all pupils given an offer, but are still working out how this will apply to courses such as medicine - which had a cap on numbers based on practical constraints.The London university said: UCL’s priority is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, recognising that they have worked hard during unprecedented circumstances and deserve their first choice university.  We are delighted to accept all students who meet the terms of their original offer on all programmes that do not have an externally-determined cap . For those students who have met our offer to study medicine based on teacher-assessed grades but do not yet have a place confirmed, we are working with the relevant agencies about places this year and we will guarantee a deferred place for next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A stf of a game show dreamt up by Simon Cowell’s Over The Top Productions company and hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who charged on to the set, Saturday night, shouting: “Oh yes, I hope you’re ready. This is going to be good.”It wasn’t, obviously. It was going to be anything but good.Rolling In It is a show where every single thing is working against it being good, in fact, from the fixtures and fittings to the ropey old format where they’ve attempted to fuse the random “thrill” of Tipping Point with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , minus the decent cash prize.The technology here isn’t exactly state of the art either. It’s an old arcade game. So, before answering  lobotomised questions , the contestants must roll a gigantic coin down a chute which can end up in a cash prize basket, but more often than not ends up bankrupting them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, as you’ve probably noticed, is currently playing exactly the same game with the British economy and probably thinks Rolling In It is a fantastic idea for a game show.ITV in its heart of hearts, though, clearly does not. How can you tell Because they’ve had to ditch the normal, run-of-the-mill contestants and partner-up some visibly reluctant ITV celebs with X Factor-style “characters” who are meant to ert your attention from the game.Saturday night, we had a live wire called Jana, who announced her arrival by telling Mulhern he’d “lost weight”. “What ”The week before there was another handful by the name of Lesley, who brought proceedings to a temporary halt, at the introductions’ stage, with this announcement. “I arrange funerals.”I’d stick around then, Lesley. I’ve checked this show’s vital signs and I think we’re talking weeks rather than months.I worry, too, about the long-term prospects of ITV in the current climate.The share price is down, advertising’s hit an all-time low, Ant  Dec are wintering in Rhyl and the new home for I’m A Celeb is literally a folly.The very remote possibility exists, I will admit, that Rolling In It is part of a deep-state plan to frighten everyone back to work — “Return to the office NOW, or you’re getting a second series of this rubbish.”But I don’t think we really need to look beyond the obvious lockdown explanation here.The cupboard is bare.ITV has simply run out of anything  worth showing, we’re now on to the stuff that was never meant to see the light of day, and as good as it’s ever going to get for Rolling In It is Gemma Collins revealing that: “My intuition is telling me shot put.”Then please go with your intuition, Gemma. Team GB demands it.Nasser Hussein: “The three non-negotiable players were Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe and Gough.”Paul Merson: “Every City signing is just another cog in the jigsaw.”Steven Gerrard: “The quality on the bench is the quality that’s not even on the bench.” BBC’S re-run of the original and arguably best Line Of Duty series concluded, last night, with the Organised Crime Gang still on the loose and DCI Tony Gates putting his tortured Irish wolfhound out of its misery before killing himself.The character I always feel sorry for, watching this  version of the show, though, is Jackie Laverty, Gates’ miserable girlfriend, who had her throat slit in the second episode.She was then stashed in Terry’s freezer, just behind the crispy pancakes and Cornettos, until her corpse was dramatically rediscovered in the fourth episode of the fth series, in April , looking almost as gormless as DI Buckells.In the process, she missed: The show’s big move to Belfast, in series two, the DI Denton years, with Keeley Hawes, balaclava man, Thandie Newton’s appearance, Ted Hastings’ long, dark nights of the soul at the Edge Park hotel, and DS Steve Arnott’s subtle transition from grey tank tops to lurid waistcoats, straight after he slept with DC Georgia Trotman at the beginning of the second run.I’d imagine Jackie actress Gina McKee casts a frosty stare or two in the direction of her agent as well.Line Of Duty may never have been so gloriously easy to understand, or free from abbreviations, as it was in series one, but while her character’s been solidying at Terry’s gaff it has become the most consistently brilliant drama of the decade.Sadly for her, Jackie Laverty is not actually due to defrost fully until series seven and the next runis going to be the last.No official word yet as to when that production will reach our screens but, you can guarantee already, Line Of Duty’s final episodes will be the television event of the year.BBC’s new sitcom Mandy  Well I came and I watched without laughing.

But her skills don’t stop at food. Suzanne says: “So many of us have hundreds of things whizzing around our heads.“Batching is arranging them into sets you can do together. Changing small things about mundane tasks can have a major effect.“It’s simple, saves time and money and gives you headspace.”Here, Suzanne reveals her top tips to “batch your le” by grouping tasks . . . DECIDING what to wear each day seems easy enough.Butyou have just ten minutes before getting the kids ready, it can actually be rushed and stressful.So, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, why not treat yourself to  minutes of your own time and get ahead Head upstairs and have a think about what you have coming up for each day of that coming week.Select an outfit for each of the days, evenit is just leggings and gym gear for some of them. In a very short time, you will find that you no longer have to stress as you jump out of bed in the morning.Can’t remember that nice outfit you wore last week but which made you feel great Simply snap a quick mirror photo of you dressed each morning.Then, on a Sundayyou are struggling for ideas, you can simply scroll back on outfits you liked wearing the week before.Doing this will help you feel ahead of the game and should make your mornings less frantic.LAST-MINUTE gt-buying can be expensive, as well as stressful and time-consuming.Make a list of all the birthdays you ought to know, then at the start of each month – or just after pay day – buy all the cards and presents in a single trip.Buying cards and wrapping paper in bulk, like I have here, left, is so much cheaper than buying them inidually from a corner shop.Wrap, label and even write the cards so they are ready to be handed out when needed.If you have kids constantly going to class parties, ask them to write a list of all the boys and girls, then allocate a cost for each child.Your children can choose an item for the boys and another for the girls. Buy these in bulk and keep them in a cupboard so you simply “grab and go” for each party, without having to constantly worry about the invites that come through the door.ARGH! No one likes going through their bills . . . and this job often gets put to one side until it mounts up.Why not spend  minutes putting them all together in a folder  Make a front page with a list of all bills and paperwork, with their due dates. Add a plastic wallet containing some stamps, paper and envelopes to the folder.Then look at your usual week and see when you might have some spare time.For example, I always have one hour on a Monday night while my kids play hockey. I keep this folder in the boot of the car then “batch” all my household bills and paperwork into this free period before posting them on the way home from hockey.As bills and paperwork come in through the letterbox, I add them to the folder and leave it until the following Monday.Another top tip is to sit down once every three months and look at what bills you can add to standing orders so they are automatically paid in smaller amounts.WITH emails and phone messages flooding in all the time, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. So batch them.Use your inbox only for anything that NEEDS to be done. All other correspondence can be moved into folders, eventhey are just to keep for reference.Set up separate email folders for work, home le and school so they are easy to find. Use the first  minutes of each working day to run through emails.File as many as possible and answer the easy ones. Click the “unsubscribe” box for emails from companies you do not wish to hear from so you receive less unwanted mail.Designate fixed times when you clear your inbox – say, after lunch and  minutes before the end of the working day. Less stress all round.I CAN hear the sceptical laughter already! But busy weeks often mean we never get to spend quality time with our partners.Booking in a time each week can work wonders for couples.Choose one night a week when you both make an effort to eat and chat together.Earmark the same night each week as “our night”. Give the kids an early supper and send them to play in their bedrooms so you can be on your own.Dedicating this time and making it part of your meal planning will instantly put some romance back into your le.SWIMMING, PE, football, hockey . . . the list of kits needed throughout the week can seem endless.Take  minutes and ask the whole family to look at what unorms they need for the week ahead.Consider picking up some cheap drawstring bags from a pound shop so each kit can have its own bag.Then get everyone to put the bags they need in the car on a Sunday night, so only one evening is spent organising.At the end of the week, you can take out all of the bags and wash everything together. Afterwards, get everyone to refill their bags so the kits don’t disappear upstairs.Not enough time to do some exercise yourself  Use the time when you are waiting for kids to finish clubs to meet a friend at the club and go for a run and a chat.TRYING to give the family a balanced diet on a budget and without spending hours every night cooking and washing up is tricky.But by “batching”, these problems disappear.Write a plan for the week. Look at which nights you are busy or home late and which nights you have more time.On the nights you are busy, plan easy meals such as pizza and pesto pasta. On quiet nights, make a spag bol or a curry and double the amount. Freeze the extra portion so you can use it on a busy night the following week.It will only take an additional five minutes on the night of cooking, yet gives you a whole night off the next week.If you want to be super-organised, spend one hour on a Sunday cooking a few meals and making some healthy lunches for the week ahead.Did you know you can freeze sandwiches IT is straightforward to batch chores such as laundry, vacuuming and cleaning.Dedicate a particular time in the week to do each, so you don’t need to think about it for the rest of the week.If you put on a clothes wash every day, get into a routine of when that will be. For example, I do a wash after dinner and hang it up before bed. That way it is easy to get a good rotation going and I don’t end up with piles of dirty washing.Start allocating some of the work to the rest of the family.

Julian Hamilton-Shield, professor of diabetes and metabolic endocrinology at the University of Bristol, said the findings mirrored anecdotal evidence from across England in recent months.  Diabetes is a le-long condition caused by high levels of glucose - or sugar - in the blood which affects around . million people in the UK.Type- diabetes typically occurs in childhood, or before the age of , and is not linked to obesity.It is treated with daily insulin injections or an insulin pump - but it can be le-threatening.

The research found there was a sizeable dference in the time spent learning for primary school pupils. For secondary school children the gap was no greater than it was before the lockdown. All students were learning less at home overall, the research found. The average primary school student was only spending . hours on a typical day during lockdown - compared to six hours when theyre in a classroom. Secondary school pupils saw a similar drop in time spent learning, down  per cent from . hours at school to . hours a day at home.Boris Johnson has said it is the nations moral duty to get all kids back to school by September  because of the profound impact on childrens education and wellbeing. He has repeatedly vowed that nothing will get in the way of getting students back in classrooms.The IFS said: “For primary school children, the lockdown has created new inequalities in learning time. “Before the pandemic, there was essentially no dference between the time that children from the poorest and richest households spent on educational activities. “But, during the lockdown, learning time fell by less among primary school children from the richest families than among their less well-off peers. “The end result is that, during the lockdown, the richest students spent  minutes a day longer on educational activities than their peers in the poorest families – an extra % of learning time.”The IFS has said the lockdown widened already entrenched learning gaps.

which will report directly to ministers - will focus specically on getting Britain ready to beat any external health threats that it may face.We have no time to lose, he said in a speech today, thanking health leaders for their service.From today, Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS test and trace will operate under single leadership, reporting to Baroness Dido Harding - the current leader of NHS Track and Trace service - who will undertake a global search for a top leader.Health Secretary Mr Hancock added: “To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all – and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future, we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience.All of the nations health bodies must be brought together to coherently tackle this threat, he insisted.It will be modelled on Germanys Robert Koch Institute, which used an independent agency to take control of the countrys response to the pandemic, and will also take inspiration from South Korea.Mr Hancock said there needs to be more focus on prevention and not just on fixing things when they go wrong - in a side swipe at the now-replaced PHE.The new body will get Britains pandemic preparations ready for winter in case of another bug taking hold of the population.The Health Secretarys worst fear would be a novel flu hitting us right now in the middle of this battle with coronavirus, he warned.And he has every confidence that the new organisation will be world-renowned.Baroness Dido Harding said today:“Combining the UK’s world-class public health talent and infrastructure with the new at-scale response capability of NHS Test and Trace into a single organisation puts us in the strongest position to stop the spread of the virus.She added: with winter ahead, the le-saving work we are doing is more important than ever.A new chief executive – who will be announced soon – will report to both Mr Hancock and the government’s chief scientic officer Sir Patrick Vallance.Mr Hancock wants a high-flyer with experience in the health field and the private sector to run the new body.The announcement comes after reports the body would be ditched were leaked and revealed to the Sundaylast weekend.Ministers have been left frustrated with PHE and the way it operated.Just last week the Government announced a new way of counting deaths after PHE were blamed for over-counting the numbers.At the start of the pandemic a frantic struggle to get hold of PPE led to the increased spread of the virus, and ultimately more deaths.PHEs guidance on what PPE was needed was said to be partly to blame.Officials at the body have also been blasted for spending more time on obesity and getting people to stop eating bad foods rather than focusing on preparing for a possible pandemic.John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said of todays news: “This is very welcome news for taxpayers, who for too long have propped up a nannying quango more interested in dictating diets than preparing for a pandemic.He blasted: “PHE’s woeful performance has signied the problems with our vast quango-state in which money is spent frivolously with little accountability.“The National Institute for Health Protection must prioritise real health emergencies and ensure taxpayers get the maximum possible value for every pound spent.”WHAT a relief blundering and blustering Public Health England is finally for the chop.Since Sars, there have been warnings that further deadly diseases might erupt from China.But instead of preparing Britain for a pandemic by building more testing labs and stocking up on personal protective equipment — measures deemed necessary after a  test run — PHE has spent the last decade banging on about the dangers of fizzy drinks.Even in late February, when Covid was wreaking havoc in mainland Europe, the body responsible for protecting Britain didn’t think it much to worry about.It boasted that with a new “surveillance system” to detect infection spread “ it occurred”, Britain had the “best possible intelligence to protect the public”.We can all see how that turned out.But was the quango humbled by its litany of failure  Not a bit of it.When the pandemic got into full swing, PHE stubbornly opposed German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial labs in providing those tests.Then when it came to sourcing ventilators for patients in intensive care, it made excuses and dragged its feet.We’d like to think that by abolishing this bloated and useless institution, Boris and his ministers are signalling they’re ready to shake up this country’s backwards approach to public health.But our hopes aren’t high: news that mustard and cheese will be banned from daytime TV ads under the Government’s anti-obesity strategy proves just how woefully mixed up our politicians’ priorities have become.Covid has caused mayhem on these islands already.And it’s here to stay for the considerable future.We must never be exposed like this again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He scrapped , downgraded A-level results, which had been standardised because pupils couldnapost sit exams, and reverted to teacher predictions instead. Millions of GCSE results to be handed out this Thursday will be based on teacher predictions too. Itaposs another handbrake turn for a government that has repeatedly defended the indefensible - in the eyes of campaigners anyway - only to back down a few days later. The Prime Minister has repeatedly insisted heaposs proud of his record in dealing with the Covid- pandemic. But the last few months have seen a string of U-turns, changes of heart and shts in the science as Covid- killed more than , people in the UK. Of course, no PM could have dealt with an unprecedented disease with utter perfection. And sometimes a U-turn is a good thing - especiallyit helps students who need it. Even so, there have been a number of moments when the governmentaposs approach came under scrutiny - and buckled under the pressure. They range from cold, hard scientic issues like testing and face coverings to the political heartstrings of free school meals and the bereaved. Here are nine of the biggest U-turns, realignments and changes of heart since the virus hit the UK. . GCSE and A-level downgrades were scrapped  Ministers performed a screeching U-turn over exams grading which plunged thousands of teens into despair. Because students could not sit GCSEs and A-levels due to coronavirus, their grades in England were based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. These are called aposCentre Assessment Gradesapos . But those CAGs were moderated by exam boards first, before they got turned into a final grade. This standardisation was supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from.  Yet a bungled computer algorithm downgraded % of results - , of them by two or more grades. A system to appeal using their mock result then failed to get up and running swtly after A-level results rolled in. That meant thousands were in limbo with no uni place. On August , ministers announced teachersapos predictions would now be used instead of the computer algorithm. But it came too late for some -year-olds to go to the university of their choice. Beleaguered Education Secretary Gavin Williamson failed to guarantee there will be enough capacity for all of them after some already filled up. . Travel quarantine was on, then off, then on  The governmentaposs policy over travel quarantine has been mired in controversy for months. For the first few months of the pandemic, there were no special restrictions on people arriving in the UK from abroad - even when the virus spread across Europe. Then, when the virus became rampant in the UK, scientists said there was little point imposing quarantine on foreign travellers because it wouldnapost make a big dference. Eventually a blanket -day quarantine policy on all arrivals to the UKbegan on June . Those who left their home could face a £, fine. The problem was, that policy enraged airlines and Tory MPs who said it would be a death knell for the industry. And there were questions about enforcement as police forces handed out just one £, fine in the first few weeks. On July , the blanket quarantine order was scrapped in favour of a rolling system where any countries at high risk would have quarantine, and those at low risk would not.The problem withthatwas, risk changes. France, Spain and the Netherlands all had to have quarantine reimposed at short notice after new outbreaks of the virus.That meant Brits faced either a mad dash home before the quarantine took effect, or having to stay in their houses for two weeks. The government refused to offer those travellers Statutory Sick Pay - saying they knew there was a risk when they set off. . Children got free school meals over summer Perhaps the PMaposs biggest U-turn has come not at the hands of the Labour Party, or even from his own backbenchers, but from a Premier League footballer.Millions of Englandaposs poorest children were, for the first time, able to claim free school meal vouchers over the summer holidays following demands from campaigners and -year-old footballer Marcus Rashford.The Manchester United and England star captured hearts with a moving letter describing his own upbringing by a single mum - and urging to PM not to let kids go hungry.Mr Rashfordaposs demands had been ignored by No, but with pressure building among parents and campaigners, Mr Johnson dramatically caved in early June. Just days earlier No had tried to suppress campaignersapos demands by promising a £m pot for councils to help struggling families. But after the footballeraposs campaign began to spread, Downing Street caved. Parents whose children would usually get means-tested free school meals will get a £ supermarket voucher to cover the six weeks of summer. . Face coverings were little use - but now theyaposre compulsory almost everywhere  For months Boris Johnson - and his medical advisors - insisted there was little benefit of covering your face to slow the spread of coronavirus. But the PM slowly came round to the idea as evidence emerged showing they had a small effect, preventing the wearer passing Covid- onto others. For the first time on April  - two months after the first case reached the UK - Boris Johnson admitted: I do think face coverings will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, but also for giving people confidence that they can go back to work. Face coverings were later made mandatory by law on public transport, followed by shops and supermarkets, and other venues such as churches and cinemas. In fairness to the government, the PM could say his scientic advisors had been cool on face coverings for a long time. Even when approved, they said the effect on the virus was weak, and social distancing and hand-washing were still vital. But the government was also accused of ignoring advice. SAGE warned on July : We recommend that guidance for UK hairdressers and barbers should be strengthened to include wearing of face coverings. Yet the government dawdled over the findings for weeks, only enacting a change in policy - forcing hairdressers to wear a full surgical mask, not just a plastic aposvisorapos - on August .  Englandaposs contact-tracing app was designed as a vital tool to tellyouaposve been exposed to someone with Covid-, evenyou donapost know them. But it went from an NHS app thataposd be a key part of the system by mid-May - to an Apple- and Google-run software thataposll be the cherry on top by winter.  On April , the PMaposs official spokesman said the app would be a key part of the surveillance programme going forward.  But the date began to slip to the end of May, then the coming weeks after that, and then winter - as the ditched app only picked up contacts with iPhones % of the time. By the time Boris Johnson said this on May , the government was already clear his pledge didnapost include the app: We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating, and yes, it will be in place by  June. Ministers then tried to downplay the app, with Matt Hancock saying it was the cherry on the cake.On June , the Government then ditched the system behind the NHS coronavirus app and put all its efforts into developing an app based on Google and Appleaposs built-in system.Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted heaposd always backed both horses. Yet a spokesman for his department had told us on May : There is no alternative app. The new app entered trials on the Isle of Wight on August , but still had no confirmed launch date. In May, Boris Johnson U-turned and dropped the Immigration Health Surcharge on migrants who come to work in the NHS or care homes.Thataposs an annual £ charge - rising to £ in October - paid by foreign nationals to cover the cost of their access to the NHS. Less than  hours after defending the unpopular scheme at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, he announced that those coming to the UK to work in the health and care service would be exempt. In June, Mr Johnson pledged to refund any NHS and care staff who had been forced to pay the surcharge, backdated to the date of his announcement. But when that would happen was still unclear. The Prime Minister said he was working to drop the fee for relevant staff “as soon as possible”. . NHS cleanersapos bereaved families can now stay in the UK  Bereaved families of NHS cleaners who die of coronavirus will be allowed to stay in the UK, as part of a major U-turn announced in May.NHS porters, cleaners and social care staff were not included in a Home Office scheme granting families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UKthey die of coronavirus.At the daily press briefing Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the policy was under review. And shortly after the briefing ended, the Home Office announced the decision had been reversed. The scheme will now be available to the families of all NHS support staff, including cleaners and porters - as well as social care workers. The Home Office also confirmed the families of contract staff working in NHS hospitals would also be eligible. . Widespread testing for coronavirus was abandoned - only to eventually start again  The UK abandoned widespread community testing and thorough contact tracing on March  after it became clear the virus was spreading beyond control. It was only reintroduced months later once capacity was high enough - with care home residents not being routinely tested until mid-April. On March , Boris Johnson claimed: We have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan. Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. But on May  the PM admitted: “We did have a test, track and trace operation but unfortunately we did not have the capacity in Public Health England. I think the brutal reality is this country didn’t learn the lessons of Sars or Mers and we didn’t have a test operation ready to go on the scale that we needed.” At the time community testing was dropped, Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, claimed it was not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward. But she, too, later accepted the nation would have taken a dferent pathmore tests were available. She added: If we had unlimited capacity, and the ongoing support beyond that, then we perhaps would choose a slightly dferent approach. Public Health England has since had blame pointed at it over the policy. .

The Health Secretary said one of the big lessons from coronavirus is that partnering up with corporate giants is the best way through. Launching a new National Institute for Health Protection, Mr Hancock added the idea of a split between public and private sector is for the birds. The comments prompted fury from campaigners who have criticised the scale of outsourcing during the coronavirus pandemic. Labour said more dogmatic Tory privatisation isn’t the answer while anti-privatisation group We Own It said Mr Hancockaposs comments beggar belief. Several contracts for supplying PPE for example have been handed out without full competition, under urgency rules. Some have gone to firms which campaigners say have little experience in the field.  There has also been criticism after much of the work of the NHS Test and Trace programme was outsourced to private firms Serco and Sitel. More than a quarter of Covid sufferersapos close contacts arenapost reached by the scheme. The national outsourcersapos work was recently cut back in favour of giving local public health teams more of a say over contact tracing. However, Mr Hancock today said the use of private firms in the coronavirus response had been vital and suggested it will carry on in the future. Responding to a question from drug giant Pfizer about the role for private sector firms in the future, he said: The truth is we couldn’t have done this without the private sector. We couldn’t have expanded testing in the way that we did. We couldn’t have expanded contact tracing in the way that we did.  We couldn’t have come up with the treatment - the one treatment that worked, that wasn’t developed by a government, it was developed by a private company working within a government framework. The best work I’ve seen brings the contribution of the private sector, of government, and of government institutions like the NHS. So I think that’s been one of the big learnings. This idea that there’s a ide is for the birds, and partnership is the best way through. So for a company like Pfizer, the truth is the single best thing you can do is make sure your vaccine works and get it up to speed as quickly as possible. And there’s a classic example. He added: My message to everyone in the private sector is - join us in the mission. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: Tory Ministers have thrown millions of taxpayers at private corporations under the cover of this pandemic. The result is a tracing system failing to trace and a testing system not turning round test results in  hours as pledged.They promised us a world beating system but today they gave us desperate blame shting. More dogmatic Tory privatisation isn’t the answer. We need well funded locally led public health experts hunting down the virus and helping those who need it to isolate. Cat Hobbs, Director of We Own It said: It beggars belief that Matt Hancock is going out of his way to thank the private sector for its role in this pandemic. The reality is that privatising the coronavirus response has been a disaster. Itaposs weakened the NHSaposs efforts and it has put lives at risk. Rather than praising private companies and continuing to give them bucketloads of cash, Matt Hancock must properly fund the NHS - our public health service. It came as Mr Hancock confirmed Public Health England will be scrapped - and the change will begin today.The Health Secretary announced the drastic changes with immediate effect despite anger at him for doing so in the middle of a pandemic.PHE, which was responsible for vital coronavirus testing and research, will have its pandemic work merged with that of the much-criticised NHS Test and Trace programme.A new organisation called the National Institute for Health Protection will oversee what is now PHEaposs pandemic work - led by Tory peer and David Cameronaposs pal Dido Harding. Meanwhile PHEaposs work on obesity, addiction and other vital public health issues will be handed to councils - whoaposve had public health budgets slashed - and across the NHS, including GPs and pharmacies. But Mr Hancock risks new fury after admitting there is not yet a plan for who will oversee the new public health work.

Blundering Gavin Williamson last night scrapped all , downgraded A-level results in England and let students use their teachersapos predicted grades instead. But many universities had already rejected students who had an offer and taken other applicants through Clearing instead. According to The Times, , pupils missed out on their first choices last week and have already signed up to other universities. Another , were planning to appeal. The Education Secretary - who marked the moment by posing in his office with a whip - last night lted the cap on the number of students that can go to each university. Yet uni chiefs warned that wasnapost enough to solve capacity problems in accommodation and lecture halls - especially in the age of social distancing.What do you think of how grades have been decided and this change  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.Questioned by the Mirror last night, Mr Williamson failed to guarantee any new funding for stricken unis to boost space. Instead he told us: “We’re working with universities on capacity. We expect universities to honour their pledges. “We’re also setting up a task force with the university sector to work with them, to get through some of the issues and challenges that they’re facing.” Mr Williamson also refused to guarantee that every student will get the uni place that was offered to them - even where theyaposve now got the right grades. Passing the buck to unis, he said: “We’re already working very closely with the university sector to make sure that we do everything we can do to build as much capacity in there. “We expect universities to be flexible, we expect them to go above and beyond, to honour those commitments. There was fury after the exam regulator’s algorithm downgraded % of teachers’ predictions for A-level results – with pupils in poorer areas the worst affected.  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has tried to sht the blame on to regulator Ofqual - claiming he only realised there were problems on Saturday. That is despite the fact he was being warned about the problems for months, and saw very similar problems play out in Scotland a week earlier. Ministers were finally forced into another screeching U-turn last night to quell fury over the debacle. The Tories caved in to demands to use teachers’ predictions for A-level, AS-level and GCSE results, instead of the bungled computer formula. A solution for BTecs is still being worked out, with thousands of those students still in limbo.The Cabinet minister apologised for the distress caused by the policy - which was meant to prevent aposgrade inflationapos for pupils who could not sit exams because of coronavirus.But questions remain unanswered for universities. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, called for urgent clarication from the Government on a number of crucial issues. He said the change at this late stage will cause challenges for capacity and staffing as he called on ministers to step up and support universities. Paul Whiteman, of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The big question remains as to why this decision has taken so long, as it may already be too late for some students who have missed out on their first choice of university and course.” University and College Union chief Jo Grady said: “The political incompetence is unforgivable and there are still many questions to be answered.” Boris Johnson has refused to cut short his holiday in Scotland to deal with the crisis - and Mr Williamson has refused to resign. Writing for the Mirror, Keir Starmer said the Tories are guilty of a string of failings during the pandemic.He said: “At a time of national emergency, this is no way to run a country.” The U-turn came after days of pressure and protests including students outside Mr Williamson’s Staffordshire constituency office on Monday. Students  slammed the Government for giving them days of stress before U-turning on grades. Thomas Jukes, , from Great Barr in Birmingham, wants to study medicine at the University of Birmingham and questioned why the “rubbish algorithm” was used in the first place. He said: “I’m much more pleased now I have got my centre-assessed grades. It’s just dependent now on whether my places have been held.” Hatice Dogus, , of Warrington, Cheshire, had been predicted grades of sevens, sixes and fives in her GCSEs and had been offered a place at sixth form based on those predictions.  She said: “Teachers have known me for five years and have seen all the hard work I have put in... whereas the computer would have judged me based on my mock exams and my postcode. I needed the grades I was predicted.” Reagan McNamara, , of Newton-Le-Willows, Merseyside, said: “If they were going off the algorithm I would have failed all of my results, there is no doubt in my mind after seeing the mess the Government made of A-level results.  “I feel a lot better now because my place in college is safe.” Nina Bunting-Mitcham, , who told schools minister Nick Gibb “you’ve ruined my le” after being given three D grades in the A-level results fiasco, is still unsure whether she will be offered the course she wanted. But Nina, of Thorney, Cambs, now has teacher-assessed grades of ABB and said: “I’ve gone from almost wanting to just stop living any more to feeling absolutely ecstatic.”  How grading system will workWhere teachers’ predictions for marks are better thanthe algorithm, pupils will be switched to the higher grade. If the computer system gives them a better mark than their schools believed they would achieve, the higher grade willbe retained by students.This effectively gives pupils a “double lock” on A-levels, AS levels and GCSEs. No appeals are needed. Grades will be automatically hiked.  This spares the Government another row with unions, with teachers able to concentrate on preparing schools to start the new academic year next month. That aspect was specically highlighted by Ofqual in its explanation for the switch. Students unhappy with the marks predicted by teachers can appeal their “centre assessment grades”. The criteria are yet to be released. Gavin Williamson said this could happenpupils suspect teacher “bias or discrimination”. Toriesapos biggest U-turn gaffes The Tories have repeatedly U-turned during the Covid- pandemic. Here are some of their biggest gaffes. ■ Mass testing started, then stopped, then started again. ■ Ministers repeatedly said there was little benefit to face masks – then ordered them to be worn in shops, takeaways and on public transport.

Now she believes it could have saved her le.At just  years old, she was young, fit and – she believed – in perfect health when she collapsed at her home in Essex in May. “I’ve always been into exercise as a way to keep fit and in shape,” says Loren, who worked as a teaching assistant before her travels. ”I was cooling down after doing my usual routine when I felt a sudden pain in my neck. It was very odd – like a big click inside my body. “My first thought was that I’d pulled a muscle, so I went to sit down. But a couple of minutes later, my boyfriend said I was looking a bit odd and passed me a glass of water. “Next thing, I collapsed. I was unconscious for  minutes – and when I started to come round, I couldn’t see.” What Loren thought was a muscle strain was in fact a stroke in the basilar artery of her brain – one of the most potentially devastating types of stroke, fatal in as many as % of cases. For those who survive, these strokes can leave patients with severe disabilities, including head-to-toe paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Yet miraculously, thanks to prompt and expert treatment, Loren is one of the lucky few who escape completely unscathed. Now she believes she’s alive and well because the coronavirus outbreak forced her to curtail her travels.  She was in Thailand, half-way through a two-year trip around the world with her boyfriend Harry Rodell, also , when the pandemic struck, forcing the couple toto the UK. They went into lockdown with Loren’s family in Chadwell St Mary, Essex and were there when Loren collapsed on May . “The paramedics told me that I’d probably had a stroke,” she says. “I thought that sounded pretty crazy, given my age and good health. I thought strokes were something that only happened to old people.”  While most strokes do occur in people aged over , the Stroke Association points out that they can happen at any age, even in babies. Loren was rushed to her nearest hospital in Basildon, where she was treated with clot-busting drugs, then transferred to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where she underwent a throm-bectomy. The procedure has to be carried out within hours of the stroke and involves inserting a small mesh hook into an artery in the groin, moving it up to the brain and pulling out the blood clot. It only works in a small proportion of stroke cases, but can have a big impact on reducing disability. As a fairly new “game-changing” procedure, it is currently not widely available. Had Loren not been in the UK when she had her stroke, it’s unlikely she would have been able to have the treatment. “The date I had my stroke, I should have been in Cambodia,” says Loren. “There, I wouldn’t have had speedy access to the amazing medical care that we tend to take for granted in this country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus updates lockdown parts north","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES: Matt Hancock says Public Health England to be scrapped todayThe Health Secretary announced the drastic changes with the public health body being scrapped with immediate effect - in the middle of a pandemicShareByNeil MurphyUpdated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Husband and we Chloe-Anne Davey, , and Adam Davey, , from Ilkeston, had booked a £, holiday for them and their three children, eight, six, and four. They were set to spend two weeks at Bideford Bay Holiday Park in Devon, which is a Parkdean resort. They say they had to buy their own cleaning products - and left the resort a day early - due to the aposhorribleapos condition of the caravan. Mouldy mattresses, badly kept showers and a broken fridge greeted the family on August . Full-time mum Mrs Davey told Nottinghamshire Live: This holiday was really important to us as a family due to the fact we had a lot going on. We lost a baby last September and we have both suffered with depression. The holiday was a time to spend as a family and was super special for us. The past year has been heartbreaking.  But the family said the problems began as soon as they arrived at the door of their static caravan. When we first arrived, [there was a] strong smell of mould. There was also general dampness. The shower was mouldy and the fridge was broken. My four-year-old is asthmatic and was sleeping on the sofa bed. It was full of black mould. It was vile.  She said they immediately complained and were told it was because the caravan was under trees. An upgrade was agreed but they had to wait a week before moving into it as there was no availability until then. Mrs Davey added: We do not think the cleaning measures were taken to a professional standard, let alone a Covid standard. During a pandemic, the hygiene should be topnotch.  They moved into the second caravan only to find other problems, including no frying pans, bins for their rubbish and aposthick black grimeapos on the doors and shower. Despite making complaints, and leaving a day early due to the alleged state of the caravan, they still have not received an apology from the company. It has ruined our holiday, said Mrs Davey.

A turning point came when, she says, her boyfriend mocked her size  body. Angela, also mum to April, seven, decided enough was enough and ditched him, along with her bad habits. She swapped takeaways for lean meat and fish and now boxes six times a week. Just  months later, Angela is a confident size . She said: “I’m so proud of myself and when I look in the mirror I struggle to believe it’s actually me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Regarding Covid-, it’s worth ­remembering because any contact with mother nature, even through a window, is good for our wellbeing. If you can add in some mindfulnessby stopping to listen to birdsong, examining the petals of a flower or noticing the dappled sunlight on grass, the benefits are even greater. Perhaps surprisingly, researchers found that it’s the people who usually feel little connection to nature who stand to benefit the most. I refer you to the University of Derby’s five-year review of the Wildle Trusts’  Days Wild challenge, where people commit to exploring nature every day for  days. A survey of , people showed that taking part in the challenge boosted their health by an average of %.  Professor Miles Richardson, of the University of Derby, said the evaluation “shows the positive power of simple engagement with nature”. He added: “We were thrilled to see that the ­signicant increases in people’s health and happiness were still felt even two months after the  Days Wild ­challenge was over. “The Wildle Trusts have shown the importance of doing simple things to enjoy everyday nature and that it can bring considerable benefits. “What really stood out was how the people who didn’t feel a connection with nature at the outset were the ones who benefitted most from taking part in  Days Wild.” "},{"url":null,"title":"my life instagram model really","story":"NewsMy le as an Instagram model is really tough and Im sick of people saying its easyEXCLUSIVE: Jenny Mosienko has been an Instagram model for  years, explains that while she loves the job and the benefits it brings, its also a lot of hard work and its definitely not for everyoneShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video influencer-jenny-mosienko-shows-intense-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

But while many donapost give the profession much credit, some of the biggest stars have made a fortune and become huge celebrities from sharing their lives on social media. Instagram model Jenny Mosienko, who boasts .million followers, believes people should give her industry more credit and says she has a gruelling working day. She tells : Lots of people assume that being an Instagram model is a piece of cake, that we just take selfies in our bedrooms and post paid ads, but thereaposs a lot more to it than that. No, I donapost do catwalks or editorial shoots, but I have to carefully curate my own content, plan ahead, I work with brands to support their marketing and PR strategies, engage with my audience, attend international trips, work with fellow influencers from PINKKISS and accept that I am in full control of my career. Weaposre not traditional models but the world has transformed and Instagram models enjoy equally complex, fulfilling careers in a medium that compliments this modern era - itaposs definitely not easy. Jenny has been an Instagram model for  years and makes her money through collaborations and photo shoots. Describing her day-to-day, she says: My days constantly change. I am very committed to my fitness though so Iaposll usually wake up, enjoy breakfast and do a workout. If Iaposm at home Iaposll then take some photos and create content, engage with my followers and work on any current projects.  I love spending time with my friends and family too, itaposs important to find balance. Over the years Jenny has been sent a number of negative messages from strangers over the years putting her down for what she does. She explains: People assume that because we open ourselves up to the world online weaposre not affected by trolling - this isnapost true, weaposre only human. A lot of the time these comments are from men, they tend to leave sexist remarks on my posts and think that because Iaposm wearing a bikini thataposs justiable. This is something I of course want to change but on a day to day basis I try to not let it affect me - trolls are persistent but positivity will always outshine negative comments.  Some people think that weaposre all shallow. The stereotype surrounding Instagram models often paints us as dumb and completely image-focused. As a model I of course take a pride in my appearance but Iaposm also a businesswoman and Instagram is a mere screenshot of my le - thereaposs a lot more to me than my le as a model. But she explains that the people who really matter, including her family and friends, have been a huge support. She said: My friends and family are completely supportive. Theyaposve seen how much happiness it brings me, that I can earn a living through Instagram influencing and ultimately thereaposs no harm in it.  They think Iaposm lucky to be able to enjoy such a unique career. Jenny also says that people rarely understand what it takes to be an Instagram model, including hours of hard work before the scenes. She said: People also assume that I work for less than an hour a day, that I snap a couple of photos and then Iaposm done - this couldnapost be further from the truth. Being an Instagram model is a full-time job. Shoots are long, planning takes time, collaborations need organising - itaposs not something you can just breeze into, it takes lots of hard work and commitment. But while itaposs hard work, Jenny said there are lots of benefits to the job - and she loves every minute.  She said: I love the independence that being an Instagram model provides - I choose the photos I post, who I work with and when I work. It also allows me to travel the world with like-minded, talented, creative people. As an ambassador for PINKKISS for example I travel to countries like Jamaica for shoots and networking events - yes, we network too!

The story goes that Brad Pitt’s parents, Jane and William, have allegedly not seen their grandchildren since , because of a rt with their mother Angelina Jolie. For my kids, a spell that long away from such influential figures in their lives would be unacceptable. When my better half and I next take a few days off, we will have no compunction about trusting our little ones with their grandparents. The kids will demand it and rightly so. New research showing half of all mothers and fathers have fallen out with their own parents over the grandkids is symptomatic of the breakdown in our society. You only have to look at some of the areas over which they are fighting – discipline, manners, eating habits and screen time. It spooks me to consider just how old I sound saying this, but take a ride on a bus sometime – particularly before or after school – and observe the behaviour of some of today’s youngsters, particularly towards the older generation.  Listen to the language, observe the lack of respect. Then compare it to the way you treated your elders growing up. Consider how many of those kids would benefit from the traditional values on which we were raised. Yes, of course we want to be progressive in the way we bring up our kids. Yetwe are honest we’d all admit to bones of contention with our parents over which they were ultimately proven right. Nor would they approve of the way that iPads and iPhones are used as virtual babysitters now. Studies have shown, too, that extended periods of time with grandparents increases a child’s emotional intelligence and positively affects the way that they relate to their elders. It extends their vocabulary with grandparents taking the time to play and read books while parents are busy working. Time with the elders leaves a child more likely to understand their family history with grandparents able to provide context and perspective. Our youngsters have also learned skill-sets such as crafting, baking and basic DIY.

Scobie claims that Meghan kept trying to book in a day to do the trial run, but struggled to pin Angela down.“He called his grandmother and said, ‘I don’t know what the hell is going on. But this woman needs to make this work for my future we’”, Scobie said. However, that account has now been strenuously denied by a source close to the Sussexes. A source close to the Duke of Sussex has branded the allegations as completely ridiculous and totally untrue.The source told the: “The Queen is probably the person he respects and values most in the world.” Speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Scobie explains that an initial meeting where Meghan picked her tiara was actually a huge success. He said: The tiara selection went wonderfully. The Queen was very happy, Meghan was very happy. In fact Meghanaposs words when that story came out were aposhow sad, I love my tiaraapos.  The drama took place afterwards, when Meghan wanted to try that tiara on with her hair stylist, because there is a lot of tech that goes into this. They had to do an experiment with that before the wedding day. The hairstylist came in from overseas, there was an appointment at Buckingham Palace, but nobody was there. We can see kind of see now where this aposwhat Meghan wants, Meghan getsapos narrative came from.  He goes on: Harry felt that there were those within the institution that would stop at nothing to at the very least to make Meghan’s le dficult. “Meghan didn’t get to try the tiara on again until a few days before the wedding.” Meghan wore Queen Maryaposs stunning bandeau tiara, which is covered in precious diamonds.

The number of infections continues to rise across the country, with a shocking , new cases reported over the weekend. The total number of people infected with coronavirus in the country currently stands at ,. The Foreign Office also advises against travelling to Spain or the Islands, meaning many holidaymakers have been forced to cancel their trips. Now Estel has told about her experience of flying to the popular holiday destination as travel restrictions continue.She wrote for Bristol Live about her unusual holiday - and the strict measures in place across Spain.Email us about your holiday experiences, good or bad, at webtravel@trinitymirror Flying to Barcelona Estel flies back to Barcelona regularly to visit her friends and family since she moved to the UK back in . She said: Visiting in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic wasnapost an easy decision for me to make but, not having seen my family since Christmas, I was anxious to travel in case more restrictions come into force in the near future, rather than less. Although the cities incredible culture, delicious food and stunning beaches are a huge attraction for many, Estel says Barcelona looked very dferent when she arrived.  She said: I knew the experience would be very dferent to what I am used to, but I wasnapost expecting to see as many disparities with the way the pandemic is being handled in the UK. As soon as she arrived, her mum made sure she put her face masks on as there are strict requirements requiring everyone over the age of six years old to wear one on public transport and in many public spaces. Many people wear their masks below the chin - and only put them on when they enter somewhere or it is impossible to social distance. Estel said it was rare to see someone not carrying one. Socialising Estel says the streets of her hometown, which is just outside Barcelona, were busy with people going on about their day. Groups of elderly people could be seen having chats on benches while outside seating areas were busy with people having drinks.  But there is one big particular issue for Spanish people, Estel admits.  She said: I thought the coronavirus crisis may force cultural changes back home, with touching, hugging and kissing no longer being a key part of the way people interact with each other. Apparently, that was the case earlier on in the year but I got the impression the craving for human contact is becoming harder to resist. Estel said she swerved a trip to the beach or swimming pool with her friends, in an effort to keep her family safe. And many people are looking to do the same - despite the scorching temperatures.  In Marbella, beaches are closed between .pm and am as part of new safety restrictions. Marbella Council announced the new restrictions on August  following  outbreaks of coronavirus across the Costal del Sol. Coronavirus  Contact tracing has previously been criticised - with British media reporting it was falling short across Spain. But Estel says the government are focusing on other aspects - including social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing. But unlike in the UK, she says wasnapost asked for her contact details while eating in restaurants and cafes. But in Spain, tracers are responsible for tracking the movements of anyone who has tested positive and alerting people who have been in close contact. They are then askedthey have symptoms and must self-isolate for  days. Shopping Estel says that shopping for clothes is normally a highlight of any trip back home. But the experience was very dferent this time - as she was worried about trying clothes on.

In her demonstration, the raging Queensland parent claims that, when submerged in cold water, some of the doll’s features change. For example, she says, the word “caution” appears on its underwear, which appears to turn into tape or bandages. Shackles also apparently emerge on the doll’s wrists. “We need to stand up for our children,” she says in the video. “What’s going on right underneath our noses... our children are being groomed for pedophilia, it’s as simple as that.  “As a mum, I am fuming and so ... livid right now that my daughter has these toys in our house and I knew nothing about it.” Another doll emerges from submerged water apparently with an anchor tattoo on its leg. “This is the most disgusting thing that I have come across,” Worsfold said. “This is toys that are being given to our kids... and we’re buying them innocently, thinking ‘oh they’re just going to have a whole lot of fun with these little mini girl toy’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tormented life worlds loneliest elephant","story":"NewsTormented le of worlds loneliest elephant kept in chains for  yearsKaavan the Asian elephant had inspired an international effort to have him moved from his cramped home at the Maraghazar Zoo in Pakistan’s capital, IslamabadShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video worlds-loneliest-elephant-who-kept-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Eight years ago the bull elephant, who has spent his le at the Maraghazar Zoo in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, was left totally alone when his companion, Saheli, died. The two elephants had shared an enclosure since , but in  Kaavan was left all alone. After it emerged Kaavan was reportedly tied up at all times, hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition for him to be given a new home, where he would be better cared for. It was backed by some of the biggest stars on the planet, like Cher, horried at what was happening to the elephant. Four years ago, zoo bosses insisted Kaavan was no longer chained but his long-awaited new mate never arrived and the elephant was forced to spend all his time alone. They claimed he had only been chained when he suffered violent outbursts but there were also disturbing reports that Kaavan had been beaten to try to control his temper. To make matters worse, Kaavan was confined to a pen just m by m with little shelter, which meant he had no respite from the baking sun. Temperatures can reach a stling C in Islamabad and there was no shade for the lonely elephant. Spending so long alone and with nothing to occupy him is believed to have had a devastating impact on Kaavan - and in the years after his mate died he showed increasing signs of mental distress and depression. Safwan Shahab Ahmad, the vice chairman of Pakistan Wildle Foundation who has studied the elephant since the s, said behaviour like head bobbing demonstrated “a kind of mental illness”. The elephant was regularly said to be seen swaying and bobbing his head in his enclosure. Safwan added: Give Kaavan deep bushes and articial showering and you will see him enjoying the environment. Other experts feared thatKaavanaposs living situation did not change it would dramatically shorten his le span. Zookeeper Jalal-ud-din Ahmad added: “Bring a female elephant and you will see very positive changes in Kaavan.” But for eight, long years, Kaavan only had his keepers for company and not one of his own kind. Heartbreakingly, even his keeper, Mohammad Jalal, said: I have hardly seen him happy. Last year, both local and international animal rights groups launched a bid to have the elephant re-homed in a suitable sanctuary after his years of suffering. Finally, in May this year the Islamabad High Court ordered wildle officials to launch a consultation with Sri Lanka, where the elephant came from, to find him a suitable sanctuary. And one person who was over the moon was music legend, Cher. She said at the time: This is one of the greatest moments of my le. However, the Capital Development Authority, the local agency in charge of managing the zoo, claimed that every possible step was being taken tpo ensure Kaavanaposs welfare. It did not say how or what was being done. Now, Kaavan has finally been allowed a chance at a new le after he was moved to the Lekaposs sanctuary in Cambodia, where conditions are expected to be more suited to him and where he will have other elephants for company. Government minister Malik Amin Aslam said authorities would free this elephant with a kind heart, and will ensure that he lives a happy le.

I realise they are not the most liked creatures in Dundee but it wasn#t right what he was doing.#I started to record it after I clocked him kicking it.

However, the scientic evidence is less clear when it comes to older schoolchildren.Nicola Sturgeon has pledged guidance on whether older pupils will be required to wear face coverings inside schools will be kept under review, and the Scottish Government has acknowledged the situation is less clear for secondary-age youngsters.The new rules introduced to school campuses appear to reflect the possibility that older children could be at a higher risk of catching and spreading the virus.Officials in Scotland took the view that #the balance of risk is now strongly in favour of children and young people ing to school full-time# and decided to push forward with the reopening of classrooms this month.The Scottish Government had originally anticipated a #blended model# of learning where children split their time at home and at school but scrapped these plans amid pressure from parents and opposition parties.While all children are now expected to , dferent rules will apply for dferent age groups.

A huge shock.#I was thinking of how warm it was and, although I know this isn#t the same as the emergency services# work at all, how I often get dehydrated at jobs.#I spoke with a friend who knew someone at Scotmid and they were so fast in getting together some food and drinks.#The -year-old added: “We are a close knit community and when this tragic event happened, many people were keen to help.#It was a small thing to do but I think it made a big dference to them.#I’d like to say a big thank you to Scotmid for responding so quickly and of course, to everyone on site that day, who worked so tirelessly to help get passengers off the train safely.#Elaine Arthur, senior team leader at Scotmid in Laurencekirk, added: “As a retailer based at the heart of those communities we serve, we were only too happy to get involved and help out.#When Louise approached us, we responded immediately, providing ious snacks and drinks to keep the energy and spirits up of all those working on the site.#The derailment was an awful event and our thoughts go out to those families and iniduals affected.”Later in the day, Mrs Maclom got in touch with the Alma in Laurencekirk # who provided nearly  curries for emergency services workers.Many other food outlets also got involved in doing what they could for those affected by the crash.Cool Gourmet, in Stonehaven, was asked to do catering for the emergency services workers and did so #without hesitation.#Other local businesses to help included McHardy#s the Butcher, Westeron Farmers, The Villa and Goodfellows."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/08/Cove-Rangers-F.C.-940x456.jpg ","title":"north east football clubs team up to help those in need during covid 19 pandemic","story":"Football clubs from across the north-east have teamed up to support the region#s most vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic.Aberdeen FC Community Trusthas won acclaim for its Still Standing Free campaign, which has helped thousands of people across the north-east during the Covid- crisis.At the start of the summer holidays, the trust teamed up with four other clubs # Cove Rangers, Inverurie Locos, Westdyke Community Club and Aberdeen FC Women # in a bid to make even more of a dference.So far, volunteers, players and staff have handed out more than , food parcels and other essentials.AFC Community Trust chief executive Liz Bowie said: “It has been absolutely fantastic to see the football community pull together to provide invaluable support across the area at a time when vulnerable families and their children needed it most.“The drivers who deliver the packages have told us some really heart-warming stories of some of the reactions they’ve had from recipients, especially from the children, and that’s made it all worthwhile.“Sport, football in particular, is a great leveller which brings together people of all ages and from all walks of le and the Still Standing Free campaign has demonstrated what can be achieved through people working enthusiastically as a team.”Still Standing Free has been delivered by AFCCT in partnership with Cfine, and received support from organisations such as the Arthur M Blank Family Foundation and the Lord Provost#s Trust.Cove, Locos, Westdyke and AFC Women got on board with the scheme to identy those in their own communities who would benefit from deliveries of food.The trust estimates the efforts of the four clubs have resulted in an additional , people receiving support.In total, more than , food drops have taken place, with , people benefiting.As well as food deliveries, more than , calls have been made to check on the welfare of residents in the north-east.As childrento school, the current phase of the campaign is set to come to an end # but plans are already being put in place for a legacy programme to continue the scheme.Liz said: “We recognise the vital part the campaign has had in alleviating food poverty during this dficult period, but the reality is that families will continue to need help in the uncertain times ahead.“We are in discussions with partners to look at dferent approaches to provide this support within local community settings. We haven’t finalised our plans yet, but options include ideas like food pantries.“We are so incredibly grateful to the financial support we have received and what it has enabled to date and will in the future.#Besides the food initiatives, we are excited about moving forward with some new programmes centred around our key trust activities – education, healthy communities and football.“We look forward to expanding our MINDSET programme which supports young people’s mental health in a highly interactive and fun setting.  Such support will be increasingly important in light of the predicted increase in mental health issues post Covid-.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Nursing students worked on extended placements, allied health professionals including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiography students stepped into health care support worker roles until they were able to work as fast track graduates and final year medical students graduated early to work as interim foundation year one doctors.#Students signicant contribution and rapid adaption to the new circumstances is sincerely appreciated.June Brown, interim deputy director of nursing, added: #A core role for NHS Grampian is being an education provider, and one we consider of great importance.#We very quickly recognised as we started to plan for the remobilisation phase of Covid- that preparing for the new academic year and students ing to NHS Grampian was a very high priority.#Without students we have no future workforce so it was important for us to prioritise working to get this right.#Our students will be ing to this environment of unpredictability and change and will not have experienced working clinically yet in this new world.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPeople remarked on the freshness of the air.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice.

No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus.

Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the

bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to

The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Add to that the tsunami of appeals that secondary teachers face having to process and there is a risk that the pressure will become overwhelming.One way to fix this would be to revert to teachersrsquo estimates for grades which have been reduced. This would show pupils in the most disadvantaged areas, who were twice as likely to have results downgraded, that their hard work will ensure they have the same chances as those in more affluent areas.I hope that is the course John Swinney takes this week. But evenhe does finally do the right thing, this is only the latest in a series of catastrophic errors made during his time as Education Secretary.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea. To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

This will be particularly important post-Covid when the area is likely to be suffering alongside many others from store closures and reduced footfall.ldquoOn the subject of the introduction of a mph zone for the town, this too is to be welcomed. What puzzles us is how the boundaries of the zone were decided upon because some do seem to defy logic. For example, the residents of Inveresk have been crying out for a mph limit and yet the new mph zone comes to an end at the entry point to the village."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes-paid-north-berwicks-resilience-volunteers","story":"In mid-March, the community council launched its action plan, which was operated by a sub-group led by member Sue Northrop, and also comprising chairman Judy Lockhart and secretary Kathryn Smith.It then put out an appeal for volunteers for its resilience team and received hundreds of responses.A Facebook page was set up that kept both volunteers and residents informed, alongside a website with important information.Over the next four months, volunteers assisted in tasks such as picking up prescriptions, delivering shopping, dog walking, cooking meals and buying food.The resilience group also bought and delivered hundreds of copies of the Courier to residents.A Street Links scheme was set up that linked neighbours together and let them know their single point of contact should it be needed a fundraising page was also started which attracted thousands of pounds in donations.Several schemes were also run such as a group of stitchers making masks, a games and jigsaw exchange, and computer tablets being given to vulnerable groups.Judy said: ldquoOn behalf of North Berwick Community Council, I would like to thank everyone who has helped over the past four months volunteering and supportingNorth Berwick Resilience Group.ldquoWe would particularly like to thank the Community Emergency Response Team.

However, some of our work will continue, for example the stitchers will continue making masks and we hope to widen our technology project which saw computer tablets being given to vulnerable groups.ldquoWe believe that the work we have begun through the pandemic has helped form a more inclusive North Berwick and we will work to maintain and strengthen that.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Yoursquod expect that as a travel writer. It feels strange though. Very strange. As strange as the rabbit hole Irsquove burrowed down since flying back from Italy as Covid- hit there in February. Irsquove not been in a hotel or a restaurant. Not even a shop. Irsquove not driven anywhere. My world has become startlingly small, as it has for many of us. But now Irsquom setting off to explore the new normal as Scottish tourism tentatively s. In my sights are a family-run hotel, a horse truck conversion, a cruise ship that isnrsquot a cruise ship and Scotlandrsquos most famous resort hotel.The physical effort of getting in the car is not great. Itrsquos more metaphysical issues Irsquom struggling with. Should I even be travelling when there are new infections daily, people are still in hospital and, yes, people are still dying  Is it insensitive, distasteful even  A friend soothes that people are going to travel anyway, so at least Irsquom trying to offer an insight into what itrsquos like. Another friend just bluntly declares itrsquos my job so get on with it like everyone .I wonrsquot just be going anywhere. Broadcasting on BBC Radio recently I was reminded of how dferent the situation and sentiment is in some of Scotlandrsquos island communities. Understandable when NHS Western Isles are the only health board in Scotland to record zero Covid- deaths to date. Irsquom acutely aware of our safety too as Irsquom sitting by my we Jenny with our two young daughters in the back. Wersquove multiple face masks and a gooey hand gel lake decanted into ious vessels. I spend the first half hour reminding the girls of the Scottish Governmentrsquos snappy FACTS campaign. Snappy, but I still need to look up what the lsquoCrsquo stands for.First up is Loch Melfort Hotel, a real escape out on the wild and wildly beautul west coast of Argyll. The owner is a high heidjin in Visit Scotland so they should get it right. Over a physically distanced coffee with the isles of Luing, Jura and Scarba sparkling behind him Calum Ross explains: ldquoItrsquos a real balance between making sure we take all the essential public health precautions, while at the same time ensuring itrsquos still an enjoyable and rewarding experience for our guests.Reassuringly Loch Melfort do get it right. They have clear signage branded with an image of Dougal, one of the Highland Cows who grazes happily outside, oblivious to the pandemic swirling around. lsquoDougal saysrsquo signs remind us to socially distance and to use the gel dispenser as we enter the lobby. He pops up again in our room helping us to find the hotel directory online.In the restaurant staff wear visors and dispense sanitised plastic menus. I momentarily miss a crisp white linen tablecloth, but this is soon forgotten when my Argyll beef fillet topped with local langoustines sweeps in. The girls and Jenny are tucking in too. I see Dougal outside. He seems to approve. As do our fellow diners. Itrsquos good to be with strangers smiling and laughing rather than just seeing our neighbours clap awkwardly on a Thursday.Next up wersquore off on a cruise ship. The Foreign Office almost stymies us by bringing in a blanket ban on cruise travel just before we sail. Fortunately wee Red Moon is husband and we run and takes just four passengers so our nuclear family is a charter rather than a cruise.Scott and Mary welcome us aboard like old friends, just ones who donrsquot shake hands anymore. Their trim, beautully fitted out marine hotel is equipped with a flotilla of hand gel and they explain theyrsquoll clean our bathroom daily, just not our cabins. They stress the use of gel going ashore and also that we must stay away from Maryrsquos cooking space in the galley.We spend four days puttering around close to shore after deciding to avoid inhabited isles. We ramble around rugged Bernera, where once St Columba preached under a giant yew tree. It doesnrsquot look like anyone has visited since. We also take the tender ashore in an overnight anchorage at Loch arsquo Choire in Morvern. We do stumble upon locals, but they are red deer and soaring golden eagles. Just off Lismore we are graced with a sea eagle and dolphins.Then it happens. On sleepy Balnagowan we presume the islandrsquos owner is not around. We row ashore to avoid disrupting the local seal colony, who are intrigued by our landing party and send scouts over to investigate. I ramble off alone, mindful of protective nesting seabirds and there she is. The lady owner of Balnagowan. I immediately spill into apologetic mode, but she stops me in my tracks with a beaming smile saying how happy she is just to see someone. Lockdown must have been very lonely on Balnagowan.Back on land we gun east for Perthshire and the cosseted world of Gleneagles. But can you achieve world-class five-star luxury in the time of Covid- with safety precautions in and swimming pools and spas out  The answer is a resounding yes. On arrival no one seems to mind the lack of valet parking as they shimmy respectfully through the grand racing green lobby sticking to the left as signs advise. We sanitise ourselves before meeting the receptionist, whose smile beams through her mask and screen. Again these measures reassure rather than concern.The swimming pools may be off bounds, but impressively the spa has managed to re-open, offering limited virus sensitive treatments such as a face down massages. All the restaurants have re-opened. We savour the excellent Indian dishes of the Dormy , the swish new Birnam Brasserie, with its fish and meat grills, and that grand old world dame, the Strathearn.At the Strathearn theyrsquove retained the white linen tablecloths, though they politely inform us we have to look after our own napkins ndash treacherous waters for a serial napkin dropper like myself. Once we settle in we soon forget about their visors and the sommelier is just the ever helpful sommelier and the waiters just supremely friendly waiters.In lieu of swimming we do what governments on both sides of the border have been recommending ndash get outdoors. First up is gundog training, a country pursuit I never experienced growing up on a council house scheme in West Lothian, but which thrills the girls who donrsquot care about having to wear plastic gloves. Then it is on to archery, shooting and falconry as we rattle through a greatest hits of Scottish country sports. Kids are really looked after here, even more so these days as Scott Dunn have just introduced their first ever UK programme of activities this month with Covid-era staycations in mind.When Scotlandrsquos well-heeled travellers realise a foreign holiday this year is a forlorn hope, Gleneagles is ready. But not everyone can splash out on such decadence. Our last stop is just up the road. We swap fluffy robes and marble bathrooms for a converted Leyland horse truck.Camping is all the rage this summer. As the author of Cool Camping: Scotland thatrsquos great to see. If the thought of struggling up your own tent on a windy west coast beach is too much, though, glamping tempts. Alexander House offers a brace of Mongolian style yurts, which are cosy with wood burning stoves and a surprising amount of space, with a separate bathroom with stand alone baths. The decking hosts a gas bbqand a wood fired hot tub. Once we work out how not to cook ourselves itrsquos a joy.The new option at Alexander House is Juniper. This vintage Leyland horse truck has been converted into a surprisingly swish hideaway. Itrsquos like a chic urban Airbnb inside, all fresh smelling wood ling and hipster deacutecor and furnishings. It also boasts a wee kitchen and the luxury of electricity. Outside wersquove got your own wee fenced area so you can bring a dog. And two kids. Ours love the resident brace of Highland cows who are very interested in our stay. Perhaps Dougal has forewarned them.Irsquove not mentioned Covid- for a few paragraphs and thatrsquos telling. We are now Covid-era travelling veterans, just enjoying the glorious outdoors and the scenery. For the record there are gel stations at the yurts and Juniper, the welcoming couple who run it donrsquot shake hands and wersquore assured our accommodations have been scrupulously sanitised. At the end of our stay our bedding is deep cleaned off site.When we eked out of our drive it was with real anxiety after being cooped up staring at pandemic ravaged TV screens. Everywhere we went, though, we have been reassured not only by the set-up, but also by the professionalism and consistency of the staff. The only aberrations were from fellow travellers not well versed in Scotlandrsquos lockdown measures, but thatrsquos similar to the confusion you can encounter in your local supermarket. If yoursquore thinking of a staycation our message would be go. Oh, but learn the FACTS beforehand unlike me. And perhaps most importantly of all, keep the heid.FactboxLoch Melfort Hotel - https:www.lochmelfort Red Moon Cruises - https:www.redmooncruises Gleneagles - https:gleneagles Alexander House - https:www.alexanderhousescotland glamping Scottish Government Covid advice - https:www.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- "},{"url":null,"title":"Country Life with Rosemary Goring  The simple joys of country walking","story":"Hooletrsquos church is one of the most historic in the area. Perhaps more importantly, it is also among the prettiest. Even the graveyard is appealing, with its beautully engraved and embellished th-century headstones, their coating of moss as useful as a compass for telling which way is north. Until Covid , passers-by were always welcome to enter. The day the kirk door is once more unlocked at all hours wersquoll know all is well again.Early last Sunday we had gone only a few yards when a friend stopped her car to chat. The last time we spoke she apologisedwe were catching a whf of venison liver, as a package had leaked on the passenger seat. Her collie was sitting beside her in the front, butthere was any lingering aroma she was the only one to catch it. Our friend is a boon to local butchers, as is Alan. The previous day he had queued behind a woman ordering lambrsquos liver for herself and her dog. When quizzed she revealed that she also gives him ham rolls with salad, although he always leaves the salad.The path we often take on Sundays is a regular circuit, whose interest never wanes. In good weather, the view over the Cheviots is like a Van Gogh, the foreground filled by fields of wheat or stubble, the hills a smudge of dark blue in the distance. Even in torrential rain the canopy of trees that hangs over the track acts as an umbrella. It would be possible to cover these short miles with only a few minutes entirely without shelter. Given recent downpours, though, those minutes make the dference between dry or squelchy boots.The previous Sunday we encountered a Geordie disconsolately smoking by a stile. He had been walking for a couple of hours after waking, in his tent, to find himself in two inches of water. His sleeping bag was soaked.His companion, who had held them back by stopping too often ldquofor a beer and a tar, had already abandoned the expedition. Even though the sun was shining, he seemed on the verge of doing the same. We pointed him towards Jedburgh, beyond which lay his destination of Holy Island, but will never knowhe made it.The path we usually take goes past a couple of farms. The main attraction lately is to catch a glimpse of a foal, which is only a few weeks old. Before we reached the paddock, we caught sight of him between the trees, ginger, spindly-legged and stuck to his motherrsquos side like a barnacle on a keel. A friend saw him one morning shortly after he had been turned into the field, galloping at full speed, legs out front and back.We stood by the gate, watching the older bay foal reclining on the grass, while the mares grazed. Then a renegade sheep made an unexpected appearance. It hirpled towards the horses, one foreleg dangling, but making good speed with its three ing limbs. In a moment, the young bay was up, putting its mother between him and the intruder. The sheep skirted them and went its way, and moments later, with danger passed, both foals were suckling. The little ones stumpy tail whirled asbattery operated.Continuing down the track, we were approached by horses on every side. Around here they are so used to people that they consider every passer-by a friend. Occasionally they have thundered along the field side to say hello.In one pasture, our steps startled them into galloping off, but when we leaned over the fence they cantered back, doubtless hoping for snacks. Like so many horses in summer, one was wearing a mesh hood as protection against flies. Its an idea hill-walkers should consider.Not long after reaching the old drove road, the sound of baying reached us from a farm where hounds are kennelled. It was so frenzied you might have thought a fox was taunting them from beyond the fence. It is always an unnerving noise, a throw-back, perhaps, to the howling of wolves.By the time we reached their farm, they had quietened. Its always a relief. I like dogs, but the prospect of being surrounded by an excited pack is worrying. Ive had more than enough run-ins with Alsatians and nippy sheep dogs to know how scary they can be when chasing you off their land.My sister was once bitten by a dog on a farm in France, and had to be given an anti-rabies injection in her stomach. Impressively stoical when it comes to medical matters, she still shudders at the memory. It was possibly even worse than the day she caught her fingers in the blender.The road past the farm leads to wooded hillside, beyond a lake. This morning two swans faced each other, creating the love heart shape so beloved of hoteliers as they contort hand-towels for your arrival. Three deep grey cygnets swam beside them, with no hint yet of white. Two have disappeared in recent weeks, feared to have fallen foul of foxes.Near the lake is a verge where last month we came across a family of newborn voles. One had been trampled, and its siblings were either in shock or simply too young to realise what had happened. I prodded them with a frond of grass to urge them back into the hedgerow, out of sight of passing predators.On our final mile, we encountered a creature that would have swallowed them like Coco Pops. In the cool green shade of an avenue of beeches, a heavy bird suddenly launched itself onto the air and disappeared deeper into the trees. As we got closer, it moved further again. Each time we were too far away to identy it. I thought buzzard, Alan an owl. The rest of the walk was spent trying to settle the matter, although like so much in the countryside, it will forever remain a mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-unionists-witch-hunt-opposition-just-sake","story":"It will be interesting to see how events unfold where, and in England particularly. There, awarding bodies applied similar processes to moderate estimates submitted by teachers that were \"ridiculously inflated\".

Yet he will undoubtedly remain in post, not due to superior processes applied by the English awarding bodies , not by virtue of superior competence or greater integritybut by by dint of the Toriesrsquo overall majority of  .The SNP is a minority administration despite achieving  per cent of the vote in . The dference is due to the peculiarities of the two electoral systems, the one guaranteed to produce an overall majority in Westminster on as little as  per cent of the votes, the other designed to prevent an overall majority under any but the most unpredictable circumstances. The result has been shameless opportunism by the Unionist parties in proposing a vote of no confidence in John Swinney, when he did what any education secretary should do in protecting the value of the qualications awarded to candidates, as all candidates suffer when their awards are devalued. Had the SQA awarded a % pass rate based on teachersrsquo inflated estimates, he would have been castigated by these same parties. Tory MSP Jamie Greene even called for the resignation of Fiona Robertson for, effectively, not only following the instructions of her employer, the Education Secretary, but also of protecting the value of SQArsquos qualications as she was bound to do in her contract of employment. This smacks of opposition for oppositionrsquos sake but for Unionists, the Union comes before everything.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.I FEEL Rebecca McQuillan somewhat misses the point over what the public perceive of both the pandemic, and the reaction to it of their leaders . I suspect most people see Scotland as suffering heavy coronavirus mortality as a consequence of UK ldquolockstep, and that having erged from that would assess us as doing better. Nicola Sturgeon stands up daily to answer questions, and is regarded as trustworthy all over the UK in a way that Boris Johnson is not.You donrsquot require weasel words like ldquosaintly to describe competence. Impartial news and journalism is important. The media that operates in Scotland, not least the BBC, have allowed themselves to be exploited as a conduit for attacks on the governing party in a way that does not happen in England. The public arenrsquot daft they can see this bias in the dferent emphasis placed, for example, on the education ldquoshambles on both sides of the Border. You can see it on any health issue, where the BBC in Scotland immediately escalates every story to a government ministerial responsibility. That never happens in England, in spite of repeated serious health scandals over decades.Why does this matter  It seems that repeated, and context-free, SNP-bad stories have inured many in the public into regarding much of the news as Unionist ldquodisinformation, and increasingly easy to ignore. An interesting project for universities to evaluate. The latest wheeze is to badge every spending commitment to Scotland with a Union flag asScots did not pay taxes. Will it give Scotland a fair per capita share of UK spending, for example, in defence spending and procurement  And the BBC, which will be expected to promote this stunt, will it spend in Scotland the same per capita share of its licence fee, as England GR Weir, Ochiltree.MY support for independence rests on the simple fact that it would allow the people of Scotland to elect the Government of their choice rather than having one chosen by voters south of the border. It has nothing to do with the competence or otherwise of any political parties or inidual politicians but has everything to do with my perception of the competence of the Scottish nation. Against this, your regular anti-independence correspondents, including Dr Gerald Edwards and James Martincan offer nothing better than their view that Nicola Sturgeon may be brilliant but John Swinney is useless. How does that in any way relate to the democratic deficit which underpins the case for independence Willie Maclean, Milngavie.CONGRATULATIONS to your correspondent James Martin, for condensing into one short paragraph the most brilliant piece of doublespeak that Ive ever read in your Letters Pages. He refuses to comment on the suitability of the Education Secretary for the position while at the same time labelling Mr Swinney incapable of holding any government post.Gordon Evans, Burnside.GERALD Edwardsasks the question \"Is Scotland really a democracy any more \" As the no-confidence vote against John Swinney failed because it wasnt backed by the majority of MSPs, then clearly the answer is that Scotland is a democracy. The political make-up of the Scottish Parliament may not meet with Dr Edwardss approval, but he and all of Scotlands voters will be able to have their say next May and we will get the government we elect, unlike the situation at Westminster where we get not only the government England elects, but an unelected second chamber, where the already excessive numbers are due to be swollen still more by a Dame who is currently ensconced in Holyrood as a Tory MSP. Wheres the democracy in that Dr Edwards need have no fear that \"independence will be foisted upon us\". Scotland will regain her independence when Scotlands voters make that choice, and as there has been a \"signicant and material change of circumstance\" since  and as opinion polls increasingly indicate that voters want to make that choice, there should be no obstacles put in Scotlands way to prevent the choice being made. That would be a real travesty of democracy.Ruth Marr, Stirling.A NEW poll shows that four in  Scots, including a majority of SNP voters, do not want English tourists to be admitted to Scotland . I can only assume that these substantial numbers of people are not themselves involved in the tourist industry, and that they do not have family members, neighbours or friends who are so involved. The tourist industry has been very hard hit by the coronavirus, and consists of far more than BBs and attractions of ious kinds. Shops, pubs, bars, restaurants and taxis, and more, all benefit greatly from tourists.I can only assume that those who would bar from Scotland English people ndash who normally come here in their droves ndash have some kind of atavistic grudge and no concern for their fellow Scots who depend on tourists of all kinds for a livelihood. The virus has given them an excuse to air a prejudice that has become all too evident in recent years.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.CATRIONA Stewart gives the Tory Party a good kicking over the migrant \"invasion\" . Fair enough, thats her right, but her remedy is simplistic and naive.\"The solution,\" she writes, \"is to make it easier for people to claim asylum, working with our EU neighbours.\"She overlooks the fact that the same asylum seekers are already in EU neighbouring territory and want out for sanctuary and a better le in the UK. She should be asking why Britain is superior, even under a Tory Government.James Miller, Glasgow G.THE UK Government is fully justied in displaying the Union flag on projects in Scotland which it has funded, thereby calling time on an EU propaganda racket of labelling projects as \"Funded by the EU\" ,which in fact are funded from the pound billion annual paymentinto EU coffers by the British Government courtesy of the British taxpayer.Morag Black, Houston.I HAVE great sympathy for the locals in Durness and the problems with ldquo dirty campersbut I am afraid that an appeal to Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government will fall on deaf ears.Just as we in Scotland may well feel that the Westminster Government cares little about north of the Border, so residents of Durness and all areas north of Perth probably feel that the Scottish Government cares only for the Central Belt, maybe because that is where the votes are.I do wonder which parts of the country the ldquodirty campers come from and from what age group they represent.I am not from the central belt, but from a small coastal Ayrshire village also plagued by the ldquodirty campers and have great sympathy for those living in the north.This lack of interest in parts out with the Central Belt is not exclusive to the SNP but also applies to the other main parties, sad to say.Malcolm Rankin, Seamill."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-country-sports-not-just-rich","story":"She makes assumptions that only those wealthy enough an enjoy the delights of our rivers, moors and mountains.

However the notion now only invades my personal space after a glass or two of gin, before the burdensome impediments steamroller it. Therersquos a practical issue, of course, that Irsquod have to start my own liberal , post-constitutional political party.That could be navigated, with enough financial support. Much more dficult to overcome would be my ubiquitous feeling that being a politician simply wouldnrsquot be worth the hassle.Events tell us that I am not the only one who thinks so. The end of this fth term of the Scottish Parliament is being characterised, one might say scarred, by the voluntary departure of some high-profile, high-quality MSPs, ostensibly still in their prime.There are always retirements . However this trend of good, younger people leaving in search of something more palatable should be of paramount concern. If it is not yet an exodus, it is certainly a trend, and it is in effect across the political spectrum.At next Mayrsquos election, the SNP will lose Aileen Campbell and Gail Ross, one an established Minister and Cabinet Secretary, and the other most likely on track to becoming one.The Tories will lose Ruth Davidson and Adam Tomkins, the first being by some distance the biggest name the party has ever had, and the second a real henrsquos tooth an MSP who combines academic intelligence and political smarts.And Labour will lose Neil Findlay, someone who can break the Holyrood mould by making a speech without having his eyes fixated on a script.These are people of high ability and with good ideas. There are dferent drivers behind their decisions, to be sure, and I will not imprint them here on each inidualrsquos behalf, but the fact remains that whatever their reasons, they are united by one overriding view: this is not worth it. And we should all be deeply worried that they think that.Perhaps last weekrsquos events in Holyrood gave us eyes on the problem. In John Swinney, few would question that we have as an education secretary a real political heavyweight. A man of substance and morals. A good man. He has erred during this time in the role, most notably in buckling before the trade union when he was thwarted in his attempts to empower schools and teachers, and more recently when he failed to foresee the incandescence amongst parents and health professionals at the thought of children not ing to school full time.Butwe are in search of a politician who doesnrsquot make mistakes, wersquoll spend a long time searching. Last week, Mr Swinney faced a vote of no confidence in the Scottish Parliament, with us urged to believe that the very act of him being replaced would suddenly propel us to educational excellence.This was the result of his perfectly sensible proposal to moderate the exam results to replicate as closely as possible the outcome of real exams. It was the least imperfect of a set of imperfect options.We did what, in this country, we just love to do. Labour argued that every student should be awarded their teacher estimate even though it is perfectly clear that employers and universities will forever look upon this cohort as tainted. The Tories agreed even though theyrsquove spent  years arguing against grade inflation. And the Government caved, even though it knew it was allowing optics to override policy.Watching from outside the bubble, Scotland felt very small last week. And it made me think, as I have many times before, who would want to do this  Who would want to be John Swinney  Who would want to be an MSP Irsquove been around politicians all my working le, so please allow me to give you a snapshot of their existence.They work long and hard. Commonly - hours a week, sometimes more, and usually seven days a week. Most of them travel, having to stay away from their families three nights a week. They spend their days in Parliament, their evenings at meetings and s related to work, and their weekends seeing constituents at surgeries or cutting ribbons at community events.We expect this from them, and wersquore angrywe donrsquot get it. If they are not omnipresent, we abuse them. Usually online, where they are commonly subjected to bile , but also sometimes in the street.If they make a mistake, or eventhey donrsquot, we deride them. They are mocked in the press, live and in colour for their parents, partners and children to read.And we demand they do all of this for a salary similar to that available in a middle management role at a local authority.This is not designed to incite a wave of sympathy for Ministers or politicians. Nobody makes them stand, or seek high office. The SNP would have done to a Tory or Labour Minister what they had done to them last week. And they all must shoulder their fair share of blame for the fairly depressing relationship we endure between the three legs of the stool: politicians, media and people.But we should be clear where this ends. It ends with more good politicians leaving. It ends with less talented people, who do not have as many employment options out in the real world, being elected in their place.The solution lies in joint action to make Holyrood a better place to be. That means political change, where adult behaviour replaces pettiness. It means a joint sht in the relationship and understanding between politicians and the media. And it means the public giving politicians some room for manoeuvre, including a signicant rise in their salary.We can keep going the way we arewe wish to. But wersquoll end up with the politicians we deserve.bull Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If, like me, your readers were hoping for cogent analysis and logical thinking they would have been disappointed.His theme is SNP grievance, but Mr Stevensonrsquos article is redolent with his own grievance that by some inexplicable paradox, support for both the SNP and independence is steadily rising while all around, all he sees is failure and despair.He berates SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford for taunting him with the mantra of ldquotoo wee, too poor, too stupid. However, he then attempts, with the aid of some dubious back of an envelope calculations, to demonstrate that Scotland is essentially bankrupt, unable to support a currency or public services and unable to achieve equivalence with countries such as Ireland or Denmark. He opines we are so economically toxic that Scotland would be shunned by the EU.Does Mr Stevenson really believe that  And,he does, is it a good reason for persisting with a -year-old Union which has left us in such penury He then recycles the tired arguments of Better Together circa . Discovering oil was an economic disaster, Scotlandrsquos deficit is the largest in Europe, we are totally dependent on the largesse of London and so on. For Mr Stevenson and those of his ilk, any thought of constitutional change can only be measured against the yardstick of his version of economics. Itrsquos all about bawbees and siller in your pocket, especiallyyoursquore a higher rate taxpayer.The answer to his paradox, of course, is not to be found in balance sheets or economic statistics. Itrsquos staring him in the face. Since  Scotland has voted decisively against Brexit and three Tory governments, yet all have been imposed by the Union. Thatrsquos where the grievance lies and thatrsquos the reason for the increasing support for the SNP and Independence.Iain Gunn, Elgin.STRUAN Stevenson states that it would ldquocost around pound billion to establish our own currency. He has, however, got it this the wrong way round.To put  billion Scots Pounds into circulation, you take in pound billion Sterling in exchange. This forms the reserve as backing for the Scots currency, although I would suggest that some of the Sterling be sold in exchange for gold and or dollars, since Sterling is a very weak currency, and the Scots pound would be stronger. The reason for this is that the UK has, for a good number of years, been running a trade deficit, usually at least pound billion annually, whereas Scotland has, since records began, always shown a balance of trade surplus, currently around pound billion a year.Older readers like me will remember the post-war mantra ldquoexport or die, the IMF bail-out when James Callaghan was Chancellor and the conditions imposedand the fall of Sterling from the post-war  to the pound to . to the pound now.Since the last world war, about  countries have become independent. Nearly all established their own currency very quickly with no fuss, little expense, and a lot of advantages.But maybe Mr Stevenson would have preferred to stay with the Titanic rather than risk a leboat.Ian Macdonald, Bearsden.STRUAN Stevenson repeats the mantra about Scotlandrsquos ldquodeficit, ignoring as usual that, whatever this figure is supposed to actually represent, it is mostly generated as a result of mismanaged fiscal powers reserved by the UK Government. The Scottish Government, allowed very limited fiscal freedoms, balances its budget every year. When was the last time the UK managed to do this  Elsewhere he refers to Scotlandrsquos Covid- death rate being higher than Norwayrsquos, a unionist deceit since, again, it was the delayed, incompetent deployment of powers reserved to the UK Government that resulted in the unnecessary deaths of our fellow Scots.These are but two typical examples of the flimsiness of the unionist cause.

She is disingenuous with her take on the point being made by Dr Edwards, who raised the quite reasonable complaint that the vote was defeated only because the Greens, who at the last election gained . per cent of the vote, sided with the Governments .% of the vote, thus the majority represented in parliament was denied and Mr Swinney survived in situ. This undoubtedly is bad for our young people and bad for our education system going forward and may well have unintended consequences for the First Minister, who asked the public some time ago to judge her on her record in education.If the system as it currently stands allows this quite indefensible denial of democracy then the system needs fixed, and quickly.James Martin, Bearsden.PRIME Minister Boris Johnson is keen on saying he would rather die than allow certain things to happen.In September  he would ldquorather be dead in a ditch than agree to extend Brexit beyond October , before then having to go cap in hand to Brussels to request a delay until January , .Most recently he noted that there would be a trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ldquoover his dead body.Bizarrely, that was after Cabinet Officer Minister Michael Gove announced funding of pound million to ease trade over what was, according to the PM, a border that doesnrsquot and wonrsquot exist.It appears that Mr Johnson has surpassed Lazarus, not just rising once, but twice from the dead.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.Read more: Letters: Unionistsrsquo witch hunt is opposition just for the sake of it"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-not-hesitate-call-friends-covidiots","story":"I know of one former colleague, a senior pilot with British Airways, who openly boasts on social media of giving a  name and phone number when visiting pubs.

They also said increased vitamin D levels could be protective for people with the dementia gene.The AD gene - Apolipoprotein endash is a major genetic risk factor for the disease, and is found in around a quarter of the population. It increases the risk of developing dementia by at least three times.The researchers looked at a wide range of blood molecules ndash including cholesterols, markers of inflammation, vitamin D, sex-specic hormones and renal- in people carrying the AD gene to better understand the mechanisms of it and the risk of developing dementia.The study found relatively large associations of neuro-inflammatory and cholesterol biomarkers, such as low-density lipoprotein levels, in people with a genetically-high risk of Alzheimerrsquos.Previous studies also reported an association between APOE e and higher vitamin D levels however, this study found decreased levels.Dr Donald Lyall, public health lecturer at the Universityrsquos Institute of Health and Wellbeing and senior author, said: ldquoOur research confirmed that the [dementia gene] predicted subsequent dementia.\"But, more importantly, by looking at such a large sample size and such a wide range of biomarkers ndash both in patients with the disease and those currently non-demented but at high genetic riskndash we were able to get a lsquobig picturersquo look at the role of common biomarkers and this gene, which is considered to be dementia-causing.ldquoOur findings of relatively-large associations between [the gene] with neuro-inflammatory biomarkers and elevated cholesterol levels, reinforces that these biological pathways are important to our understanding of common, late-onset Alzheimerrsquos disease.ldquoWhile these findings could suggest biomarkers for dementia, further studies are needed to fully determine their role in dementia, both in those with a high genetic risk for Alzheimerrsquos disease and more generally.Lead author Dr Amy Ferguson added: ldquoWe hope that, by continuing to understand biomarkers of those at genetic risk of AD, we can one day use them in early detection of AD and, hopefully, potential pathways for future prevention, management and treatment options.Alzheimerrsquos disease is the most common form of dementia, and is believed to be the result of interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors.News of the biomarker research comes after it was reported that a blood test could spot Alzheimers disease at the earliest stage and years before symptoms appear, according to US and Swedish researchers.The test looks for tiny amounts of a protein which is elevated in people with the illness.Investigators found measuring this protein, p-tau, could predict Alzheimers dementia with % accuracy.Experts said that with more research, it could be developed into a test doctors could offer to patients.Currently, Alzheimers is diagnosed using a combination of memory tests and brain scans, once symptoms have already appeared.The idea of a dementia blood test is not new, but the two latest studies give the clearest indication yet that a protein associated with Alzheimers disease could be used to diagnose people at a much earlier stage.The University of Glasgow study is published today in the Journal of Alzheimerrsquos Disease.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

A really great day. When I heard the news that Peter Weir was allowing centre-assessed grades from teachers to be used for GCSE students# results on Thursday but was staying firm on A-levels, I and so many others were outraged at one set of rules for one and a dferent set for the other. After hearing the news that A-level students are now being awarded their teacher centre-assessed grades, I am delighted.It has been a turbulent few days for students, parents, s, teachers and so many others who helped to U-turn this decision. I have spoken to fellow students who have come forward to tell their story, as well as many courageous parents who spoke out against their children being wronged.The pressure from the media and people coming forward to share their stories has told.We owe a huge debt of gratitude to every journalist who asked the tough questions that needed answering to every teacher for their hard work in preparing our grades with the sufficient evidence to every politician who stood up for us, and to every single person who put pressure on Mr Weir to do the right thing.As a result of young people stepping up and speaking out to challenge Mr Weir and Justin Edwards, who heads up CCEA, we have finally got the grades we deserve.I am thrilled with the result for students in Northern Ireland and I am so glad teachers have been listened to and their professionalism acknowledged.It does disappoint me that all of this could have been avoidedMr Weir had considered the future of young people receiving results on Thursday before now. We cannot go back in time, but we can certainly learn lessons from this.It cannot be ignored that the A-level fiasco has had a negative impact on the mental health of young people.It must be considered that young people lost out on the traditional rites of passage after secondary school: the farewells to teachers and other students, the end-of-school parties and summer holiday plans.The added trauma of not receiving fair A-level grades was devastating for so many of us and the past few days have been dficult. I#m glad we can now work to move forward and get back on track - but it shouldn#t have been like this.I often read young people have the power to change the world and today that quote couldn#t be more true. We have the power to use our voice and in recent days people have used their s in incredible ways. We were failed.

The SDLP said it was a win for students but called on Mr Weir to publish the controversial algorithm which he indicated he would do.On Monday morning the minister announced that GCSEs would be based solely on teacher predictions, but he failed to move on AS and A-levels. An SDLP motion to recall the Assembly to discuss the matter was signed by Sinn Fein, UUP, Alliance, the Greens, People Before Profit, the TUV, and independent MLAs Jim Wells, Claire Sugden, and Trevor Lunn.Teachers had been asked to give predicted grades, but then other data - including the past performances of students# schools - was used by the exams body CCEAto standardise the results.Announcing his U-turn at pm on Monday, Mr Weir said: My prime concern is to ensure that young people in Northern Ireland are in no way disadvantaged in comparison to their peers where.Portability and comparability of qualications is critical for students, particularly in Northern Ireland.In the challenging situation in which we find ourselves, there are no perfect solutions. I hope today#s decision will provide a  for [students] to go forward positively into higher education, employment or training.More than a third of A-level grades issued last Thursday were lower than teacher estimates.The proportion of A* to A A-level grades rose by .%.In total, % were lowered while .% were raised.A-level and GCSE students in England and Wales will also be given estimates by their teachers.Robert Wilson, Northern Ireland regional officer of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: We welcome the decision to put an end to the grading fiasco of using only standardised grades.NUS-USI students# union president Ellen Fearon said the decision was a huge relief to students who have faced months of uncertainty already.She added: This victory belongs to students who would not accept their futures being decided by an unjust algorithm.UUP MLA Robbie Butler said: This is a fair and just resolution so that students can make the decisions that best suit their future educational and career paths. I am glad that the Department of Education has now accepted that it is right to place trust in teachers to grade students# A-level work.However, the question will be asked why did it have to be this way  This decision could have been made long before now. It#s very late in the day. Students have been put through immense stress. Given that mental health is the number one issue for young people this has only piled misery upon misery.Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: While this news is welcome, we are not through the woods just yet. The Education Minister#s delay has risked many pupils missing their university place. We now need a prompt delivery of the new grades and support for those who need it to move on in their educational career.SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said: This is a win for our teachers and their professional judgement, but most importantly, a win for our young people.They fought tirelessly against the flawed standardisation process and for grades that accurately reflected their ability and their work ethic.Green Party education spokesperson, Councillor Simon Lee, said: The Education Minister has made this U-turn as a result of pressure from teachers, parents and pupils. Credit to them for demanding an equitable resolution to this fiascoIt#s been a fiasco that was entirely foreseeable since problems with standardisation began to emerge with the publication of results in Scotland.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged.

He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Dr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks. That could be a risky strategy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Connor Bamford FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Connor BamfordUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey said that even before the lockdown was introduced businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, saw a downturn in custom and demand.He said when businesses were told to close, those who didn#t have cash reserves found themselves left exposed.However, Mr Ramsey said the scale of the support provided to businesses during lockdown was huge.If you thought beforehand that they would introduce things like a furlough scheme or eat out to help out, it wouldn#t have been thought possible, the economist said.While he accepted that some people may think not enough support has been provided, Mr Ramsey said that he believed further measures would be forthcoming.The chancellor isn#t done providing stimulus yet, we expect to see more in the autumn, it will be more targeted and dferent from what we#ve seen, it#s not the end of it, he said.Mr Ramsey said he believed businesses had come through the worst of the pandemic.We#ve seen huge falls in lockdown, it stopped dead, but you#ve then seen recovery, the corner had been turned in terms of activity, he said.He cautioned that the jobs market was one area that was set to get worse in the months to come.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappUlster Bank economist Richard RamseyMy view:If the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise, then the Executive will have some very dficult decisions to make.Despite spending much of the past few years engaging in petty public squabbles, the parties came together when the outbreak began, just months after Stormont#s institutions were restored.Now as cases look to be on the rise once again, our politicians will have to decide what steps are necessary to halt the spread of the virus.Rolling back on any lockdown easements could be met with widespread public resistance.One only has to look at the debate created by the mandatory wearing - and, in some cases defiance - of masks to see the public has become weary of widespread government intervention in their lives.However, the Executive must do what it deems necessary to protect public health.If we continue to see Covid clusters developing in certain areas then we are more likely to see localised lockdowns, but the question remains how effective would this be in a country the size of Northern Ireland.Just a few short weeks ago cases were in the single figures, businesses and public facilities were reopening, people were ing to work and beginning to foresee ato some normality.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Doses of the Oxford vaccine PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDoses of the Oxford vaccine Now it feels like we are beginning to go backwards rather than forward.It is still unknown what effect reopening schools could have on the spread of the virus.If cases continues to rise then it is likely an increased number of deaths will follow.Should we see ato daily reports of multiple Covid- deaths, the Executive will be forced to take action, no matter how unpopular it may be.The virus remains unpredictable and until we have a widely available vaccine, any hopes of ato pre-Covid times seem distant.

However, the fact that , burglaries still occurred during lockdown , even when Stormont’s most stringent quarantine measures were in place, highlights that break-ins remain a very real risk for homeowners and tenants alike.” He urged homeowners to remain vigilant and not to forego insurance despite being in their dwellings more often. “Remember to always double check doors and windows are locked when leaving your property or going to bed, set security alarms when necessary, keep valuables out of sight, apply light timers when off on holiday to make it seem like the property is occupied, and ask anyone entering your house for professional reasons for ID,” he said.

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The striker scored from the penalty spot before being withdrawn with a slight injury, but he believes he will be available for this weekends game against Cork City at the Brandywell. “I felt my quad in the first half,” he explained. “Its just not been playing for a long time, Ive been in quarantine and running and stuff. Game intensity is a lot harder than running on a run or just running but I think it will be alright. googletag.cmd.push For Derry City fans, Meites goal was a long end to penalty misery which has lasted over a year.The Candystripes have not had the best of times from  yards since Declan Devine ed to the club, scoring just twice in six attempts. Last year, Jamie McDonagh and David Parkhouse both missed from the spot, while Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe missed twice, before scoring from the rebound each time. Eoghan Stokes was the only player successful from the spot, scoring twice. Throw in penalty shoot-out defeat to Dundalk in the EA Sports League Cup final and its easy to see why even the award of a penalty is still met with some trepidation by the clubs fans.That history was completely unknown to Meiete of course, who showed great skill to tempt Sean Quinn into an illegal challenge. Meite swept the ball home confidently to get off the mark on his City debut.“I knewwas coming and I thoughtI just got out behind him and a bit wide he night get a touch on me and he hammered me,” he recalled.“As a striker everyone wants to get that first goal to get their confidence up and start scoring more. Ive got my first goal so hopefully I can kick on and get a lot more now The first half we were in the game. We played well and played to our strengths and we got the penalty and tucked it away. The first half we were really strong.”Meite has had to be patient, unable to even train with his team mates because of quarantine regulations. The striker, who was substituted early in the second half, admits he is still not at % fitness, but is optimistic he will be up to speed in no time.“Im just trying to get my body back to % so Im going to work hard in training and hopefully we can get more wins,” he said.“Im enjoying le in Derry but to be honest the first two weeks I had to quarantine for  days.“I was just chilling and training on my own, which wasnt very glamourous. I couldnt wait to get in with the boys but I have been working hard on my own so hopefully I can pick up more fitness and get going and get more goals. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours.

to a genuinely great political leader, he said.ldquoA few years ago during a visit with the late Maurice Hayes at his home in Downpatrick a chat about developing GAA facilities was taken on a brilliant rambling tangent re John Hume.Maurice knew him well, and opened a door to the man Irsquod only known through my studies at that point. It was laden with humour and humility ndash but also plenty of lessons for us all today.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath spoke of the respect he had for Mr Humersquos commitment to ldquopeace and peaceful non-violent dialogue.He said: ldquoIn all his days, no matter how often he was attacked, John never once turned to violence and lived those very ideals of peaceful nonviolent resistance. He showed us that it was possible. He showed us that peace was achievable. We believed him, because of how radically he believed in those ideals and lived them.Mr McGrath said that through his work, Mr Hume offered ldquoyoung and old alike a vision of a future in which the gun would be removed from Irish politics, no matter how hard terrorists would and continue to resist this.Council chairperson Laura Devlin, praised Mr Hume as ldquoa man of peace and a ldquotrue hero who left a ldquolasting legacy as one of the highest profile politicians on the island of Ireland who was highly respected by all communities.Addressing the councilrsquos full virtual monthly meeting on Monday, she asked: ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to the contribution this man has made to the landscape of Ireland ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to this man who stood beside his community through Northern Irelandrsquos most terrying and dark days and walked proudly beside them as we ushered in together the days of peace Cllr Devlin added that from his example, she entered politics to ldquorepresent the needs of the community and added: ldquoIn all of his years, in all his roles, whether as an MLA, an MP, an MEP, a teacher, a family man, a friendhelliphis people came first.Respect was shown to Mr Hume and condolences to his family came from right across the political ide in the council chamber.Councillor Billy Walker, on behalf of the DUP council group, paid his respects to Mr Humersquos family and to the wider SDLP group.He said the death was a ldquosad loss to politics and paid tribute to Mr Humersquos determination to peace-making and ldquoremoving the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland, even sometimes when his own party did not support him during the Hume-Adams talks.He added: ldquoI also had the greatest admiration and respect of how the three then MEPs, John Hume, Ian Paisley and John Taylor, despite their political dferences, worked together to bring millions of European money into Northern Ireland for the benefit of us all.Alliance councillor Andrew McMurray said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we wouldnrsquot live in the Northern Ireland we do today.ldquoHis enormous contribution to the peace process, the end of violence and the determination to deliver a society built on peace and equality for everyone which be his lasting legacy along with a le well-lived.ldquoAs a young man growing up it was very obvious to me that John Hume was not only a man who stood for things but stood against things.Councillor Pete Byrne, leader of the SDLP council group, thanked his council colleagues for their kind words and said that the level of international tributes being made about Mr Hume reflected the ldquohigh level of esteem he was held in.ldquoItrsquos very hard to overstate the importance of John Hume to this island, he said. ldquoThrough the most dficult times, John fought for justice, equality and peace.ldquoHe taught me to have respect for dference and ersity and I think thatrsquos a message thatrsquos really important today.ldquoI want to thank John for delivering the institutions that we have today, they may not be perfect, but it brought peace to our streets and I want to thank John for leaving the blueprint for us all to build upon.SDLP councillor Dermot Curran called his former party leader as being ldquoa man of the people, for the people in his tribute.He said: ldquoAlong with the late Eddie McGrady, we worked with John a lot over the years, particularly when he was an MEP in Europe over fishing interests.ldquoI always remember he would tell me that he never sought to be a leader, only to help people. That stuck with me and it was something that I carried with me in my work.ldquoHis unstinting work for peace and what he did for us all cannot be understated.Due to Covid- restrictions, the Book of Condolence is now available online at https:www.newrymournedown.org chairpersons-book-of-condolences until Monday, August .All messages in the online book will be recorded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and sent directly to Mr Humersquos family..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield Horse Show success  ","story":"THIS yearrsquos Saintfield Horse Show on Saturday at Eugene Milliganrsquos ldquomagnicent venue in Castlewellan was hailed as one of the best shows and attracted a large number of entries mdash despite the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.Competitors came from all over the island and were delighted with the huge, flat rings and the well laid out ground.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoThere was sun, fun and something for everyone who attended.

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
