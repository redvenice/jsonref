When his boss was taken into custody, he was pressured to take over the drug dealing business and also wanted to maintain his own supply.Jackson initially planned to go to trial but entered late guilty pleas, then fled the country while out on bail and awaiting sentencing.He intended to start a new life in Bali but had no plan for when he got there and did not have much money.Jackson appeared at Perth magistrates court via video link from the maximum security Casuarina prison on Wednesday and was sentenced for breaching bail, possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing stolen property.The court heard the weapon was a stun gun that was found in his car when police pulled him over in Perth city centre in 2016, while the stolen property related to A$10,250 (£5,600) in cash, suspected of being either the proceeds of drug sales or money to buy drugs.The cash was found by police, again in 2016, when they went to a property looking for someone else and spotted Jackson trying to conceal the money while sitting in a car.He was fined a total of A$500 (£275) for the bail breach and weapon charges, and given a four-month prison sentence for the stolen property charge, to be served concurrently with his current jail term.He is likely to face deportation to the UK, which he left at the age of five, after serving his sentence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4b3e941552513081d0925c7d8ed125ee7923aa/0_132_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b45c86a8b654045569ae444e5920a6aa","title":"going home by raja shehadeh review","story":"The changing face of one West Bank city, and the ‘overwhelming reality’ of continued Israeli controlRamallah, just north of Jerusalem in the West Bank, used to be a pretty if dull provincial town. It nestled in the hills overlooking the Mediterranean to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east. The churches and mosques scattered among its red-roofed stone houses gave it a pastoral quality enhanced by flourishing jacarandas, bougainvilleas and cypresses. Raja Shehadeh was born there in 1950, two years after the Nakba, the expulsion, flight and dispossession of Palestinians when Israel was created at the end of the British mandate. His parents were refugees from Jaffa, the country’s once vibrant port. Shehadeh was 16 in 1967 when “our unwanted, unrecognised neighbours from across the horizon came and took over our lives”, as he puts it.Following law studies in London in the 1970s he returned to found Al-Haq, the human rights organisation that did pioneering work documenting abuses under what was then seen – from abroad – as Israel’s relatively liberal rule. His new book, Going Home, records a poignant and thought-provoking stroll around Ramallah on 5 June 2017 – the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation.Shehadeh’s anniversary walk combines the personal and the political. Childhood memories of Jordanian rule – when local taxi drivers touted for passengers travelling to Jerusalem, Amman and Beirut – are accompanied by reflections on the universal ravages of ageing. Relations with his father, who was murdered by a collaborator in 1985, were always difficult. After the landmark Oslo agreement in 1993, Shehadeh’s dentist warned him that he was grinding his teeth. He reflects throughout on the gardens and wildlife he loves. Writing keeps him sane in a melancholy environment.The creation of the quasi-government of the Palestinian Authority saw Palestinian policemen replace Israeli troops in patrolling Ramallah. It is no longer a backwater. Restaurants, ice-cream parlours and diplomatic missions line the streets. Branches of KFC and Pizza Hut draw crowds from nearby villages. Property prices are soaring, fuelled by foreign aid, bank loans and exiles selling their now distant homes – though without paying any local taxes. Palestinian flags – once strictly banned – flutter everywhere in “the city of our confinement”. In a hilly part of town tall buildings now block a once soothing evening breeze.These cultural changes reflect broader shifts. Shehadeh nostalgically remembers an Italian pop group that used to perform before 1967. But these days the sound of Qur’anic readings between calls to prayer fills the air. “The defeat of the nationalist project in Palestine by Israel that followed in the wake of Oslo encouraged the rise of political Islam,” he writes. “Religion has become another weapon in the arsenal of struggle.” Many more women wear headscarves. His bleak but hardly surprising conclusion is that his own generation has not managed to challenge the “overwhelming reality” of Israel’s control. How the young are supposed to achieve that is not explained.Israeli outposts first started appearing in the early 1970s and played a starring role in Shehadeh’s acclaimed 2007 book Palestinian Walks. Nowadays the settlers have their own access roads that are barred to Palestinians, reinforcing the argument that a form of apartheid is in place in the West Bank and that there is a distinct possibility of formal Israeli annexation of large parts it. Beit El, one of the early settlements, is clearly visible from the centre of Ramallah. Israeli army checkpoints surround it on all sides, reinforcing the sense that it is a bubble. Still, life in the West Bank is far better than elsewhere – especially the besieged Gaza Strip.Going Home cements the author’s reputation as the best-known Palestinian writing in English. Interestingly, there is only one mention in it of a word (a concept really) that was the centrepiece of his previous books – sumoud – steadfastness in Arabic, less pompously translated as “hanging in there”. Retracing his steps he now finds little that is heroic, including the grim period of the second intifada and the return of all-out occupation. “It’s more a chronicle of repeated failures. Both we and the Israelis who were against the settlement project have failed to find a way of living together and that’s the biggest tragedy. Now time is running out.”Walking past St George’s School, Shehadeh remembers the teenage pupil who was shot dead – live on camera – while demonstrating near an Israeli prison and army checkpoint, on a plain with a pond that was a haven for migrating birds but is no longer accessible to Palestinians. “For me and my generation the struggle has aged, become blocked, just like that road is blocked,” he laments. “I know how it used to be, but I don’t know how to unblock it and allow the life that was once there to thrive again.” • Going Home is published by Profile (£14.99).

Sometimes it’s the other way around. Sometimes the wounds are so grievous, there’s no coming through them at all.” Obreht is superb at tracing such inescapable wounds, both personal and national. Her 2011 Orange prize-winning debut, The Tiger’s Wife, mapped the aftermath of civil conflict in an unnamed “Balkan country still scarred by war”, which was based on her native Serbia (born in Belgrade in 1985, Obreht moved to the US at the age of 12). The fictional territory of Inland is as vivid and as violent: Arizona in the second half of the 19th century, populated by “cowpokes and prospectors”, gunslingers and cattle kings – and, yes, cameleers.Magic realism served Obreht well in her fable about Yugoslavia’s baroque isions, and it’s no less effective in shaping this alternative foundation myth about the American west. On the face of it the book begins conventionally enough, with the story of an outlaw, Lurie, who is on the run. The twist lies in Obreht’s affinity for unusual transformations. Like her, Lurie comes to America from the Balkans, as an immigrant child called Djurić. His surname is swiftly anglicised and he has a brief career as a gang member before falling in with the US Camel Corps on its way from Texas to California. Here truth proves stranger than fiction. The Camel Corps was a short-lived experiment introducing the animals into the US army as beasts of burden, manned by drivers from the Ottoman empire. Billed by wanted posters as a “hirsute Levantine”, Lurie finds that his ambiguous ethnicity provides the perfect cover for a new life as an ersatz camel-riding Turk.Lurie is just one of many wounded trying to remake themselves in a terrain whose emptiness serves as a clean slate for fantasies of conquest and escape. A shapeshifter, he is permeable to the histories of others, living and dead. Like The Tiger’s Wife, this book is peopled by the casualties of empire: vanished children, displaced women and ghostly armies of the men who stood up for the right to call the territory their own:The doomed French rode up from the desert with their brilliant pennants flying. Small cavalries of dead Indians roamed the old battletrails. Their arrowheads still lay thick on the ground in the groves where they’d fought and died and won and lost. Every now and again some dead rider would pass us, hurrying home to be reborn.Exquisitely panoramic as it is, Lurie’s account of his travels forms only one strand of the novel. It’s interwoven with the tale of a single day in the life of Nora, a frontierswoman whose remote homestead is “the last known place before the page went blank”. Nora is doing her best to get through the Arizona drought as she waits for her husband to return from town with water. She is at home with her young son, her paralysed mother-in-law and a fey servant girl who is convinced she has seen a strange beast prowling about the property in the night. Parched and beset, Nora dismisses this as an illusion – except that in this sun-scarred landscape what seems illusory is often most real.Nora has her own ghosts. “Thirty-seven years old and half-habited by the apparition of a child she had known for only five months”, she talks constantly to the spirit of her daughter, lost to heatstroke as a baby, while regretting the failed ideals that brought her family west. Out of Nora’s claustrophobia, her literal and metaphorical thirst – will she get a sip of water before the day is done? More importantly, will she find emotional release? – Obreht builds a narrative that is every bit as compelling as Lurie’s, and just as full of revelations. Their parallel journeys into Arizona’s inhospitable interior, “away from any graspable fact of life”, probe the cost of survival and the human yearning to belong. On every page gorgeously tinted images conjure the otherworldliness of this desert existence: mesas “banded over with ore and stuck about with newborn scrub” the fallen Alamo, “with its ruined steeples like the peaks cut off a mountainside” “a wrecked-out church the colour of blood hidden among the black cedars” a cluster of ghostly settler children “peering over the bluff, bright as falling stars”. And the camels, of course, rejoicing “in the fresh air and open sky, roaring, jostling, belching incredibly, dust-rolling, butting necks along wide laterals”. It’s the west, but not as we know it.Nora and Lurie are set on a collision course: will they meet? Obreht’s narrative skill here is part of the magic of Inland, which succeeds spectacularly at reinventing a well-worn genre and its tropes. There are no stereotypes in this western, only ferociously adroit writing that honours the true strangeness of reality in its search for the meaning of home.• Elizabeth Lowry’s Dark Water is published by Riverrun.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The problem was not a global problem, British Airways said.However, passengers were warned that the disruption would likely have knock-on effects at airports across the UK and Europe. British Airways flights were cancelled or delayed at airports in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast.Customers have experienced difficulties checking in online, while queues have formed in airport departure areas as staff struggled to check in passengers.The airline said it has moved to back-up manual systems to keep some flights operating. As well as check-in, some systems allowing aircraft to depart were affected.Air travel experts said the airline may be liable to pay compensation to affected passengers, on top of refunding them the ticket price. Under EU law, some passengers whose flights are cancelled or delayed by two hours or more can be given compensation.British Airways said it was offering customers the chance to move bookings to another travel day between 8-13 August.About half of the British Airways flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow’s terminal 5 between 9.30am and midday were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport’s website.In a statement, the airline said: “We are working as quickly as possible to resolve a systems issue which has resulted in some short-haul cancellations and delays from London airports.“A number of flights continue to operate but we are advising customers to check ba for the latest flight information before coming to the airport.”British Airways flights had already been among the 177 flights cancelled and then reinstated on Monday and Tuesday in preparation for industrial action by staff at Heathrow over low pay. The strikes, originally due to be begin at midnight on Monday morning, were suspended to allow further talks between union and airport officials.British Airways has in the past suffered severe computer system failures that have left passengers stranded around the world. In 2017 during the May bank holiday weekend some 75,000 passengers were stranded at Gatwick and Heathrow. The latest delays come after almost 200 passengers were evacuated from a British Airways flight to Valencia on Monday because of smoke filling the cabin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d07dcf10a3f2a81a012fb33a3743540b1684be66/0_0_5862_3519/master/5862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff11dd7e41948fc784f6ba79182a37da","title":"northern ireland hard border brexit customs","story":"The customs checkpoint at the end of my garden is now a family home a hard border in Ireland is simply unworkableOne consequence of the brain’s incredible ability to make sense of the world is that it sometimes sees things that aren’t there. Most people have experienced pareidolia, that pleasing effect of interpreting a face from a random assortment of objects or shapes, so that a paperclip and two blobs of adhesive putty look like a happy little man, or the watermarks behind Auntie Maureen’s radiator strike her as a dead ringer for the Virgin Mary. Our brain has spent so many millions of years geared toward facial recognition, it takes even the most random nonsense and attempts to construct it into something meaningful.My brain, it turns out, does a similar thing when I read the tweets of Brexit MEP Ben Habib. “I am on the border between NI and ROI,” he tweeted last week, above a video that depicted him and some colleagues wisely playing in the middle of the road. “Travelling in a straight line, one enters and exits the ROI a number of times. There could never be a hard border here. The UK has declared it would never seek to impose one. The whole thing is a red herring.”Surely, I thought, this was a pleasing moment of candour from a man who had seen just how unworkable a border would be, who had stood where it once was, and realised that such a self-defeating arrangement must never be put in place again.Alas, this hope was no more real than Auntie Maureen’s blotchy patch of Blessed-Virgin-shaped damp. Habib’s point was, astoundingly, that a no-deal Brexit was somehow incapable of causing a hard border because … it would be inconvenient to erect? Or because there isn’t one there currently? Perhaps Habib thinks the world is just full of things now, and new things can’t be built in spaces where those things don’t currently exist. One wonders what it would be like to watch Grand Designs with him, to feel his innocent thrill at the impossibility of these wondrous structures as they miraculously appear in places were once they weren’t. Of course, it’s hard to know exactly what he meant, or whence came the ebullience with which he meant it since, again, my brain is working overtime to ascribe sense where none exists.I don’t know much about Habib’s little border crossing jaunt I do hope he had a nice time, perhaps returning home with some agricultural diesel or a few nice boxty recipes. But I do know quite a bit about the hard border which, for 80 years, existed between the UK and Ireland. Because that’s where I was born and raised.My family home is on Derry’s western border with Donegal. I mean “on” here quite literally. For most of my childhood, our garden backed on to a UK customs checkpoint which sat at the terminus of land behind our garage. I’m sure this isn’t some red herring I’ve imagined, because I’d have likely conjured a more thrilling sight than the squat little prefab that blighted our view of the main road until 1997. On the other hand, however fevered my imagination, I doubt I could have made up the time an IRA bomb blast destroyed that building, damaging our windows and blowing a section of its wall into our field – with its kitchen sink still attached.I’ve lived on the hard border and faced some small part of the harm it can do to a place. It takes a certain lack of seriousness to say that something is impossible just because it has never happened before. It takes an altogether different level of ineptitude to say a thing is impossible, when it only very recently stopped happening, having done so for eight decades before that.The hard border is not currently there because of its relaxation under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, underpinned by the fact that both the UK and Ireland are EU states. If Britain leaves with no deal, we will have an international border between two entities with disparate health regulations, tax schemes and immigration policies, meaning it will need to be fortified once more. You might say this concept is what gives both words within the term “international border” their meaning. It would be odd if we were merely having to point this out to those who, admirably enough, advocate pulling down the barriers between nations. But we are here explaining the concept of borders to the very people who have been screaming we need greater control of them for decades, and who wish to crash out of the world’s most successful trading bloc largely because of the people who come through those borders.But it gets better. After the Good Friday agreement, the customs hut was sold so that a large family home could be built in its place. The couple who live there are extremely nice but I’m sure they would object to having a customs outpost erected in their bedroom. They have also shown remarkably little interest in working for HMRC as checkpoint guards. My dad says they’re into walking their dog, mostly. The building immediately next door is in the Republic of Ireland, and was formerly the Irish customs post. It’s now a kickboxing gym. There has never been even a cursory inquiry into purchasing these buildings and refitting them for their former purposes. There’s 300 miles (482km) of border. That’s a lot of family homes, petrol stations, cow sheds and kickboxing gyms. While I will admit I quite like the thought of some pencil-necked bureaucrat having to evict a gym filled with oiled-up Derry and Donegal martial artists, doing so across Northern Ireland would be the most expensive and logistically arduous engineering, staffing and planning job in UK or Irish history. It would take a great deal more than 85 days and £2.1bn. And it would still be a bad idea even if it promised a massively improved economy and huge social improvements, rather than a harrowing wasteland of dead diabetics, bleached chicken and Dominic Raab.It’s hard to know what Habib and the Brexit commentariat are aiming for, except borders that are stronger, more impenetrable and back under Britain’s Control™ while also being open, invisible and as frictionless as those we currently have. We may have to make peace with the fact they don’t even know themselves. No matter how hard we look, the nonsense of their position is staring us in the face.• Séamas O’Reilly is a writer from Derry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb04f125b3d22ccf4262d0be8e3516b5037f6302/0_465_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c36ad374c68d1a0b7bcbc50a670e2b0b","title":"post referendum britain royals progressive meghan markle","story":"I’ve been asking strangers random questions for 20 years in the name of journalism, but I’d never been vox-popped myself until last Friday, when I was approached on Oxford Street by someone from a Japanese television station. What did I think of Meghan Markle?I said I thought she was great. Furthermore (warming to my theme), I thought the reaction against her in the British media was symptomatic of a deeply disturbing moment of racist hegemony that has crashed over us like sewage, following the dam burst of Brexit.Yes, I admit there was quite a cock-eyed, irrigation-system riff going on in that metaphor, and I must have been talking for about 15 minutes, but they wanted more. What did I think of the cover stars Markle chose for her guest editorship of Vogue? The list had already had some hostile attention in the press, which is why they were asking. The princess’s heroines included Greta Thunberg, Jane Fonda, novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and actor Jameela Jamil. It was glitzy but it was political, and most of the confected rage seemed to centre on the fact that she hadn’t chosen the Queen. I thought Meghan’s list was great I think she’s great. Unnervingly, I think the royals are great.If you dwell too hard on how things used to be, it becomes surreal: the royal family have typically been seen, by the forces of progress, as part of the apparatus of the status quo. With their unearned wealth, and protected by inscrutable silence, they shored up and symbolised the entitled establishment more trenchantly than anyone could by making a speech. It’s true that the staunch republicanism of your average leftie in the 1970s and 80s faded in the callow 90s, when it simply wasn’t cool to worry about privilege. But even as many anti-monarchists turned to other issues, none could have ever imagined standing on the same side of the barricades as the royals. Yet here we are. “The Queen won’t accept that,” people say sagely to one another, as another hard-right ideologue floats the possibility of proroguing parliament to crash Britain out of the European Union.The thrust of the attacks on Markle’s Vogue editorship – condemning it as virtue-signalling of the worst kind, as Hollywood self-aggrandisement shoving its hypocritical values down our throats – was a variation on the theme: “Get back in your box, princess.”It is typical of the age that anyone allying themselves with an optimistic vision – what if we could avert climate catastrophe? What if we stamped out prejudice? – is immediately greeted with this kind of ire. The mean-spirited arguments are constructed on a foundation of bad faith. Only the underprivileged can talk about privilege only the excluded can talk about bigotry only the monk can talk about consumption. The ploy is quite clear: virtually nobody counts as quite deprived enough to have ambitions for a better world, so everybody should just pipe down. It’s like some infuriating riddle, devised by Breitbart and recycled on the pages of once-respectable newspapers. Ultimately the targets are more interesting than the impoverished arguments themselves.Why would it be Markle who riles them like this? Kate Middleton, when she first married into the royal family, chose as one of her charities a women’s addiction rehab centre called Hope House. Did anyone jump up and down about that? Could it be anything to do with Markle’s race, this constant provocation she seems to present to people who hate being called racist?It is an uncomfortable thought experiment to imagine Prince Harry explaining the mainstream British media to his relatively new wife: “Look, the tabloids have never been great. They hounded my mother to an early grave with their insatiable scrutiny. But as bad as the treatment of my mother was, it would have been unimaginable that weird, misogynist rumours such as ‘she’s faking her pregnancy’ would circulate in the darkest recesses of the blogosphere. The mainstream British media has suffered some catastrophic bypass of decency that may or may not be related to your race.”Even with such a sober account of the facts, Harry would be placing himself considerably to the left of that mainstream. There’s no evidence to suggest that he is left wing at all. But he too has been pilloried by the self-appointed scourges of political correctness over his foregrounding of the climate emergency. The royals haven’t moved, but the political context in which they are now operating has shifted so far that merely through anti-racist advocacy, or trusting in science, they’ve fetched up on the same team as the socialists. References to the “Overton window” don’t really do justice to the changing political parameters that have turned our royal family into a stronghold of progressive thinking in modern Britain. The lexicon of political analysis needs a new gloss the Overton hall of mirrors, the Overton trapdoor.The royals have become potential allies in the rebellion against lunacy. Could the prime minister really refuse to resign following a vote of no confidence, and use the lack of precedent and fog of chaos to force through a no-deal Brexit? “Oh, the Queen would never have it.” We hope. “She’d be bound to intervene. She loves the constitution. It’s her favourite thing, after the Commonwealth.” We envisage the monarch intervening with sound sense, while Prince William goes on a Pride march and Prince Charles gives Davos a piece of his mind about carbon emissions.Some of it is wishful thinking, but there’s a truth at its heart. English nativism, in all its petty media iterations, has turned the royal family into renegades. To explain that to a Japanese television channel would have been the work of a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d0b275be96fc94f793eb55349124d27e5c920f/51_0_5215_3129/master/5215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a148c41b4f550614f707644b1718ed8","title":"parents devastated by closure of bristol special needs school","story":"Children ‘traumatised’ by sudden closure of St Christopher’s over safeguarding concernsParents have expressed their devastation at the sudden closure of a special needs residential school in Bristol, which left their children – who have severe and complex learning difficulties – distraught and without suitable alternative placements.Parents were called at work and summoned to pick up their children from St Christopher’s – an independent special school and care home in Westbury Park in the north of the city – after the schools’ regulator Ofsted suspended its registration because of safeguarding concerns.Police have confirmed they are investigating allegations of child cruelty and a number of staff have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. However, parents are furious at the way the closure was handled, with little warning or apparent forethought.Parents were handed their children’s belongings in black binbags, while some children were bussed to emergency placements around the country. Other parents, who have not lived with their children for years due to their extreme, challenging behaviour, had no choice but to take them home.One parent described witnessing an “auction”, as alternative providers selected pupils they were willing to take on while rejecting others. Some parents said they were having to give up work to look after their children others said their children had been traumatised by the experience and had regressed.“I feel they have left the children in a more vulnerable position than if they would have stayed there,” said James Cole, whose 13-year-old son Jacob has lived at St Christopher’s for a year and a half. “To just pull the plug without any due care to the lives of those children is unbelievable.”Jacob, who has autism, epilepsy and displays challenging behaviour, is now at home while his parents struggle to find an alternative place. “St Christopher’s was quite unique in that it took so many children with so many complexities because they had such good services there. It’s hard to find that replicated elsewhere.”Cole said it took months of careful investigations for parents with children like Jacob to find suitable placements, which can cost around £300,000 a year. Yet the sudden closure of St Christopher’s meant some children were moved elsewhere in hours. “It was absolutely dreadful,” he said.One mother, who asked to remain anonymous, described seeing her 15-year-old son lying on the grass sobbing, his carers lying alongside, cuddling him and crying too. “These poor children. It’s had a massive impact on them,” she said.Her son is now at home, which will have an enormous impact on family life. “He is very stressed. He is going to miss all the really good carers who looked after him. He had an amazing team around him. We will not let our son go anywhere else now.”Other parents are having to contemplate travelling huge distances to find a suitable placement. “We live in Bath and we’ve been offered a place in Northumberland or Shrewsbury,” said Kevin Maxwell, whose 16-year-old son, Jonah, is one of the 27 pupils moved out of St Christopher’s last week.An Ofsted spokesperson said St Christopher’s was inspected in June and judged to be inadequate. The inspection related to the residential part of the provision, rather than the school. “On Monday 29 July, we issued St Christopher’s with a suspension of registration notice because of serious concerns about safeguarding.”Avon and Somerset police confirmed: “We’re investigating allegations of child cruelty offences relating to a special education school in the north Bristol area. We’re working with our multi-agency partners to ensure that safeguarding measures are being put in place and Ofsted has been notified. Parents have been contacted. Some members of staff have been suspended while our investigation continues.”In 2016 St Christopher’s was threatened with closure because it had become economically unviable and was taken over by the Aurora Group, a private company specialising in special education care. An Aurora spokeswoman said: “We are deeply concerned about the serious allegations against a small number of staff who were immediately suspended,” a spokesperson said.“They were reported to the authorities straight away in line with our safeguarding procedures. We are now focused on doing all that we can to support the children, young people, their families and carers, and the many caring and dedicated staff who are affected during this difficult time.”Dr Jacqui Jensen, executive director of people services at Bristol city council, which is one of the local authorities responsible for pupils at the schools, said: “We are working with the families, other local authorities and a range of partners to review everyone’s inidual care plans and make alternative arrangements for the provision of care and education.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b07a4d795bc4ba68449bddc798164d0d0c71ca/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e3d72e7814090d2739019abe280016","title":"whaley bridge dam reconstruction could take years locals told","story":"News comes as some evacuated residents are told they will be able to return homeIt could take years to reconstruct the damaged dam above the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge, residents have been told, as some of the 1,500 evacuated were promised that they would now be allowed to return to their homes.At a community meeting, Derbyshire police said that residents of one part of the town could begin to go back to the village after water levels in Toddbrook reservoir dropped rapidly. But some still face waiting until after a Wednesday inspection to be certain that their homes are absolutely safe.A spokesman for the Environment Agency at the meeting in nearby Chapel-en-le-Firth said that it was hard to know how long the reconstruction of the dam would take.“We are very much in the emergency phase now and we are currently repairing and carrying out construction work,” he said. “It is a long-term construction project, but we will not have started from scratch. It could take 18 months, two years, three years, who knows?”Rachel Swann, deputy chief constable of Derbyshire police, told the meeting that residents of the Horwich End area could return home.“I have got a meeting at 12pm tomorrow where I am expecting we will have good news,” she said. “We have obviously been pumping the water out and it has gone down at a fast speed. It is now beyond 9.5 metres. We will keep draining the water until it is safe to stop.”Earlier emergency crews who had pumped 1.2m tonnes of water from the damaged reservoir were told they had reached their target.The Canal and River Trust had said it needed to drop the water level by eight metres and confirmed the level was now down to 8.4 metres.The trust said: “The water has been pumped out at a controlled rate and good progress is being made.”Nonetheless, Derbyshire fire and rescue service urged caution after residents were given false hope of being able to return to their homes.In response to a tweet saying “the dam is considered safe”, the fire service said: “Nowhere have we said that the dam is safe now. Work is ongoing, and road closures and evacuations are still in place to preserve life.“We will open roads and let people return home as soon as we can, but we have no way of knowing when this will be.”Fire crews have been using dozens of high-volume pumps to remove the reservoir’s water since part of its spillway collapsed on Thursday afternoon following days of heavy rainfall.As residents were evacuated an RAF Chinook helicopter was drafted in and began to drop hundreds of bags of sand and aggregate to shore up the slipped pieces of concrete.Since then seven tonnes of water a minute have been pumped out of the structure, built in 1831, drastically lowering the threat of flooding across the valley down towards the towns and villages of the High Peak.The water taken out of the reservoir has been directed into a sluice channel before being dropped into the River Goyt. The Environment Agency confirmed it was monitoring water levels in the river.Meanwhile, work on the damaged dam was hampered by subsidence overnight. Tonnes of gravel and stone that had been loaded into the damaged section of the dam since Friday had “settled” resulting in the Chinook returning and dropping a further 50 tonnes of aggregate to repair the area.Previously police and local authorities criticised around 31 residents who decided to stay in their homes within the evacuation zone, saying they were “taking their lives into their own hands” and jeopardising the safety of the emergency services.Malcolm Venton and Lorraine Ellis told the  they could not leave their two border collies, Meg and Amy. The couple were asked to leave on Saturday when the evacuation zone was extended, but decided to hunker down, despite the threat of a huge wave rushing out of the reservoir."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02eba4cb1839d09a4a5ce3aab7954a39f31e5ed9/332_556_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a1be19aee90e39c02adc906f1d9e35","title":"farmer produces ethical king prawns in a lincolnshire field","story":"Most warm water prawns sold in UK are imported from Asia and are tainted with allegations of slavery and environmental destructionAt a farm in Lincolnshire two aquaculturists are busy feeding thousands of larvae in a dozen large tanks designed to emulate a seawater environment.This is the UK’s first warm water king prawn producer. In less than three and a half months, each wriggling little creature will grow to weigh 30g, ready to be harvested and sold to retailers and restaurants. FloGro Fresh is the first company in Britain to bring Pacific whiteleg prawns fresh to the market – most prawns consumed in the UK are imported frozen from India, Vietnam, Thailand, Ecuador or Honduras.In an industry rife with human trafficking and modern slavery, and notorious for its destruction of marine ecosystems, FloGro is one farmer’s attempt to produce farmed prawns that are sustainable and ethical.“The beauty of our operation is that it’s entirely fresh, everything that comes from overseas has been frozen,” said Ralph Maxwell, FloGro’s managing director.The team at FloGro “get the order in the morning, go and harvest it immediately from the tank and they’re shipped to the customer overnight and will be in the restaurant the following day. So in less than 24 hours you have that order.”“They know exactly where it comes from,” he added. “There is provenance and there is traceability to everything we do, so if the customer or chef wants to come and see it they can come up and see the prawn. We don’t know where the prawns come from in southeast Asia, but I’m told they come from very dubious places.”The Marine Conservation Society has given a thumbs up to FloGro’s methods of production and sustainability. Its closed-loop aquaculture system uses renewable energy – a combination of rooftop solar panels and wind power from Lincolnshire.750 cubic metres of water, heated via a biomass boiler fed with wood pellets to ensure it remains at 28C (82F) at all times, is filtered and recycled robustly. Prawn poo is spread on land as fertiliser.A major issue with intensive prawn farming in places like Asia is the use of polluting chemicals and antibiotics. According to the Environmental Justice Foundation, “the production of prawns can be responsible for serious environmental degradation, such as the destruction of mangroves, wetlands and coral reefs, destruction of marine and coastal bioersity and mass drowning of sea turtles and other protected species. It has also been linked to human rights abuses, such as child, forced and bonded labour, intimidation, violence and even murder.”Neil Campbell, head chef at Yotam Ottolenghi’s Fitzrovia restaurant Rovi, said the restaurant’s relationship with the farm was key in choosing their product.FloGro receives a shipment of 150,000 larvae from the US every four to five weeks. Boxes containing baby shrimps in highly oxygenated pure seawater arrive at Heathrow. The larvae go through an acclimatisation period before being placed in blue tanks filled with salted water, known as nursery tanks. They stay there for 28 days, growing from 0.003g to 0.03g. Another 28 days are spent in six intermediary tanks where they grow to 2–3g each. They spend the rest of their lives in 12 concrete “grow-out” tanks.In contrast with conventionally farmed prawns in Asia and Latin America, which are often fed with fishmeal obtained through illegal fishing, FloGro prawns are fed with fishmeal from France that is sourced from off-cuts from human consumption.“We’re not killing fish to put in our prawns, it’s only the waste product from human consumption,” said production manager Richard Clarke. Born in Lincolnshire, Clarke studied aquaculture and fisheries management and is now one of two full-time staff on the farm. Two part-timers help at the weekend.The prawns are harvested twice a week. They stop feeding 24 hours before so the back vein is empty when they are harvested, making life easier for chefs. The prawns die instantly when put into iced water. They are then vacuum-packed and kept chilled until they are ready to be delivered. They cost £20 per kilo.Maxwell said the response to the British prawns has been overwhelming. “Our problem is that we can’t supply enough,” he said. The company is now focusing on setting up its own hatchery to increase production.FloGro, set up in 2015, is also looking at ways to sell an important byproduct of the prawn shells: chitosan, which can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Every two to three weeks, prawns shed their shells.“A lot of restaurants have stopped selling imported prawns because they don’t know where they come from,” said Maxwell. “The consumer drives the marketplace and is becoming far more sophisticated. They want to know where the prawn has come from, so that’s a big plus for us. That is why there is a potential to grow our industry in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3ec418a81183c113aaad075276cd924f365598f/0_310_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b343e58db8956de41626c567eeb80ab","title":"stare seagulls out to save your snacks researcher says","story":"Giving marauding birds the eye makes them more wary of stealing food, study findsThey attack in a blur of white and grey. In an instant, a pleasant day at the beach is transformed into a Hitchcockian nightmare of screams, pecks and flapping wings. Before the victim knows what hit them, their sausage roll is no more.Now scientists have come up with a simple defence against the menace of food-snatching seagulls. Extensive tests in Cornish towns have found a chink in the bold birds’ armour. They back off from your snacks if you stare them out.Madeleine Goumas, a postgraduate researcher at Exeter University, ventured to Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and other popular seaside spots armed with a sealed bag of chips and a stopwatch. When she arrived, she placed the chips about an arm’s length away and timed when the seagulls swooped.For half the tests Goumas looked away, pretending not to notice the marauding birds, but for rest she locked eyes with the gulls to see if they would have second thoughts. According to her study, published in Biology Letters, eye contact made the birds nervy.“We found that they are less likely to approach food when they are being watched,” Goumas said. “Sometimes they would jump and stop dead when they realised they were being watched.” Others, meanwhile, skirted the food or meandered around in elaborate paths as if choosing a moment to strike.“The effect was clearer with some iniduals than others,” Goumas said. “For the most part the gulls were wary of me when I was watching them, but there were a few iniduals that were quick to approach even when I was looking at them.”Food-snatching seagulls have terrorised seaside towns for decades, but as the birds move on to more urban centres, there is a need for better defences. Scarborough council opted for building nets, but others have been more inventive. Some cafes have armed clients with water pistols, while the garden at a Wetherspoons pub in Exeter will soon be patrolled by a bird of prey.Last month, Alan Amos, a Conservative councillor and the mayor of Worcester city council, proposed a more drastic strategy. Amid tales of pensioners being pecked, and the apparent snatching of Gizmo the chihuahua from his owner’s back garden in Paignton, Devon, Amos told The Sun it was time for a cull. “We must kill the bloody things,” he said.Goumas favours another approach. “When we do see gulls snatching food from people they tend to come from behind and the people they take food from usually have no idea it is about to happen,” she said. “People can take steps to prevent it. When you eat, being against a wall that blocks a gull’s access from behind, or just keeping an eye out, being more vigilant, reduces your chances of having your food taken.”“If people can take small steps to try and reduce the conflict that would be really beneficial for everyone. Gulls are being vilified. Some people really don’t like them because of behaviours like this, but actually it looks like very few gulls are bold enough to take food from people,” Goumas said.Dr Viola Ross-Smith at the British Trust for Ornithology has worked extensively with seagulls and has witnessed the full suite of strategies the birds use to deter a threatening presence. “They have e-bombed me, screamed at me, regurgitated and defecated. It’s not glamorous work,” she said. “But in my experience, if you look at the gulls, they either stay on the ground and look back at you or back off.”The birds are probably more cautious when humans make eye contact because they realise they are at risk of being attacked, Ross-Smith said. She agreed that the most canny food-snatching gulls seem to attack from behind. “It’s terrible to admit, but I quite enjoy watching gulls do that,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2852a0d9675e7c585c4723b0dcacd1cd497c6736/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffbf0a0916b8516d2613ac4b596e9e1f","title":"tottenham prepare 644m bid for juventuss paulo dybala","story":"Tottenham are preparing a €70m (£64.4m) bid for Juventus’s Paulo Dybala and have also been offered the chance to sign Barcelona’s Coutinho on loan.The Serie A club are willing to consider the sale of the talented but inconsistent Argentinian but are holding out for around £70m for the 25-year-old. A much bigger problem for Spurs would be to agree personal terms with Dybala.The Argentinian is earning more than £300,000 a week at Juventus before tax and would not want to earn less at Spurs. A further complication is his image rights, which are expensive, as well as agents’ fees of up to £12m.Spurs are also one of the clubs who have been sounded out on whether they would be interested in signing Philippe Coutinho on loan. The Brazilian is considering a move away from Barcelona for the new season and the player’s representatives have made contact with several clubs, including Arsenal, to see whether there is any interest in the player who left Liverpool in January 2018 in a deal worth €142 million.Manchester United were also interested in signing Dybala this summer but walked away from the deal when the total cost became apparent. The Argentinian would prefer to stay at Juventus but the Italian champions are keen to offload him because of his high wages.The Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, is a huge admirer of Dybala but he too realises that it will be very difficult to get a deal over the line before Thursday’s deadline.Tottenham would have to sell Christian Eriksen, possibly to Manchester United, in order to finance the Dybala deal. Eriksen has just one year left on his contract and could leave for free next summer. Juventus are not interested in signing the Dane as any part of a deal for Dybala.Spurs have already broken their transfer record this summer with the signing of Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon for £55.5m. Despite this, Pochettino recently said that his job title should change from manager to coach as he has very little input into transfers.“The club need to change my title and description. Of course I am the boss deciding the strategic play, but in another area I don’t know. Today, I feel like I am the coach.”Tottenham start their Premier League campaign against Aston Villa on Saturday.

No matter the size of United’s summer splurge – and the Blades have spent more in the past four weeks than in the previous 14 years – nothing will overshadow the importance of keeping hold of a manager who has masterminded the club’s rise from League One to the Premier League in three seasons.It has been a swift ascension for the club but a long road for their manager. Of the five men taking charge of Premier League teams for the first time this weekend – Wilder, Dean Smith, Graham Potter, Frank Lampard and Daniel Farke – Wilder has had by far the lengthiest apprenticeship. The 51-year-old is closing in on 1,000 games as a manager (not counting his time coaching Bradway FC in the Meadowhall Sunday League), the majority coming in six-year spells with Halifax Town and Oxford United.The Blades were ailing when he returned as manager in the summer of 2016, and under Nigel Adkins had just registered their lowest league finish since 1982 – 11th in League One. The turnaround has been nothing short of astonishing and it is not an exaggeration to suggest that United have never had a manager so universally adored, inside the club and on the terraces. Perhaps only Dave Bassett comes close.Bassett’s big-money signing of the summer after he guided the Blades into the top flight in 1990 was John Pemberton, at £300,000 an upgrade on the right-back who had played much of the promotion campaign – one Chris Wilder. Neil Warnock didn’t exactly splash the cash when he took United up in 2006. Wilder, though, has found the purse strings a little looser.The key arrivals have been in attacking areas. The summer’s first new record signing was Luke Freeman – one of the Championship’s best attacking midfielders over the past four seasons – who arrived from QPR for about £4m. Callum Robinson, hugely impressive with Preston last year, arrived for roughly twice that and Lys Mousset’s £10m arrival from Bournemouth trumped them both.On Friday the striker Oli McBurnie joined from Swansea for £17.5m, taking the summer spree to over £40m. This is entirely new territory for the club. Nevertheless there’s an element of risk in all four. Freeman, Robinson and McBurnie are well established Championship talents the question is whether they can thrive at the higher level (the same applies to the midfielder Ben Osborn, a £3m arrival from Nottingham Forest). It is not a dissimilar approach to that taken by the club after their promotion to the Championship in 2017, looking to take the best talents from the ision below and hoping they can make the step up.Mousset, on the other hand, has 58 Premier League appearances, though they translate to only 1,191 minutes in total. Wilder will back himself to unlock the potential of a player who piqued the interest of Arsenal and Tottenham as a teenager at Le Havre.Speaking of untapped potential, perhaps United’s most intriguing signing is that of Ravel Morrison. The lament is pretty familiar by now – the star of Manchester United’s 2011 FA Youth Cup side that included Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, the most talented youngster Sir Alex Ferguson had seen since Paul Scholes, a player with so much ability that Barcelona, Chelsea and Arsenal mulled over taking a gamble even when ill-discipline and attitude had seen United wash their hands of him … and an itinerant career that has never delivered on his teenage talent. Wilder has specialised in confounding expectations. Getting a tune out of Morrison would be up there with the most surprising.The former Lazio, Atlas and Östersund (and Queens Park Rangers and West Ham and Birmingham) midfielder will likely act as something of a plan B, with Freeman at the tip of the midfield triangle if United stick to the 3-4-1-2 that served them so well in the Championship. That would enable the use of their overlapping centre-backs (it seems cavalier yet the Blades had the joint-best defensive record in the Championship), a tactic that proved hugely effective in the promotion campaign.Perhaps more likely, given the increased standard of opposition, Wilder may opt for a flat back four, as he did on a few occasions last season. Either way the defence will have a familiar look. John Egan and Jack O’Connell were the bedrock and will be so again, joined by either Chris Basham or the returning Phil Jagielka if they play in a three.Jagielka’s return, 12 years on from his exit to Everton, may owe something to sentiment (in United’s last Premier League season he scored a 91st-minute screamer against Middlesbrough to secure their first win then cemented himself in United folklore by playing in goal and keeping Arsenal at bay at Bramall Lane in a chaotic, adrenaline-soaked 1-0 win that was undoubtably the high point of the campaign) but he also brings Premier League experience and knowhow – few others in the squad have played more than a handful of top-flight games.Behind the backline the England Under-21s goalkeeper Dean Henderson has rejoined on loan from Manchester United, a vital addition that initially appeared a formality but took a little longer than Wilder would have liked. Henderson will have the opportunity to force himself into senior contention at Old Trafford and possibly even with Gareth Southgate’s side. He’s certainly likely to be busy enough.George Baldock and Enda Stevens will be either the wing-backs or full-backs depending on how ambitious Wilder is feeling, while John Fleck and Ollie Norwood will provide the ballast in central midfield, with Norwood finally getting a chance in the Premier League after two promotions to the top flight with Fulham and Brighton but no games to show for it.Billy Sharp and David McGoldrick, last season’s leading scorers, may face a battle for game time among the signings but Wilder has shown in the past he is not a manager who puts much stock in reputation or price tag. If the stalwarts prove more effective than the new arrivals, then they’ll spearhead what in all likelihood will be a difficult battle for survival.To survive they’ll have to break a trend. United’s last two seasons in the Premier League – in 1993-94 and 2006-07 – ended in agonising final-day relegation when on both occasions they had their fate in their own hands. But past pain hasn’t quelled optimism – the club have reported record season-ticket sales and Bramall Lane is likely to be sold out for most of the season. Why so cheery? Perhaps because fans have seen the full extent of the Wilder effect at close quarters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949b09bc3536a596eae6399bc2a28c651ebc7955/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a94ea20255de8deb93b1582fee63dc48","title":"50 great tracks for august from taylor swift kano jenny hval and more","story":"Swift delivers her most personal song yet, while gospel and church organs keep the faith in this month’s roundup of new music – read about our 10 favourite tracks belowby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesBack in February, Taylor Swift wrote for Elle about the importance of specificity in pop songs: “We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ‘This is what I went through’ as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles,” she declared. Strangely, then, the first songs from her forthcoming seventh album Lover didn’t really do that – ME! and You Need to Calm Down had anthemic, outward-facing intentions, celebrating weirdness and telling bigots to wind it in. But The Archer does: looking deeply inwards, it might be the most personal and self-lacerating song Swift has ever released. She sounds wearied by her self-professed immaturity (“I never grew up  It’s getting so old”) and self-defeatist tendencies (“I cut off my nose just to spite my face  Then I hate my reflection for years and years”), conflicted by her roles as predator and victim. It’s not a proper single – there’s no headline-grabbing video – and the production is low-key, just a blooming Chromatics-y synth glow that builds but never breaks, so it’s had a quieter reception than Lover’s first two singles. But it’s a small, sincere marvel. LSKano was one of the great breakthroughs of grime’s first wave with tracks like P’s and Q’s, and showed major ambition with albums that also straddled R\u0026ampB, jungle and hip-hop. Like fellow originators Skepta and Wiley, he too had a fallow period – 2010 flop Method to the Madnesss – before hurtling back with renewed vigour, for 2016’s Made in the Manor, his best album yet. A pair of new tracks suggest the follow-up could be even better. A little like Strangers from his previous album, Trouble uses piano and sparse drums, giving Kano space to plead for an end to cyclical gang violence. “You ever seen a mother’s tears run down Gucci glasses?”, he asks, criticising both the violence itself and the peacocking consumerism that partly powers it in a single line. But he encourages rather than scolds, and gives short shrift to politicians who would do the latter: “These gunshots never reach your town”. The result is a moving, charismatic UK twist on the gospel rap of Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. BBTThere’s a great tradition of meta songs, the kind where musicians sing about an imagined song that becomes real through their writing. Norwegian pop experimentalist Jenny Hval is great at this sort of conceptual summoning – and somehow, in Ashes to Ashes, she doesn’t just make a dreamed song real, but turns it into a chilling meditation on mortality and the fragile boundaries between permanence and transience. A friend dreams about burying someone’s ashes then having a cigarette Hval dreams about digging her own grave and it being like playing an instrument about sexual fantasy as a form of suffocation. That would all be hard work if not for how light Ashes to Ashes is, a pulsing, clubbing pop gem that, like her theme, seems to hover between reality and reverie. LSThe production of Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens’ killer collaboration – courtesy of PC Music’s AG Cook, and someone called Ö – sounds like fists battering against a locked door, a frenzied plea for escape. Both Charli and Chris have talked about battling the closed-minded limitations of the industry by coming together, they liberate each other and push pop further into the future. In Gone, they reject an indifferent, fickle scene (“pour me one more  watch the ice melt in my fist” might be Charli’s best lyric yet) and then forge their own private language. What does it mean to “keep when the water runs”? I don’t know, but it’s the kind of idiosyncratic linguistic quirk that pop magic is made from. That “keep” repeats and fragments through the rest of the song, a battering ram of persistence and self-possession that drives their liberation home (a feat made clearer in the superb video, where Chris frees Charli from bondage and they have a majestic dance-off on top of a car in the rain). LSThis startlingly beautiful 10-piece K-pop boyband is actually one of four subsets of an overall 21-member group, NCT, and while it’s easy to be cynical about the reasoning underpinning this setup – four lots of merch to flog to obsessive fans! – it’s much harder to resist the charms of new single Highway to Heaven. The English-language lyrics rather make you long for Korean, particularly the rapping (“Skrrt, pull up in the coupe, beep-beep”), but the spectacular chorus and soft-rock verses make this a kind of Boys of Summer 2019. Also of note in K-pop this month is Baekhyun, whose versatile voice winds jazzily through the snapping rap production on mini-album City Lights. BBTSam Smith and Max Martin bounce back from the precipice of irrelevance with this sublime “I’m not angry, just disappointed” club heartbreaker, all trap beats and dramatic bassy slurs. Smith’s lover is a liar who’s making him crazy. He swears he’ll leave, no longer able to recognise himself, but not entirely cheated of his optimism: “I’m hoping that my love will keep you up tonight,” he says, clinging on to the promise that there’s nobility in devotion. Critics have whispered about Sam Smith in the same breath as George Michael before, but this sophisticated, assured comeback is the first time he’s truly lived up to the comparison. LSThe standout from the latest Africa Express sessions in Johannesburg pairs Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner with Ugandan electro acholi star Otim Alpha, London producer Georgia and South African vocal harmony group Mahotella Queens. Georgia takes the vocal lead, singing with sweet determination about Hilda Tloubatla leaving her township to join the Mahotella Queens in 1960s Johannesburg, the city hustle and bustle reflected in Alpha’s darkly glittering, pumping production. LSAnchored by a remarkable drummer, this seven-piece British post-punk band may only have released one song so far but are playing the kind of thrilling gigs it takes others months of touring to work up to. Their second release, the nine-minute Sunglasses, sets out their stall: skronky brass and a Tortoise-ish groove shift up a gear to hurtle into a wildly strident climax. Throughout, vocalist Isaac Wood has a series of vivid visions: a confrontation with privilege and conservatism brought on by his mum juicing watermelons in a Nutribullet feeling invincible behind a pair of sunglasses on a crowded street a lover telling him to “fuck me like you mean it” and screaming at him: “Leave Kanye out of this!” Funny, vivid and anthemic. BBTOne of the richest troves in the reissues market in recent years has been gospel music made in the middle of the 20th century. Numero Group’s exceptional three-part Good God! series, Honest Jon’s compilation Christians Catch Hell, Mississippi Records’ Life is a Problem and many others have excavated songs that burn with Christian fervour, the artists’ faith giving their music a certain keen feeling that secular music can never match. Next up is Luaka Bop’s The Time For Peace Is Now, released on 13 September, and this track from it is a truly valuable find: a lo-fi but full-bodied soul backing lifts the tearjerkingly beautiful chorus to the heavens. BBTThe church organ has become an instrument of endless fascination to a set of young, primarily female composers: Kara-Lis Coverdale, Ellen Arkbro, Sarah Davachi, Anna Von Hausswolff and others have all built their work around its stately ambient chords. Stockholm-based US composer Kali Malone has worked with all kinds of digital and analogue drones in the past but for new album The Sacrificial Code she solely uses a church organ, closely miked so as to remove any sense of the building it’s in, and “stripped of gestural adornments and spontaneous expressive impulse”. She uses this austerity to achieve transcendence, zooming into sound at an almost microscopic level: on Rose Wreath Crown (For CW) you can feel the waves of bass vibrating off each other. Her minimalist approach also means that when an emotive chord change arrives, it’s all the more gut-punching.

We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy.”McDonnell admitted Labour was split on the issue, but implied the UK leadership agreed. “There are other views within the party, but that’s our view,” he said.Under section 30 of the Scotland Act, Holyrood could only hold one if it is given the power to do so by the UK government.The Conservative government has repeatedly refused to give it such authority, but the Brexit crisis and the growing prospects of an early general election has brought the question to the fore.Jeremy Corbyn, the UK Labour leader and a close ally of McDonnell, has repeatedly wavered on the issue, but has said that if he became prime minister the party would “decide at the time” on whether to authorise a vote.Corbyn added, however: “We don’t want another referendum, we don’t think another referendum is a good idea, and we’ll be very clear on why we don’t think it’s a good idea.”McDonnell contradicted that stance, telling Dale: “It will be for the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide that. They will take a view about whether they want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or the beginning of 2021.“The Scottish parliament will come to a considered view on that and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself.”Ian Murray, a Scottish Labour MP and critic of independence and Corbyn, accused McDonnell of an “utterly irresponsible thoughtless rant” that betrayed the party’s values.“The Labour party is an internationalist party founded on a vision of solidarity and we should never seek to appease nationalists, whether they be for Brexit or Scottish independence, who want to ide communities and people,” he said.“John McDonnell has even bought into the nationalist narrative that Westminster is an ‘English parliament’, in an insult to the hard work carried out by Scottish MPs from every party.”Corbyn’s Scottish advisers have insisted he would not do a deal with the Scottish National party by offering them a second referendum in exchange for supporting a minority Labour government at Westminster. The SNP, however, are certain to put that on the table if Labour fails to win an overall majority.McDonnell said Labour would not do any deals with other parties, including the SNP. “I think we’d form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we’d expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don’t we’ll go back to the country.”According to those polling figures, it is highly unlikely Labour would win enough Scottish Westminster seats to command a Commons majority. Blocking a second referendum could cost Labour significant votes in Scotland, which may explain McDonnell’s new approach.His critics argue that supporting a new referendum will hand tens of thousands of unionist votes to the Scottish Tories, who will make opposition to independence the defining issue of their general election campaign.Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, responded to McDonnell’s remarks by tweeting:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9ed445d22b48201772757bc4033f8da6397b75/0_7_3731_2238/master/3731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac03df123c67314441d487aded99fba1","title":"michael gove accuses eu of refusing to negotiate new deal","story":"Ireland warns on relations as Boris Johnson’s government seems intent on no-deal departureMichael Gove has accused the European Union of intransigence over Brexit talks, calling it “wrong and sad”, as isions between the UK and Brussels became further entrenched with the government seemingly intent on a no-deal departure.Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, reiterated Boris Johnson’s position that the only route to progress would be the EU starting again with withdrawal negotiations, something Brussels has repeatedly and consistently ruled out.Adding to the impression of Johnson’s hardening position, newly released government read-outs of the prime minister’s phone calls with a series of EU leaders over recent days showed he delivered the same uncompromising message to them.While the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, insisted on Tuesday that a no-deal departure was not inevitable, both he and the country’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of a significant and long-term change to relations between the countries if it did happen.Downing Street has increasingly pushed the message that Brexit will happen on 31 October under any circumstances – even intimating that No 10 believes the mandate of the 2016 Brexit referendum would overrule even a blocking vote in parliament.There is increasing worry among some MPs that Johnson could try to force through a no-deal Brexit against the will of the Commons, with his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, reportedly threatening No 10 staff with the sack if they dissent.The government’s official position is still that it is seeking a formalised departure, albeit only if Brussels ditches the Irish backstop border insurance policy and reopens the withdrawal agreement.While the terms of the Brexit extension to 31 October made it plain neither could happen, Gove pushed the UK government’s view that if there is no deal it will be due to EU intransigence.“We need a new approach and we stand ready to engage with the European Union, to negotiate in good faith to make sure that we can have a friendly relationship in the future,” Gove said.“We will put all our energy into making sure that we can secure that good deal but at the moment it is the EU that seems to be saying they are not interested. They are simply saying: ‘No, we don’t want to talk.’ I think that is wrong and sad. It is not in Europe’s interests.”The official No 10 records of Johnson’s recent calls with EU leaders were similarly robust. In calls with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, Johnson said Theresa May’s old withdrawal agreement must be scrapped.In conversations with Juncker and Löfven, Johnson referred to “the anti-democratic backstop”, Downing Street’s new chosen form of words for a policy negotiated jointly by the UK and EU.Varadkar, speaking on a visit to Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, said he still held out hopes of an agreement. “I don’t accept it’s unavoidable,” he said of no deal.“There are many ways by which a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Either by the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, a further extension or revocation of article 50. So, there are a number of ways that a no deal can be avoided on 31 of October. I am certainly not fatalistic about that.”Varadkar warned, however, that no deal would merely mark the start of a new set of negotiations between the UK and EU, on everything from citizens’ rights to the “orce” settlement and the Irish border.Donohoe was blunter still following a meeting in London with his UK counterpart, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, warning that the relationship between the UK and Ireland would “fundamentally change” in the event of no deal. reported on Monday that Brussels diplomats briefed on a meeting between senior EU figures and Boris Johnson’s chief envoy had been told a no-deal Brexit was the UK’s “central scenario” and that Downing Street would not countenance any discussions involving the backstop.﻿Conservative rebels are plotting to stop Johnson and Gove pursuing a no-deal Brexit by trying to bring down the government in a confidence motion. This would give them 14 days to form a new government of “national unity” composed of those opposed to hard Brexit to prevent a crash-out on 31 October.However, Labour appeared to stymie that proposal on Tuesday. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, told Channel 4 News the party “wouldn’t countenance a national government of unity” to deal with Brexit.“What we don’t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get-out-of-jail-free card,” she said, suggesting Labour would prefer an election.If no government of national unity is formed within 14 days of a lost confidence vote, an election would be called.Cummings has indicated he believes that in such a scenario the prime minister could plough on with a no-deal Brexit and call an election for after the UK has left the EU on 31 October.One of the Tory rebels, Dominic Grieve, told Channel 4 News the Queen would have to step in to “sack” Johnson if he refused to go after losing a confidence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7250570f0800c49fa11de6c38ac4453d585ea46/33_343_4149_2490/master/4149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb434e772675253a00b5b392469d2e7","title":"khadijah mellah glorious goodwood horse racing hijab","story":"The 18-year-old from Brixton has been inundated with support since becoming the first jockey to race in Britain wearing a hijab and moreover to winFive days after Khadijah Mellah had her headline-grabbing moment in the charity race at Glorious Goodwood she has not quite returned to earth. “It’s basically taken over my life,” she said on Tuesday, during one of many interviews, demand for which reflects the worldwide interest in the previously unknown 18-year-old from Brixton who won a race at the famously tricky circuit mere months after climbing aboard a racehorse for the first time.Khadijah became the first jockey to ride in – and win – a race in Britain wearing a hijab. The job of steering Haverland to glory in the Magnolia Cup took not much more than a minute. It is a minute that Khadijah has been reliving endlessly since.“I’ve spent a lot of time talking to people about my race, it’s been a busy few days. I’ve been trying to take it all in, to be fair.”Her mood appears to be happy but on the edge of worn out. Certainly Haverland has never faced such a test of stamina as his rider is now tackling. Great British Racing, the sport’s promotional wing, has struggled to keep track of the media interest but has so far logged more than 1,000 TV broadcasts and online pieces on top of the print coverage that had Khadijah on front pages on Friday.She has made the news in France, Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and South Africa. In this country ITV has given the green light to a documentary about her journey in horse racing, to be called Riding A Dream and due on screens in the autumn.Khadijah radiates a sense of unreality that any of this is happening to her, as well she may. In January, impending A level exams were the biggest thing in her calendar, before the ITV Racing presenter Oli Bell, a patron of the Ebony Riding School in Brixton where she occasionally rode, started to think she might be a suitable candidate for an ambitious project.One of the wholly unexpected consequences was that Khadijah found herself at the annual Regency Ball at Goodwood House on Thursday night, mixing with the rich and famous and being introduced to the singer Ellie Goulding. “It was amazing, so grand.”She takes as much relish in the pleasure last week’s success gave to those around her. “My parents have been really happy, completely over the moon for me. They’ve been posting and sharing every single article there is about me. They didn’t initially think I could do it, so me winning was a massive thing.“My friends and family and even distant relatives and friends I haven’t been in contact with for ages have all been messaging me: ‘I’ve just seen you, congratulations!’ My primary school teacher contacted me, I hadn’t spoken to in, like, 10 years.”Speaking earlier, on the Good Morning Britain sofa, she had said: “I can’t wait to hear a success story where someone says, actually Khadijah Mellah’s been a role model to me.” It might be that such a person shares a roof with her as her younger brother Abdus, now 16, has hopes of making it as a jockey and could apply for an amateur’s licence as early as next year.Khadijah’s story is a gift for a sport anxious to expand its horizons, as is readily acknowledged by Rose Grissell, who joined the British Horseracing Authority last year as head of ersity and inclusion. Noting that Khadijah was the first jockey to wear a hijab while riding in a race in Britain, Grissell says: “When you get the first of anything, it really helps people to imagine the world differently and inspires people to defy expectations about how things can change and what the world should look like.“I think her success will inspire many different types of people, and not just now but also in future years, whether that’s as a woman, a young woman, a woman of colour or a Muslim, or people from a similar background, growing up in an urban area. To achieve what she did in such a short space of time was really incredible.“Obviously there’s a lot of work to do but I think it will definitely have an impact. She’s getting exposure much wider beyond racing, which demonstrates that we are an inclusive sport, we welcome everyone, from whatever background. We’re one of the few sports where you can have not only men and women competing against each other but also people with a variety of different disabilities as well.“We really are an inclusive sport and Khadijah’s success helped us spread that message far and wide. The hope is that people who may not have thought racing is for them, or who may not have had any knowledge of racing, may think differently now.“This is an ongoing focus, something that’s going to take a long time, to position racing as a sport for everybody and to reach out to different communities that we’re currently not reaching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe90788f6977035233d82a30512c27057e5bd2c/75_0_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f958832a53f0a4dc9df0680a41cb05ec","title":"share your bame experiences of the edinburgh fringe festival","story":"We want to hear from BAME people who are attending - or have attended - the festival.

Several apologies, in fact. You’re not supposed to start a performance by saying sorry, she acknowledges, it tends to make audience members uncomfortable. But then again, All of Me is not all that interested in setting spectators at ease.Nothing about depression – the subject of Horton’s show – is comfortable or crowd-pleasing. All of Me used to be one kind of show about depression, Horton explains: a lighter, more hopeful kind of show – a bit like Mess, Horton’s playful piece about her experience of anorexia. But during the making of this show, Horton became ill again. So now All of Me is unashamedly bleak, resisting the redemptive narrative arc that is so often expected from plays about mental health.Confronting the darkness that can make death seem welcoming, Horton takes us on a journey to the underworld. Her depression is interwoven with myth, switching abruptly from ancient narrative to everyday hopelessness. One moment, Horton is approaching s of the underworld the next, she’s lying on the floor in unwashed clothes, unable to get up. Through layers of storytelling, song and looped sound we hear the overwhelming noise of despair – as well as its occasional absurdity.It’s messy. It could hardly be otherwise. And, perhaps more surprisingly, it’s beautiful. The underworld as evoked by Horton is as seductive as it is haunting. The dim lighting bounces off a pair of glitterballs, sending fragments of brightness into the gloom. Horton, a deathly figure in a towering headdress, sings a melancholy tune that lingers in the ear. So much about depression is ugly or simply blank, but Horton is able to find a strange sort of magnificence in the darkness.There’s also a fierce political edge to All of Me. Through its non-linear structure, it pushes back against society’s desire for quick fixes. The show, with its loops and echoes, recognises mental health as something that ebbs and flows – as well as something that responds to the society we live in. If we want to hear fewer stories about mental illness, Horton suggests, we need to “unfuck the world”.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd915a9efb4f8390c05a1ba55f8e79e379396d46/0_301_6265_3758/master/6265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56c114ef0f76f97feb2adb2f6233f6c7","title":"ivankaplay review underbelly cowgate edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Underbelly Cowgate, EdinburghDespite a solid solo performance from McLean Peterson, there’s little funny about the president’s refusal to act on gun controlIs Trump not yet beyond satire? This limp comedy about the president’s refusal to act on gun control is told from the perspective of his daughter. Despite a perfectly solid solo performance, there’s little funny here. The putrid new wave of shootings only serves to highlight the play’s inability to carve any real wit around the issue.It is not McLean Peterson’s fault. Under Rachel Dart’s precise direction, she is sharp as Ivanka, fluent at the flicks between icy glares – seeming like she might strip the skin off your face if she thought it would improve her complexion – and succulent smiles. Immaculately dressed in a cape dress, she waits for “daddy” to come out of a meeting in the Oval Office. Playing with a strand of hair, her words are doused in the arrogance imbued by being Trump’s favourite. She is largely constrained but her patience wains, and she occasionally unzips her skinsuit to let out some anger or lust. “I even like that he’d fuck me if he could,” she says about her father in a huff. Pause. Dismissive hand wave. “He couldn’t.” Charles Gershman’s script dips tentatively into the struggle between Ivanka’s role as daughter and adviser, and when she sees a news bulletin about children separated at the border, she attempts mediation. “Maybe we should care about this one,” she says sweetly. He says no – he needs the vote – and placates her with money and attention.The talk of gun control is vague and generic, with all the humour relying desperately on knowing chuckles. The moment that most acutely gets to Trump’s lack of care is in Ivanka’s description of him not letting her win at tennis. However snobbish and vacuous she is, the play wants us to be on her side. But to what end? Are we meant to feel sorry for her? Find her inaction excusable while she’s on her father’s payroll? Laugh it all off?

After Cloudflare cut ties, other service providers followed suit on Monday on Tuesday, a version of the site was available, but with severely limited functionality.Watkins also alleged without providing any evidence that a different internet platform was involved in the El Paso massacre.“First of all, the El Paso shooter posted on Instagram, not 8chan,” he said. “Later someone uploaded a manifesto. However, that manifesto was not uploaded by the Walmart shooter. I don’t know if he wrote it or not, but it was not uploaded by the murderer.”A spokeswoman for Instagram said the company has “found nothing to support this theory”. The suspect’s Instagram had not been used in more than a year when it was deactivated on Saturday, she said, and Instagram has been cooperating with law enforcement. The Cloudflare chief executive, Matthew Prince, also confirmed on Sunday that the company had seen evidence that the manifesto was uploaded to 8chan prior to the attack.The claim has nevertheless been repeated as fact by various rightwing pundits on Twitter.Attempts to derail a conversation or muddy the waters with specious allegations are the lingua franca of Watkins’ site, where racist and homophobic slurs are common and anonymous users delight in the shocking and obscene.As major internet platforms try to halt the dissemination of toxic content, Watkins’ site has become an essential tool for those trying to spread it.When Ted Kaczynski, the terrorist and triple murderer known as the “Unabomber”, wanted the world to read his thoughts, he demanded that the New York Times and Washington Post publish his 35,000 word “manifesto” or he would send a bomb “with intent to kill”. The newspapers weighed the decision for three months, despite the threat. When they finally decided to publish at the recommendation of the US attorney general and Federal Bureau of Investigation, the terrorist screed was packaged with context and analysis.Twenty-four years later, white nationalist terrorists can skip the blackmail and go directly to 8chan to attain notoriety, spread their ideas and inspire copycats. In the first 24 hours after the live-streamed massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, Facebook removed 1.5m copies of the video.8chan was founded in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an even less restrictive alternative to another notorious message board, 4chan. The site’s popularity exploded in 2014 when 4chan banned discussion of the misogynistic harassment campaign known as Gamergate, prompting a migration of 4chan’s most committed harassers to the newer forum.Brennan and Watkins started working together in 2014, according to a profile by Fusion. Watkins had learned computer skills in the US army, and while serving in the military made money with a side business – a pornography site and web hosting services catering to adult Japanese sites.He left the army in 1998 and his company, NT Technology, began hosting the popular Japanese message board that inspired 4chan, 2channel, two years later. Watkins eventually took control of that site in 2014. That same year, he offered his assistance to Brennan, who been struggling to keep 8chan functioning. Brennan moved to the Philippines to work with Watkins, who eventually took ownership of 8chan, too.Brennan stopped working for 8chan in 2016 and cut ties in 2018.Brennan has called for the site to be shut down in a number of interviews since the El Paso shooting, arguing that Watkins has failed to manage the site responsibly and even encouraged extremism with decisions such as running the tagline “Embrace infamy” on the site’s homepage. In the past, Brennan had cheered the site’s involvement in harassment campaigns.  has contacted Brennan and Watkins for comment.On Monday, Brennan tweeted: “The only ones who will suffer from 8chan going down are mass shooters who planned to use it as a platform and Jim Watkins.”Watkins’ problems now go beyond his service providers. On Tuesday, the chairman and ranking member of the House committee on homeland security wrote to Watkins demanding that he “provide testimony regarding 8chan’s efforts to investigate and mitigate the proliferation of extremist content, including white supremacist extremist content, on your website”.“Americans deserve to know what, if anything, you, as the owner and operator, are doing to address the proliferation of extremist content on 8chan,” representatives Bennie Thompson and Mike Rogers wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16dad25eb007cb21e8736ff0e2a4b875eeb3b3bf/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d4683ecbb8fbacb4326141df4bd5558","title":"how much does google know about you podcast","story":"Alex Hern on how Google’s use of personal data has potentially helped create a new age of mass surveillance.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

Member states would then have two years to translate the revised directive into national law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef405b622add1c4f653c25c9c93ef1af9d865522/573_735_3239_1944/master/3239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ebb7a3b691c91c7c875c532190a26a2","title":"i am really shy introducing phoenix the worlds first hijab wearing champion wrestler","story":"Malaysia’s Nor Diana, 19, says she becomes transformed in the ring, ready to take on her opponent – and conservative Islamic critics Nor Diana can remember vividly the first time she stepped out to make her wrestling debut. Outside the ropes she had always been a quiet and studious hijab-wearing Malaysian woman, but here in the ring, dressed in black leather embossed with flames and as the crowd roared, she suddenly felt like a fire burst from inside her: here she was Phoenix.Nor, who last month won Malaysia’s biggest wrestling tournament – defeating four men for the title – cuts an unlikely figure for a pro wrestler. A 19-year-old who is just 152cm (5ft) tall and weighs 43kg (94lbs), she speaks softly as she sits in her training centre in the town of Puchong, close to Kuala Lumpur, dressed in her hijab, wide glasses and floral baju kurung, traditional Malaysian dress.“In the real world I am really shy, I am very reserved, but something happens to me when I go into the ring as Phoenix, I become a totally different person,” she says. “Phoenix is more fun and more energetic and brave, she has this fire in her and she always wants to win. And that’s why I love wrestling because I get to do things I could never do in real life.”Indeed, over the past four years Phoenix has steadily grown to be one of the biggest names in Malaysian pro-wrestling, defying stigmas and the expectations often placed on Muslim women in Malaysian society and bringing in a whole new female crowd to the male-dominated sport. “The response has been amazing,” says Nor. “Last year, we had all-female wrestling tryouts and no one turned up. But this week we had tryouts and three hijabi girls came to the training.”Nor’s love of wrestling began when she was 14, playing WWE wrestling games with her brother on his PlayStation Portable, and then watching matches on TV with her father and four brothers. As she watched WWE icons such as The Rock, The Undertaker and John Cena be thrown around the ropes, something stirred in her. “I just loved the characters of the wrestlers and stories they told for each match,” she recalls. “And even though it seemed impossible, I kept thinking: what if, one day, I could be one of them.”But after watching female wrestler Sasha Banks fight, finding her way into the ring became an obsession. She would frantically Google professional wrestling in Malaysia and scour Facebook, until she came upon MyPW, Malaysia’s first and only pro-wrestling outfit which in 2015 was about to put on its first show. Nor went to two live matches before finding the courage to attend tryouts, her younger brother and father coming along for support.Her coach, Ayez Shaukat Fonseka Farid, recalls his first encounter with Nor, when she sent him a message on Instagram asking how to join pro wrestling. “When I saw she was this small hijabi girl, I was a bit surprised but for me, I’ve always believed that if a person is passionate about something, who are we to stop them,” says Ayez.“Since that first day, she has never missed training. The only issue was that she was very, very timid, it was very hard to break her out of her shell, and in order to be a good pro wrestler you need to be very confident and very charismatic. But I saw potential in her from her first match because as soon as she came on, she just transformed into this whole different person.”“What fans really love about her is the heart,” he added. “She gets slammed around a lot but she always gets back up.”Professional wrestling in Malaysia is still in its infancy, and while there are now 30 pro wrestlers who take part in matches five times a year, it is still a hobby for most. Before her first match, Nor, who works full time in a hospital, and her father had to scour a secondhand shop to pull together her Phoenix costume.For the first three years, Nor chose to wear a luchador wrestling mask when she fought in public as Phoenix. “I was always afraid of what people in Malaysia, but especially the fans, would think when they saw a hijabi girl wrestling and so wearing a mask made it a bit easier,” she says. However, in December 2018, a storyline was decided for her next match: if she lost, she would have to unmask and reveal her identity.When she was defeated by her opponent, Luna, she felt this deep fear in the pit of her stomach “Before I took off the mask I was really afraid,” says Nor. “But as soon as I took it off and people could see that I was wearing a hijab, people started cheering and shouting all these supportive things and I cried in the ring. And my friends told me later that backstage, when I unmasked, some of the wrestlers, the guys I train with, cried too. For them it showed how much pride I had as a wrestler.”The support she has had from the wrestling community has made it easier to cope with the backlash aimed at her online, mainly on Facebook, from more conservative quarters, with comments on morality or calling her a slut and a whore. Nor sighs deeply as she discusses the “horrible, really bad personal comments” she has to endure. “There has been quite a big backlash, people telling me that hijab girls should not be doing extreme sports and I should not train with guys because it was shameful,” says Nor. “It is hard for me because I am with my phone 247 and you can’t help but scroll through all the comments.”“But actually they fuel my fire,” she adds. “If I had listened to those voices when I started I wouldn’t be where I am now. So I use their words as motivation to train more, to prove to these people that being a hijab girl should not stop me, that I have something here I know I can do well – no matter what they say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a980533f218167d4eb2297b1484cd30889a13fa/0_471_5394_3236/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff381c8b3542c8b91e564892e12624ae","title":"italy matteo salvini embarks on beach tour amid election speculation","story":"Far-right leader takes unusual step in effort to drum up support in south of countryMatteo Salvini is taking his perennial campaign to Italy’s beaches as the far-right leader seeks to whip up more support before widely-anticipated new elections.The Italian parliament officially begins its summer break at the end of the week, but Salvini, deputy prime minister and interior minister, is finishing on Wednesday to begin what the Italian media are calling his “beach tour”.“Beach tour? They’re public meetings that the citizens of the territories have asked for,” he insisted during an interview with Radio 24. “Alas, I’m not going to be playing beach volleyball.”Sabaudia, a beach town close to Rome, is the first stop on a two-week trip that will also take in the central regions of Abruzzo and Molise, before heading south to Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily and Campania.The northern Liguria region is also on the agenda, where on 14 August the minister will attend a service to mark the first anniversary of Genoa’s Morandi bridge collapse, which killed 43 people.“He’s doing a rally on the beach? I thought he was coming to have a dip in the sea,” said Gianluca Marrese, the leftwing deputy mayor of Policoro in Basilicata.“You rarely see this kind of thing happening on the beach, but as an administration and a town, of course we’ll be welcoming. Besides, it will only last an hour or so.”Salvini got into the beach mood last week at his favourite haunt, Papeete resort in Milano Marittima, where the bare-chested minister posed for selfies, drank cocktails, ogled dancers and did a spot of DJing. Salvini also made time for a press conference, during which he insulted a journalist who had filmed the minister’s son riding on the back of a police jet-ski, insinuating that he must be a paedophile.Salvini will be feeling gung-ho as he sets off for the trip after his security bill, which could lead to captains of migrant rescue ships being fined up to €1m (£920,000) if they defy his port blockade, won a vote in parliament on Monday.The UN refugee agency on Tuesday said the law could endanger the lives of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean.Salvini has two rallies planned in Sabaudia – one at 10am, the other at 9pm. He will also be in Anzio, another Lazio beach town, at 5pm.It is unclear whether in between rallying he will return to Rome for a parliamentary vote on unblocking work on a contentious high-speed rail project linking Italy and France.The League wants the long-stalled TAV to go ahead, while M5S has built most of its popularity on vehemently opposing it. Salvini again threatened a return to the polls during his interview with Radio 24 if M5S continued to resist his key policies.Salvini’s tour has been criticised by members of the opposition.“Salvini is choosing the beaches and not places of work or hardship because during the summer nobody wants to see images of suffering, which unfortunately has been on the rise since this government began,” said Salvatore Margiotta, an MP with the centre-left Democratic party.“In short, he relies on his brilliant propaganda machine … projecting himself as the ordinary man, enemy of the elite, all the while using a stage filled with colour and music … unfortunately, Italians will end up paying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5d8bc0347407f522237c29ad8e32d4ef31f9bc0/52_389_3386_2031/master/3386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a41d14f9c6b7bb546f13de30e250d97d","title":"hiroshima bombing 74th anniversary in pictures","story":"Survivors mark 74th anniversary of atomic bombing of city in second world war with one minute’s silence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979004.1565130692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervical smear tests contract given without proper assessment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident of DCU Prof Brian MacCraith (right), alongside HSE director Paul Reid, found that the almost total reliance on a single international supplier of laboratory services for the CervicalCheck national cancer screening programme was a source of ‘significant fragility’ for the programme. Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe contract awarded to US-based Quest Diagnostics laboratory to deal with the backlog of cervical smear tests was given without proper due diligence or risk assessment, a review has revealed.President of DCU Prof Brian MacCraith found that the almost total reliance on a single international supplier of laboratory services for the CervicalCheck national cancer screening programme was a source of “significant fragility” for the programme and there was a gross underestimation of the scale of the problem.And he warned that too few people within CervicalCheck were managing too many projects.His rapid review, commissioned on July 15th and published on Tuesday, was established after it emerged that the HSE was aware that more than 800 women and their GPs had not been informed of their smear test results because of IT failings and human error. And in 3,215 cases results went to GPs but not to the women concerned.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said a process was under way to inform all women affected and this was expected to be completed in the next few weeks. He stressed that these were designated “low risk cases”.“I really regret and apologise it happened to the women. I wish it was different,” he said as he pledged to develop a culture of “putting women first”.Intentions and deliveryThe organisation 221+ which represents women affected by the original CervicalCheck controversy said it was a relief that the clinical risk was deemed low for the women affected by this specific failure. But it said: “It is clear that there was an inability to ‘join the dots’ as far back as January of this year and that there is still a gap between best intentions and effective delivery.”The report found a decision was made not to communicate with women about the IT problems for six months and Prof MacCraith highlighted the frustration of women “not only by delays in receiving their results but more so by the lack of any clarifying or contextual information”.At the launch of the report for the HSE, he asked what it said about the system that women had to seek their own information through parliamentary questions.Expressing concern that there was no proper due diligence done before Quest Diagnostics undertook the additional tests, Prof MacCraith said the laboratory was approved for testing but the problem was with the lack of checking and validating that the Quest IT system could be seamlessly integrated into Irish operating processes.A new tracking system is to be established to allow women follow the progress of their smear tests to their conclusion. The HSE has appointed management consultant Celine Fitzgerald as interim chief executive of CervicalCheck."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978969.1565127119!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a what is the latest cervicalcheck controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris. Photograph: Alan Betson What is the latest problem with CervicalCheck?Essentially, the IT system at the US-based Quest Diagnostics laboratory in Chantilly, Virginia – which is contracted by the Department of Health to process smear tests – was not compatible with the CervicalCheck IT system and so test results were not being passed on to the Irish system.“Manual workarounds” were used, ie people inputting results. This went on for eight months but should only have been for a short time leading to “human error”.How did the problem start?In November 2018, the National Screening Service, which is over CervicalCheck, agreed to Quest Diagnostics processing additional tests after a 30 per cent increase in the number of tests from 280,000 to 330,000, resulting in a significant backlog. This was a combination of routine smear tests and the offer of free repeat smear tests for women concerned about their results after the original CervicalCheck controversy. This related to delays in information going to more than 220 women diagnosed with cancer.When did knowledge of the IT problem arise?In February 2019, Quest Diagnostics indicated it had a problem transferring results and that a manual process may be required. It was agreed that a manual system be put in place. Quest said it was seeking an e-solution but a manual system would have to continue until it was found.Who made the decision not to contact the women about the problem?In April, CervicalCheck sent a briefing note to all GPs about a range of issues but the women who were awaiting test results were not informed that there was a problem.Who is ‘Sharon’ and what is her role?Sharon, identified only by her first name, is a woman who made repeated calls and sent numerous emails about delays in receiving her smear test results. She first emailed the Department of Health on April 3rd and her persistence was key to the emergence of the large-scale problem.Was anyone else expressing concern about delays?GPs were contacting CervicalCheck about delays in results from the Chantilly facility. The service in turn contacted Quest in June.When was the extent of the problem properly identified?Quest Diagnostics confirmed to the National Screening Service on July 16th that “in or about April 2019” a data file with the results of about 800 “rescue samples” was not sent to Quest’s facility in Dublin which prints and issues the results to GPs. This, it said, was due to “human error”.When were Sharon’s concerns linked to a larger problem?On June 25th, the National Screening Service wrote to the Department of Health about Sharon’s test and this is the first link with the IT problem.When did the screening service find out that Quest Diagnostics had not sent results to GPs?The service found out in the second week of July that the results had not been sent, and on July 10th it told the Department of Health that approximately 800 women were not issued with test result letters.When was the Minister for Health informed?Simon Harris was briefed about the issue on July 10th. On July 15th, Paul Reid, the chief executive of the HSE, announced a rapid review of the controversy which would be chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University. Some 30 interviews were then conducted and more than 4,000 documents reviewed.Wasn’t there another problem with the labs?In November 2018, Quest alerted CervicalCheck to a separate problem about the expiration of samples for HPV testing at its laboratory in Teterboro, New Jersey. A total of 11,763 samples were affected by the expiry date but in 6,446 cases no re-test was found to be required. Quest Laboratories in Chantilly was able to “rescue” some samples. After a re-test, 55 of the “rescue samples” proved positive for HPV, the virus which can cause cancer, when the initial test was negative. The GPs of the women concerned were informed in February 2019.A tracking system is to be established to allow women follow the progress of their tests. On behalf of the HSE, Reid apologised to women, pledged to develop a culture of “putting women first”, and said he accepted all recommendations in the rapid review including ensuring CervicalCheck becomes a well structured organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Possible \u0026lsquocriminal element\u0026rsquo not ruled out in disappearances of missing Irish-French teenagerFootball and GAA clubs remember young man who was dedicated to his team matesFamily of John Boreland, shot dead in north Belfast in 2016, say \u0026lsquobroken lives will never be helaed\u0026rsquoScientists believe bird would have weighed about 7kg and stood nearly 1m tallLetter from Flanagan to members informed them he would be open to reappointing themWoman was left without equipment for her baby for at least three days, volunteers foundSocial Farming Ireland opens up farm life to adults with physical or intellectual disabilityPaschal Donohoe confirms Taoiseach\u0026rsquos and PM\u0026rsquos offices in contact during BBC interviewJohn Boreland shot as he got out of his car in Belfast in 2016Report shows number of workers aged 50 and over has increased 330,000 in 10 yearsMikey Leddy from Co Meath fatally injured in incident on seafront of Puerto del CarmenToo few people in CervicalCheck managing too many projects, rapid review findsTechnical problem uncovered by woman who questioned delay in getting her resultsProtesters call on Minister to intervene as 18 beef processing plants picketedTaoiseach refuses to play Brexit \u0026lsquoblame game\u0026rsquo during F\u0026eacuteile an Phobail debate in BelfastFormer Fianna F\u0026aacuteil minister and Dublin North West TD \u0026lsquorelieved\u0026rsquo at developmentPaul Reid says health body will \u0026lsquodeliver on all commitments in service plan\u0026rsquoResults of more than 4,000 smear test not affected by \u0026lsquomajor communications failure\u0026rsquoProposal likely to run foul of environmental worries, says Independent Cllr Mannix Flynn"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978908.1565116766!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"asylum seekers living in cramped poorly serviced sites says group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFacilities for asylum seekers at the East End Hotel in Portarlington pictured by a Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland volunteer. Photograph: MSAIA grassroots group of asylum seekers has complained about a lack of support for residents in emergency overflow direct provision facilities, citing one instance a mother left without nappies or baby formula for a 20 day old infant.The Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) visited several hotels and guest houses which are being used to house asylum seekers due to capacity issues at direct provision centres across the state.MASI said its volunteers had visited a woman who had been placed in emergency accommodation in the Maldron Hotel in Limerick, and who had been left without bottle sterilising equipment, nappies, baby formula or a cot. The organisation said the woman had been without the equipment for three days when it met her.In a statement, Dalata Hotels, which owns the Maldron Hotel chain, said it could not comment on inidual circumstances, but in general it said guests were booked by the Department of Justice into a small number of its hotels, and were provided accommodation on a full board basis consistent with its other customers.“Services or needs beyond that are the responsibility of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) and the Department. Though circumstances rarely necessitate, the hotel acts as a liaison between guests and the RIADepartment, however, the primary responsibility remains with the RIADOJE.”It is understood the issue was addressed soon after the Department of Justice became aware of it.MASI also claimed that cramped facilities were also observed at the East End Hotel in Portarlington, and that “substandard or inadequate food” was given to asylum seekers at the White House in Roscrea. The organisation said that the accommodation provided to the Roscrea group was also cramped.Efforts to contact the owners of the White House were unsuccessful. Pat Martin, one of the owners of the East End Hotel, referred queries to the Department of Justice.MASI also said asylum seekers in Esplanade Hotel in Bray, Co Wicklow had been told they were not allowed visitors on the premises. The hotel also referred queries to the Department of Justice.In a statement, the department said the 30 providers of emergency accommodation were contractually obliged to provide bed spaces and breakfast, lunch and dinner. Prior to agreement, the premises are visited by a staff member from the RIA.It said that while emergency locations were often opened at short notice, the RIA then liaised with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding the local roll-out of required services to residents. It said RIA was available to deal with issues residents are experiencing and would welcome queries MASI may have received directly.There are 6,033 people in the 38 dedicated direct provision centres in the state. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice issued a nation-wide call for bed and board in hotels so it could continue to offer accommodation to newly-arrived applicants. In addition to people living in the direct provision system, there are more than 775 people with a protection status living in the system who have permission to remain and have access to housing supports. However, due to the wider housing crisis, these people often remain in direct provision despite being eligible for housing which is ultimately unavailable elsewhere."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978650.1565109359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"droughts force thousands to abandon way of life in somaliland","story":"Locals in Carracad, Somaliland, have been hit by drought and cyclones, threatening their agricultural way of life. Video: Concern \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKhadan Mohammed Hamed (19): She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class and realises that combination has eroded a way of life.  Photograph: Gavin DouglasConcern WorldwideThey are the vanguard of a cohort likely to soon number many millions of people in climate-vulnerable locations across the planet.They are crammed into supposedly temporary camps to cater for the tens of thousands of villagers forced off the land because of sustained droughts.Conditions in settlements on the outskirts of Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and near the city of Borama are primitive – so many people living in close proximity without running water or toilets and with little electricity.Home is in the form of a flimsy makeshift tent, a corrugated iron shack or a tiny house of one room, two at best. Solid waste and vast amounts of plastic are intermittently heaped on the side of narrow streets. There is next-to-no public lighting. What there is comes courtesy of small solar panels, giving a hint of what could be in terms of comfort and safety if the cheap renewable energy source was more fully deployed.Water supplyWater is trucked in, the same way 70 per cent of Hargeisa is supplied, though there are plans to build a water supply system with international support. For now, water has to be boiled, invariably by way of a wood fire, before consumption.Listening to their stories of forced migration, many are clearly traumatised at having to abandon a rural way of life, which up to a few years ago was feasible in spite of intermittent drought. Many pine to return to the land but they know it is not feasible.They are officially described as “internally displaced people” (IDPs), forced to flee their home but who remain within the country’s borders. In reality, most are climate refugees.In Somaliland, a self-declared state in east Africa twice the size of Ireland, they are estimated to total 600,000 people, though that number can rise sharply in response to drought, flooding or a cyclone, events occurring more frequently due to climate disruption.Through interpreters, the common thread emerges: loss of livestock due to more frequent droughts and not enough water to sustain their pastoral existence. In contrast, increased floods are often a contributory factor, as they wash away crops, turn fields into gulleys and undermine attempts to ersify. It ends with the inevitable move to the city and for some a camp, where they have lived for almost 10 years.With dignity, women outline their personal circumstances in an unvarnished way. In more ways than one they are household heads and look after money efficiently. Sometimes it’s a consequence of husbands and sons still working in rural areas.Listening to their stories and observing their surroundings is enough to graphically illustrate arduous circumstances. It is a harrowing experience because their distress is palpable and yet solutions seem obvious and inexpensive to an outsider.The three camps near Hargeisa – Dgalli (9,000 people in 1,500 households), Mooga A (3,000 people, 500 households) and Mooga B (1,300 people, 225 households) – are barely a few kilometres apart.Sahra Badal, who has been five years and seven months in Dgalli, still describes herself as a pastoralist. A orcee with five children, she had 35 goats and a donkey to sustain the family. Now it’s just three goats that wander around stony land with little vegetation where the camp is located – most goats in the vicinity have a tag around their neck with the mobile phone number of their owner.Selling fruit“Life is very difficult but cash helps,” she says, referring gratefully to monthly support of $60, which enables her to send her children to school and helped her set up a small business selling fruit and vegetables.Her neighbour Nura Ismail Saed, who is two years in the camp, would prefer to move back to the rural area from which she came with her five children but she suggests this is unlikely. Asked if that made her sad, she replies: “A lot, a lot.”In Mooga B, which has the least facilities – no shops, no school, no available land nearby, the women repeatedly highlight the absence of toilets one describes how a pregnant woman had to be brought to a mobile health clinic in a wheelbarrow.Indications of emerging resilience are the only heartening aspect in the face of such poverty. Milgo Ahmed Hashi sells milk from her home, which she buys in from Hargeisa. With no refrigeration, she uses plastic bags in an attempt to keep it cool and plans to have it all sold by 5pm daily so it doesn’t sour. The profits enable her to feed and clothe her 10 children. She hopes there will soon be enough to send her children to school.Khadan Mohammed Hamed (19) completed her secondary education, and though she failed her exams as she was affected by her mother’s death at the time, she hopes to resit them. “I hope to continue, to become a doctor,” she adds. She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class. She realises that combination has eroded a way of life for “people, who were successful farmers, and not farmers any more”.That resilience is obvious the next day when visiting a more established settlement, Ayah 4. A large sign indicates 350 concrete housing units were constructed by UN-Habitat with support “from the people of Japan”. There is an air of permanency though some still live in traditional tents. Many are reconnecting with land nearby (provided by the government) and have more significant livestock numbers. Local commerce is evident with tiny shops, a local market and a small cafe selling tea.Self-help groupsIt is clear that self-help groups, including some aimed at teenagers, set up with support from Concern Worldwide and other aid organisations, are helping to form a backbone for the community.Emerging entrepreneurship is real. Some have savings, which suggests better prospects and quality of life may be realisable. But it means also hard questions have to be faced up to among large sections of what were once nomadic people, according to the director of the Somali Cash Consortium, Alessandro Bini. Is urbanisation, including a shift to small business and services industry, the best option for most of these people? Does it mean pastoralism must change to agriculture which is inevitably more intensive, entailing, for example, pesticides?Implemented correctly, he believes more sustainable communities are possible – backed by “a long-term, predictable safety net” covering the basic needs of a good proportion of the population on a constant basis.Drought year after year makes rural communities weak and vulnerable, according to Abdi-Rashid Haji, Concern Worldwide’s Somalia country director, who recalls how a woman illustrated her plight to him by placing a stick in a piece of muddy, unstable ground, adding: “This was my farm.”“That is when you lose confidence and you end up in an IDP camp,” he says.In building resilience development organisations are acutely conscious that repeated drought prompts negative coping strategies, such as child marriage and labour, school dropouts and family separation.Displacement also gives rise to concerns about safety and security, and underlines the need for child protection. Sexual and gender-based violence in camps is an additional risk. In that scenario, female-headed households, children, older people, those with disabilities and marginalised communities are especially vulnerable to abuse, as well as disease and malnutrition.Reports indicate some urban IDPs in Hargeisa and Burao cities are experiencing “extreme food security outcomes” and the official classification “catastrophe” is figuring more frequently. A visit to a Save the Children health clinic on the outskirts of Borama confirms how close communities, even those in IDP camps, are to famine.Lack of sanitationOut of 1,633 children under five assessed between September and December last year, 319 were “moderately malnourished” and 150 “severely malnourished”.Similar levels have been recorded this year, before the worst effects of the latest drought are predicted to kick in. Poor hygiene arising from a lack of sanitation gives rise to widespread diarrhoea, especially among the young, which further exacerbates their vulnerability.The increasing lure of the city is summed up by Roda Osman living in the rural village of Jir Jir. She has 13 children, three of whom are staying with relatives in the city of Borama and attend secondary school there. She hopes they will get a scholarship to go to university or get a job. “Without education, life is without light,” she adds.Droughts and Cyclone Sagar reduced their livestock to 10 goats and two camels. Crops in recent years have only yielded fodder. She is surviving because of cash payments via mobile from Concern. Fearing further livestock losses, she is quietly banking on her children already in the city, and a hope that with a job they will be able to build a house “and take us to the city”.* Kevin O’Sullivan travelled to Somaliland with the support of Concern Worldwide"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978818.1565110894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"self help groups transforming communities ravaged by drought","story":"An initiative known as Durable Solutions, funded by the EU, is helping families displaced in Somaliland to run small businesses through startup grants.

Since starting the Concern programme, they’ve grown  in wealth, confidence and wellbeing. Photograph: Gavin DouglasConcern Worldwide Almost 20 women are sitting on rugs under the canopy of a large tree with a steel box in their midst with three separate locks.They live in a rural area south of Borama and formed a self-help group called Janagal, which means “paradise” in Somali. It was set up after the 2017 drought with training and seed capital of $376 provided by Concern Worldwide. They sell women’s clothes and shoes which they buy in from the town of Togwajale. “Business is good. We make a good profit,” explains their nominated spokeswoman. In fact, it’s so good they plan to ersify into livestock products and to sell them to farmers in their area, which is made up of 350 households scattered over a wide area.Each member has to deposit the equivalent of $82 monthly into their minibank. Profits are used to reinvest in the business, to help families in difficulty and people who are ill and need healthcare.The women ask if we would like to look at their current assets. The box is opened by three separate keyholders and a large wad of Somali shillings is put on display. “We have $988,” the spokeswoman declares proudly as a smaller amount of dollar bills are laid out.Run a businessOne of the women suggests they might train us on how to run a business they all laugh. On a more serious note, their success has spawned other small businesses formed by neighbours acting on their own initiative without input from outside agencies but using the same approach.Janagal’s success is clear: “The money made a difference. We did not migrate,” the spokeswoman said.Generally, there are 20 women per group who over a year go through two training modules. “The objective is to build strong groups who establish an internal saving and loan scheme which the women decide and manage themselves,” explains Rory Crew of Concern, who is also finance and systems director with Somali Cash Consortium, which helps provide direct support via mobile phones.When the groups are “mature”, Concern opens a formal bank account for the group and provides a start-up grant so the group can establish one or several joint businesses. Group members come from the same community, have a similar social status and share the same problems. Trust and good relationships between group members are very important. “We provide a set of inputs . . . cash books where savings and loans are recorded, a cash box, calculators, etc. We visit the group regularly and check their books are kept up to date and savings and loans, or repayments, are recorded properly to help the groups avoid conflict.”The second training module and a vision-building exercise focus on business skills, such as simple cost calculation and developing a business plan.Buying goats“Mostly, the women engage in simple activities, such as animal fattening (buying goats at low prices during lean season and fattening them up to sell them at high prices before national holidays), petty trade, some vegetable production.” Participants are very positive about the financial gain from the programme but also the social dimension – the opportunity to meet other women with similar needs. It has boosted their self-confidence and standing in the community.Once well established, other programmes can be introduced on human rights advocacy, education, child protection and female genital mutilation, Crew adds.In parallel there is an integrated programme incorporating agriculture, food, income, markets and education. Focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods, it targets school-aged young people, vulnerable women, farmers and pastoralists. Separate efforts are made to build resilience at community level.Some 89 per cent of members reported their resilience to shocks and stresses had increased. They can access emergency assistance and collective support more easily. They benefit from social networks and improved livelihoods.Urban self-help groups do better with business development and success, but this may simply be due to the easier link with markets and potential customers. That is confirmed by the range of businesses in Ayah 4 settlement outside Hargeisa.Long-term solutionsYurub Hussein Mohmoud has lived there for four years following the loss of all her livestock from drought. She prefers life there where she has her own shop selling food, toiletries, cigarettes and camel’s milk. She is a participant in an EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa project aimed at creating long-term solutions for displaced populations.Ista Hil Yusef heads up a Concern-supported group known as Alikhwua (“sisters”), with each member having their own business. She sells charcoal, vegetables, eggs, milk and snack food and travels to a market at 4am each day to source fresh produce.Asked about the secret of success, she cites a rule whereby members are fined for late payments into their fund, and a Friday gathering to discuss what they will do with the money."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Brexit latest news: Dominic Cummings challenges Remainer MPs as he warns they do not get to choose which votes they respectFive key conundrums facing the Johnson government - and what they tell you about risk of no-deal BrexitBlood spots found in hotel room of British astrophysicist missing on Greek island The rise of anti-Semitism in Europe: \u0026#39Go back to your own country they say.

suggesting recent YouTube growth is as much among over-34s as among younger people”.  The report comes after the BBC and ITV announced that streaming subscription service BritBox will launch later this year at £5.99 a month.Game of Thrones suggested appointment-to-view television is still alive and kickingWhen it came to complaints, under 34s care least about bad language, but are twice as likely as those aged 55 and over to “have found a perceived form of discrimination to be offensive”. Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom, said: The way we watch TV is changing faster than ever before. In the space of seven years, streaming services have grown from nothing to reach nearly half of British homes.But traditional broadcasters still have a vital role to play, producing the kind of brilliant UK programmes that overseas tech giants struggle to match.The Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was the most-viewed broadcast across all channels with an average of 12 million people watching it at any one time and nearly 25m watching at least 15 minutes.Line of DutyBut, the report noted, “overall numbers were lower than those watching the 2011 royal wedding” of Prince William and Kate Middleton, which saw 34.2 million - or 60 per cent all iniduals - tune in. Seven of the men’s football World Cup games made it to the top ten programmes of 2018, while the BBC’s Bodyguard was the most watched drama in 2018 with 14.3 million viewers tuning in for the finale. British-made dramas Line of Duty, Bodyguard and Killing Eve were particularly successful for the BBC, while Love Island accounted for half of all viewers on ITV2. Friends, the US sitcom now on Netflix, remained the most popular show on streaming services, followed by The Grand Tour on Amazon.  Brexit latest news: Dominic Cummings challenges Remainer MPs as he warns they do not get to choose which votes they respectFive key conundrums facing the Johnson government - and what they tell you about risk of no-deal BrexitBlood spots found in hotel room of British astrophysicist missing on Greek island The rise of anti-Semitism in Europe: \u0026#39Go back to your own country they say.

They said on Monday they would block administrators from entering the site.“There has been a series of board meetings, the result of which is that administrators will be appointed over the course of the day,” a Harland and Wolff spokesman said.The business was put up for sale last year by Norwegian parent Dolphin Drilling, which filed for bankruptcy in June. The Norwegian administrator of Dolphin Drilling did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Opened in 1861, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people in its Second World War heyday and remains a potent symbol of Belfast’s past as an industrial engine of the British Empire.Created with Sketch.Curse of the Titanic: What happened to those who survived?

That followed similarly muted growth in May and June.\u0026nbspJuly’s increase was propped up by spending on entertainment such as cinema tickets for Toy Story 4 and The Lion King.“Spending has remained relatively subdued over the past few months, with an underlying uncertainty about the wider economic and political landscape causing many to hold off making purchases of bigger ticket items,” said Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard.Consumer spending, which makes up over 60 percent of Britain’s GDP, has so far been relatively immune to the Brexit turmoil that has hurt businesses’ revenues and investment. But there are emerging signs consumers are also starting to slow down as the Brexit deadline nears.\u0026nbspFor example, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday that sales of new cars to iniduals fell 2 per cent in July compared with a year ago.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love.

As I say in the article and have said many times before, I am extremely grateful to Taylor for inviting me to open for her, Charli said. She\u0027s one of the biggest artists of my generation and the Reputation tour was one of the biggest tours in history.In the printed version of this much wider conversation by answers about this tour were boiled down into one kind of weird sentence – leading up to that tour I\u0027d been playing a tonne of 18+ club shows and so to be on stage in front of all ages was new to me and made me approach my performances with a whole new kind of energy – more so I talked about how it was brilliant opening for Taylor, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity I was given and how much fun it was to perform to a new audience!She concluded: Any tour I\u0027ve been on with any other artist as an opening act has always taught me so much. It\u0027s always wonderful to watch other artists do their thing, own their stage and speak their language to their dedicated fan bases – and this was especially true for the\u0026nbspReputation tour. Hope this gives clarity to what was a great interview! Lots of love.Charli XCX releases her new album\u0026nbspCharli\u0026nbspon 13 September.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.She also spoke about how she has responded to accusations of cultural in the past.“I would hit back and say, ‘What about this that I had to go through?’ because I wanted to talk so much about my experiences of things I didn’t have, and I think it felt like I wasn’t acknowledging that there is white privilege and there is institutionalised racism,” she said.\u0026nbsp“It seemed to a lot of people like I was living in this bubble or unaware of all these things that people have to experience.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste.Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin’s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940’s The Great Dictator and Chaplin’s most polarising film hadn’t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin’s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin’s satirical social commentary and his character’s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp’s journey from the world’s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you’re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May’s work with 1971’s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd’s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May’s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking.  410 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987)A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its’ many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (“Don’t you threaten me with a dead fish!” etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson’s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (“Look at my tongue, it’s wearing a yellow sock.”) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties.510 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971)A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its’ release, Harold and Maude’s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn’t get past Harold’s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour  lies a rather warm and moving film.Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady’s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who’s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie’s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing’s greatest works.One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers’ trademark dark humour and lives up to its’ blurb: “a lot can happen in the middle of nowhere”. MASH fully deserves its’ exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its’ time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn’t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH’s intended targets – the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation’s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry.910 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949)Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class ide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film “a hilarious study in the gentle art of murder”. Price’s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing’s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made.1010 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (“Dimitri, we have a little problem...”) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people’s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.110 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003)The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall’s stores.

It was a message to a publisher asking him to send a copy of Bloom’s latest book,\u0026nbspPossessed by Memory, a memoir mediated through literature, “to the magnificent British actress, Dame Janet Suzman”.I’m visiting Harold Bloom, America’s venerable and semi-omniscient literary critic, at his beautiful old wooden house on a leafy street in New Haven, where – having just celebrated his 89th birthday – he is still teaching. Via Skype. He’s a bit too frail to be allowed on the Yale campus (they say the insurance won’t cover him).\u0026nbsp“What was your high point then, looking back over your life?”“Ah, Dame Janet,” he sighs.After 40-odd years, he is still in love with Janet Suzman. His wife, Jeanne, is sitting right there by the way. She doesn’t mind. I should stress one thing (in fairness to all concerned): Bloom and Suzman have never met. Unless you count across a very crowded auditorium. She was playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre some time in the late 1970s. Harold Bloom was in the audience (as, by a strange coincidence, was I). For Harold, it was the coup de foudre. He was too shaken by the whole experience to ever articulate his passion, until a year or two back when I finally put the two of them in touch, over email.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

She will remain forever exactly as she was on stage, dressed as an Egyptian queen, her words precisely scripted by William Shakespeare. It is the purest love you can imagine, a literary love affair, based on highly metaphorical language. Cleopatra was in love with Anthony, but for at least that one evening Bloom was Anthony,\u0026nbspeven though he generally thinks of himself as more of a Falstaff, a hedonistic lover of life and adventurer.Harold is not in great shape. He can’t go very far, physically speaking, except for regular trips to the hospital and a rehab clinic. He is wheelchair-bound. His wife says it’s all down to a weak heart and arthritis. He has a nurse attending him while I’m there. He calls out for ice to be put on his back. His hand is trembling as he signs a copy of his book. The last time he wrote to me, he said, with an apocalyptic air, “my future is indeterminate”. Which applies to us all, but especially to Harold.\u0026nbspSuzman in regal headdress as Cleopatra back in 1974 (ITVRex)His word for himself is “decrepit”. His mind is as sharp as ever it was, but inside a body that is in terminal decline. He is suffering from the opposite of dementia: decorporia, or physical disintegration. Mens sana in a corpore that is anything but sano. “There is a tremor in my fingers,” he writes, “my legs tend to give out, my teeth diminish, incipient macular degeneration dims my eyes, deafness increases, birdsong is scarcely heard, every height augments my apprehension of falling.” When he thinks about death, he quotes Dr Johnson: “This secret horrour of the last is inseparable from a thinking being whose life is limited, and to whom death is dreadful.”The Shakespeare cult shoves aside better writers in UK schoolsAll is True review: A fanciful but nuanced portrait of ShakespeareThere is a strange bond between us. My father’s name is also Harold. Middle name “Horatio”, which Bloom in his Shakespearean way is particularly fond of. “I’m old enough to be your father,” he says. I’m a bit of a prodigal symbolic son though. I struggle to remember the books my own father was particularly keen on. “He was more into motorbikes than books, to be honest,” I say.I can do the things that Harold can no longer do: hiking up the mountains of Montana or surfing.\u0026nbsp“Don’t you ever get tired?” he says. In fact he hates going to the beach anyway: “I turn into a lobster when exposed to the sun.” He is content to keep on reading and keep on remembering.There is an implicit and explicit shoutout in his work to Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, merging memory and art with an evanescent impression of immortality. His earliest memory is of playing on the floor of his mother’s kitchen while she prepared the Sabbath meal. As she goes by he reaches out and touches her toes she reaches down and rumples his hair and says, “My sweet Harry”.Now, approaching the end of his story, he likes to quote the Book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 12: “Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the street.” A line in Ecclesiastes which I’ve never heard him quote is this one: “Much study is a weariness of the flesh.” He adheres to the later Jewish tradition (perhaps imported via neoplatonism) of study being the path to salvation.He was born in 1930 in the Bronx, the son of immigrants, and grew up speaking Yiddish. “My father could speak Russian but refused to my mother spoke Polish, but refused to, for political reasons.” He only learned English around the age of six\u0026nbspwhen his older sisters brought it home from school. So he came at it from the outside, rather like Joseph Conrad or Vladimir Nabokov, and was (and remains) bewitched by the language.Suzman\u0026nbspon the Andrew Marr show in March\u0026nbspthis year\u0026nbspshow (Rex)His first reading was of the poets William Blake and Hart Crane, and he came to Shakespeare very early on, around the age of eight\u0026nbspor nine\u0026nbsphe thinks. “When I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for me.” Legend has it that he could read a thousand pages an hour (he says it was only 400 at best).When I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for meHe retains his youthful magical thinking about literature. Bloom has now written 40-something books about books – poetry, novels, plays, sacred texts. And his “memoir” is largely a homage to some of his favourite writers. As Oscar Wilde once said:\u0026nbsp“Criticism is the only civilised form of autobiography.” Bloom harks back to the Bible often enough, but he is (as he describes Marcel Proust) more of “an atheistic mystic”. He quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson with approval: “As men’s prayers are a disease of their will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect.Literature is the closest thing Harold has to a religion. Writers such as\u0026nbspShakespeare and Milton and Wordsworth are like a substitute for the elusive Yahweh of the book of Genesis. Which explains why he retains an essentially sacred view of writing and is concerned to defend the “western canon” (from Homer through to James Joyce) against unbelievers and sceptics (which probably includes me).His attitude could be summed up in the opening lines of John’s Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word (logos), and the Word was with God (theon), and the Word was God.” But he was brought up on the Torah, the Jewish Bible, and was later seduced by the medieval tradition of Kabbalah, which says that the world was called into being via 10\u0026nbsputterances (or “Sefirot”) and that therefore the whole of life is language. Organised religion, monotheism-style, derived from a reverence for the written text.Bloom derives consolation from the books that surround him on shelves and in piles on the table and on the floor. In Possessed by Memory, he writes that “Frequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongest.” If he was a Pharaoh, he would presumably ask to be buried with his books at his side.He met his wife Jeanne in New Haven in 1955. They were both students at Yale. She was doing a degree in history, he had just returned from a year on a Fulbright scholarship at Pembroke College, Cambridge (England). They married in 1958. Now, more than 60 years later, she says:\u0026nbsp“You can’t stop him. Nothing would stop him from continuing to teach and write – it’s what he does.”How my article about young adult literature caused a ‘tweetstorm’Brexit isn’t a new idea, just ask DickensNobel Prize in Literature to be awarded twice this yearHe tends to remember people according to the books or poems they make him think of. So for example, there was a student called Fergy he met at Cornell. She was from Kentucky. “She had freckles and red hair, and I always told her that she looked like a female Huck Finn. Tall, slim, incredibly graceful, she had a way of running around me as we walked, since she was swift and I was slow.” Everything is mediated through literature. “Almost every night I dream about departed friends, sometimes mixing them up with fictive characters.”At this stage of the game – the dreaded “twilight” zone – Bloom has lost most of his old friends. His books are a way of calling them back again. The notion of a resurrection is still important to him – but one that precedes death. It is not surprising, when his own body is failing, if he finds consolation in images of transcendence, in which the soul is at last disembodied:Hence in a season of calm weatherHe quotes from Proust’s account of the death of (his imaginary writer) Bergotte: “They buried him, but all through that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection”.There are perhaps three key concepts that recur again and again in Bloom: freedom, God, and immortality. All three of them appear as delusions, but ones that can be elusively attained or at least entertained in works of literature. Bloom would probably concur with Borges that literature is defined by “the sense of the imminence of a revelation that does not occur”.None of which stops Bloom from forever searching, not just for his own earliest memories but what might be something like the earliest memories of humanity, for what he calls, “a primal sound, cast out of our cosmos and wandering in exile through the interstellar spaces”. One of the stories he is most drawn to in the Old Testament – the Book of Genesis – is that of Jacob, who finds himself wrestling with a passing god all through the night. Bloom sees that – a close encounter with the ine – as an allegory of his own life.“In the half-light of my incessant nocturnal wakefulness, I begin to conceive of it as the struggle of every solitary deep reader to find in the highest literature what will suffice.”\u0026nbspFrequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongestThe “most important thing in the book” he says is his theory of “self-other seeing”, notably in Shakespeare, where characters like Hamlet and Macbeth are capable of seeing themselves from the outside, as if they were someone else – an idea to some extent inspired or inflected by the experience he has had when (more than once) falling and breaking some fragile part of his body: “I recall the repetition of an acute phantasmagoria that this was not happening to me but to some other person.”One of his favourite words is agon, nothing to do with “agony” as such, but definitely concerned with struggle, as if in an arena (like Ben Hurr). He is certainly always struggling with something or someone, whether god or man, or just entropy in general.Finnegans Wake springs to mind.) Books are old school and contrive to hold new school technology at bay. “The final book here, The Book of Numbers, by the still-youthful Joshua Cohen, is a courageous assault on our Age of the Screen, the great grey ocean of the internet.”I quote that from Bright Book of Life: Fifty-Two Novels to Reread ‘Ere I Vanish. While I was hanging out chez Bloom, as well as emailing Dame Janet, I also had to email myself the manuscripts of two other books that Harold has already written but not yet published.Bright Book, the other is Take Arms Against a Sea of Troubles, a study of poetry, or “the power of the reader’s mind over a universe of death”. As his wife says, there is no stopping him. Each book is a way of deferring death, a bulwark against the erosion of time, a “symbol of his resurrection”.In all writers and all times, in philosophers and poets, Bloom finds consolation – companionship – in the face of the void. But if you had to name one, it would have to be Shakespeare, and precariously poised as he is between being and non-being, it would have to be in the figure of Hamlet: “We defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be, ‘tis not to come if it be not to come, it will be now it if be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows aught, what is’t to leave betimes? Let be.”Andy Martin is the author of With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher (Polity) and teaches at the University of CambridgeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He and his organisation loaded the Beresheet lander up with a library that could serve as a summary of life on Earth: 30 million pages of information, samples of human DNA, and the tardigrades.Tardigrades were first discovered in the 18th century, and have fascinated scientists ever since. They are tiny, measuring just half a milimetre long, and are found all around Earth.Much of the reason for the fascination is just how able they are to withstand extreme environments and survive. They have shown the ability to be exposed to very high and low temperatures, intense pressure, as well as being deprived of air, food and water, as well as already demonstrating that they can live after being put in outer space.They do that party by going into a very strange hibernation, where they can switch off a variety of biological processes and then restart them again when they wake back up. They could be doing that on the Moon, scientists warn, ready to be revived when conditions are right.As such, scientists don\u0027t think that the tardigrades will be thriving on the Moon. But they could be waiting there ready to be picked up and revived, they say, and could stay in that state for years.On other planets that could potentially be home to life, Nasa and other space agencies are very careful about contaminating the surface with life from the Earth. But the Moon is considered dead and so restrictions are much less – with Apollo astronauts leaving bacteria there in the fecal matter they dropped on the surface.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its creator,\u0026nbspMathew Roberts, was told it happened for violating community standards but is still mystified about why exactly it happened.What is ‘storm Area 51’ and are alien-hunters about to raid the base?I never got any reason behind the event being removed, Mr Roberts told CNET. I created a sister event which amassed about 15,000 people before being taken down for no reason.Mr Roberts said the removal had caused a problem because he had actually intended to host a festival on 20 September, the day the page had joked the raid would take place. That event would allow people to commemorate the event without being dangerously close to the dangerous base.I think it\u0027s pretty reckless of Facebook, especially because I\u0027m trying to direct people away from storming the base, Mr Roberts said.

We must be ‘greener’ rather than ‘greyer’.”​Speaking ahead of publication, Mr Khan said: “Access to nature should be available to all Londoners regardless of wealth or background.David\u0026nbspLindo’s\u0026nbspvision of bringing nature closer to people is exactly the kind of idea that London needs to ensure we remain one of the greenest cities in the world and face up to the challenge of tackling a climate emergency.”The recommendations are among a series of proposals aiming to stimulate debate ahead of next year’s London mayoral elections.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy... there\u0026nbspare other views within the party but that’s our view.”Labour’s manifesto at the 2017 general election claimed independence in Scotland would “lead to turbocharged austerity for Scottish families”.The document added: “Labour opposes a second Scottish independence referendum. It is unwanted an unnecessary, and we we will campaign tirelessly to ensure Scotland remains part of the UK.”Speaking earlier this year on the issue of a second referendum for Scotland, Mr Leonard said a Labour government would “not agree to to a second independence referendum”.Majority of Scots back independence in shock poll after Johnson visitMr Leonard added if Labour won a general election the party would refuse to grant a “Section 30 order” giving Holyrood the power to hold a second vote on independence.“What we said in the manifesto at the 2017 election was that there is no case for, and we would not support, a second independence referendum.”Following Mr McDonnell’s remarks, a Scottish Labour spokesperson insisted the shadow chancellor was “clearly not advocating a second independence referendum”.\u0026nbsp“He made clear the huge benefit a UK Labour government\u0026nbspwill bring for the people of Scotland”.On Brexit, Mr McDonnell said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would “never” step down if other opposition parties demanded it to form a coalition of national unity.Government accused of playing ‘blame game’ over no-deal BrexitUK’s hopes of good post-Brexit trade deal with US branded ‘delusional’EU prepares for no-deal as PM has ‘no intention’ of renegotiatingNigel Farage cleared by Ofcom for saying Jon Snow ‘should be attacked’The shadow chancellor said:”It won’t happen. I think we’d form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we’d expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don’t we’ll go back to the country.“If they want to vote against a real living wage, if they want to vote against £70bn\u0026nbspworth of investment in Scottish infrastructure, if they want to vote against a green industrial revolution to tackle climate change then so be it, we’ll go back to the people and then let them explain to the people why they wouldn’t support those policies.”“We want to change the world, we’re not going be held back by other parties.”Mr McDonnell’s remarks echoed comments from the party’s senior frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey, who earlier told Channel 4 News that Labour “wouldn’t countenance” a government of national unity.“We think that we need to have a clear majority for a government in parliament, and that’s why we’re calling for a general election,” she said.\u0026nbsp“What we don’t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get out of jail free card.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the slowest rise since the BRC started collecting records in 1995.\u0026nbspIn July alone, sales ticked up 0.3 per cent from a year ago after falls in the previous two months.\u0026nbsp“The UK may have had record temperatures in July, but retail sales were far from record-breaking at just 0.3 per cent growth,” said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, which sponsors the survey.\u0026nbspHe noted that online non-food sales, which have held up particularly well this year, increased by only 3.7 per cent last month – a “considerably” slower rise than in previous years.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Australia\u0027s Nathan Lyon celebrates after taking the wicket of England\u0027s Joe Root during day five of the first Ashes test at Edgbaston.

That followed similarly muted growth in May and June.\u0026nbspJuly’s increase was propped up by spending on entertainment such as cinema tickets for Toy Story 4 and The Lion King.“Spending has remained relatively subdued over the past few months, with an underlying uncertainty about the wider economic and political landscape causing many to hold off making purchases of bigger ticket items,” said Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard.Consumer spending, which makes up over 60 percent of Britain’s GDP, has so far been relatively immune to the Brexit turmoil that has hurt businesses’ revenues and investment.

What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October .However, in early August there was speculation that the new Conservative leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his power base.If a snap election is called, Boris will battle it out to retain his title as PM.It would be a chance for him to understand how confident the British public are in his skills, as his current position as PM was voted for by members of the Conservative Party.A  General Election could see some big changes to the Conservative Party, as it looks like Tories may have to accept the possibility of a No Deal Brexit, and back that in Boris campaign.Johnson would run against Jeremy Corbyn, who lost out to Theresa May in  with  per cent of the UKs vote.However, voices from within and outside the Labour Party are allegedly urging Corbyn to quit as Labour experiences record slumps in polls in the wake of several anti-Semitism scandals.A number of Labour MPs have been rumoured to be gunning to take over from Corbyn in Labours leadership, most notably Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan.Jo Swinson, who took over Lib Dem leadership in July  would also run - Lib Dems currently stand on  per cent in the polls, their strongest result yet.The Scottish National Party , the Democratic Unionist Party , Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru and Green are also very likely to run.Amid the Brexit drama, its likely that Farages Brexit Party could be contenders after Nigel Farage questioned Boris ability to deliver Brexit.The five MPs from Change UK, formerly The Independent Group, and fronted by Heidi Allen could stand for their new party in their constituencies but risk losing their seats.General Elections have to be held at least every five years in the UK.Previously elections could be called simply by the Prime Minister going to the Queen at any point within five years of the last one.But after the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed in  the five-year gap was enshrined in law.The act states that General Elections are to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years.However, it has two provisos for the polls opening early.Firstly: A motion of no confidence passed in Her Majesty’s Government by a simple majority and  days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed.And Secondly: A motion for a General Election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats .The next General Election in the United Kingdom is scheduled to be held on May , , under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .The date of the last General Election was June , , which saw the Conservatives lose their majority but remain in Government after they struck a deal with the DUP.The next General Election is scheduled for  - provided Boris Johnson doesnt call a snap election.A snap election could be calledthere is a Remainer revolt against a No Deal Brexit.Labour leader Corbyn has vowed to call a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnsons Government that could trigger an election.If a majority of MPS agree they have no confidence in Johnsons administration, then attempts can be made to form another regime either under Corbyn or a cross-party “government of national unity”.If no viable alternative can be found after  days, a general election is triggered – although Johnson would still get to set the date and could therefore hold the poll after taking the UK out of the EU.Askedhe was preparing to fight an election after losing a confidence vote, the Prime Minister insisted: “No. The answer is no.Britain isnt due a national election until .Theresa May called a shock snap election in  to try and strengthen the Conservatives hold on Parliament, but it backfired when her majority was slashed by  seats."},{"url":null,"title":"uk general election what bookies oods latest","story":"The inscrutable Tory bigwig could be wanting to bring a vote to the people shortly after a No Deal Brexit.

That shows that all of this is nothing but a pretext.Defence analysts say Chinas large arsenal of land-based intermediate-range missiles are intended primarily to degrade Taiwans defences, target Guam and other key US bases in the region.Those are typied by the advanced DF- intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of lofting both conventional and nuclear warheads, the latter to carry out a rapid retaliatory strike, and the DF-D, which is built to take out an aircraft carrier.And while China argues its nukes are small in number and purely for defensive purposes, major technological upgrades made by Beijing offer fresh arguments for why it should be included in future treaties, said Collin Koh, a regional security expert at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.The INF Treaty signed by Russia and the US in  expired Friday, with Washington saying it withdrew because of Moscow’s alleged violations of the pact.Russia denies breaching the terms.Some observers say the real reason was a perceived need to counter Chinas advances in missile technology and restore a balance in light of lingering questions over the effectiveness of anti-missile defence systems.The end of the INF Treaty comes amid rising doubts about whether the two countries will extend an agreement on long-range nuclear weapons scheduled to expire in  known as New START.Trump said he has been discussing a new agreement to reduce nuclear weapons with China and Russia.And I will tell you China was very, very excited about talking about it and so was Russia, Trump told reporters. So I think well have a deal at some point.Asked about Trumps comments, Fu said he didnt wish to contradict Trump, but repeated that China has no interest and, frankly, we dont think we are even in a position to participate in a trilateral negotiation aimed at a nuclear arms reduction."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle baby shower sneaked attention","story":"Documents from the US State Department show how the Duchess of Sussex wanted to change the “optics” of her departure from five-star The Mark Hotel in New York.According to the report: “The VIP [Meghan] explained that her intent was to change the literal optics of the departure, making it appear that she was at least attempting to sneak out of the hotel in photos rather than exiting through the main entrance and giving the potential impression that she was enjoying the media attention.”But her demand to leave the hotel out of a service entrance meant vehicles had to be moved to line up at that door -

and the paparazzi - can see inside.But she erted, and instead went to eat at Cafe Boulud at The Surrey Hotel.The documents also revealed that diplomatic officials conducted a full terrorist and internet threat assessment of Meghan to determineshe was at risk for an attack.The Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis said the chance of an attack was low – but it didnt rule out the possibility of harassment from an “emotionally disturbed person”.It read: “Many members of the royal family are very easily recognized personalities therefore, they are attractive targets for those seeking notoriety.”The Diplomatic Security Service also conducted a Protective Intelligence Review assessing any threats that had been made online.Meghan flew to New York and back in a £million private jet owned by the Clooneys."},{"url":null,"title":"hercules lands beach raf","story":"The C-J transporter battled heavy showers and a strong cross wind to make the unusual touchdown yesterday at Cefn Sidan Sands, near Pembrey,.Former RAF engineer Ally McMurdo took photos of the aircraft, which was flown by  Squadron, based at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.Ally, , who served in the RAF between  and , said: “The crews conduct natural surface landings such as this to enable them to support British Operations across the globe.“The training allows them to prepare for not only delivering troops and equipment to austere theatres of conflict but also to deliver aid to unprepared strips during humanitarian relief operations.“The crews also conduct this training at night with night vision goggles enabling them to operate around the clock.Yesterday was a great example of the professionalism of aircrew, with a strong cross wind and heavy showers to contend with. “Ally, from Swansea, who now works as a high-speed train driver, spent his final tour working on the Hercules aircraft and got into photography two years ago.The Hercules has the ability to airdrop a iety of stores and paratroopers.Its crew consists of two pilots and a ground engineer.To conduct its missions Hercules crews are highly skilled in low-level flying.The two versions of the C-J in service are ft in and ft in long with wingspan of ft in.Its four RollsRoyce turboprop engines allow it to fly at up to ,ft.The C-J can carry up to  infantry,  paratroopers,  pallets or  medical stretchers.The Lockheed Martin C- first flew in  and entered service with the United States Air Force in .It joined the RAF in  when it was given the title Hercules and it became the backbone of its transport fleet.The aerial workhorse played a part in the Falklands War in  during which it carried supplies to Ascension Island.The more powerful C-J model was ordered in  and began flying with the RAF in .As well as  Squadron it is also flown by  Squadron,  Squadron and the Falcons parachute display team.The venerable aircraft is due to be remain in service until  when it will be replaced by the AM."},{"url":null,"title":"britains longest married couple 80 years","story":"The pair, aged  and , wed in August  and have not had a night apart since World War Two.

Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.What on earth is happening to this country  Entire communities feel they have been abandoned by the police while criminal gangs rule by fear – and no one in power seems to know what to do about it.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians.

An absolute nightmare.Ive not been able to go anywhere and Whaley is so quiet. Everyone in Whaley has been amazing. Its not easy.Asked what it was like to be one of the first to be let back in, she said: Its great. I can finally get some sleep. I just cant wait to get back in my flat.Im happy but on the other side Im gutted for those who cant come back.They joined  diehard locals in the Horwich End area who defied the evacuation order to stay - despite repeated pleas by cops for them to leave as there is still a “risk to le”.Dep Ch Cons Swann said: “We will repeatedly visit these people to remind them of the risks they are posing to themselves and emergency responders.“However there is no specic legislation under which we can force these people to leave.”The four determined families all live next to each other in Horwich End - and claim the slow trickle of people back into the area has proved they were right to stay.Malcolm Venton, , who stayed with partner Lorraine Ellis, , told MailOnline: Its vindicated us really, I felt that we were never in much danger and thats proven to be the case.A police woman this morning asked meI was was one of those refusing to move and I sad yes.She said that I was foolish and told me well be the ones who have to retrieve your bodies.We were only just within the evacuation zone andanything were to happen, I had a bag packed and the car parked outside to drive literally  yards or so up the hill to the safe area.It didnt seem worth all the hassle of moving out to a temporary shelter, particularly as one of our border collies, Meg, is sick at the moment and is limping and so hardly able to move.All that upheaval wouldnt have been fair on her.It is feared looters could hit the area with Derbyshire Police patrolling the ghost town with drones.The dam wall has been packed with  tonnes of aggregate which is being cemented into place to reinforce the spillway.Derbyshire Police said: “Once a level has been reached - and is able to be maintained - engineers will view the damage to the wall and a decision will be made regarding when it is safe for evacuated residents and businesses toto Whaley Bridge.”Fire chiefs have said specialist engineers have monitored the dam wall  hours a day with lasers and are reassured by their assessment.An RAF Chinook helicopter was used again yesterday to move sandbags in a bid to maximise the dam’s integrity.RAF Regional Liaison Officer for the North West, Wing Commander Gary Lane, said: The work we have done is just finding its feet.When you put a load of aggregate down it needs stamping in, weve not been able to flatten that because it has just been dropped.He said about  military personnel had been drafted in to help with the dam.Addressing what would happen once people are given the green light tohome, Ms Swann said all cordons would be lted and roads would go back to normal.In the meantime, she insisted that security measures were still in force in the area after reports of burglaries and prowlers.Ms Swann said: We can assure you that security of the area continues. We are using drones regularly to patrol the area.Members of the public at the meeting in Chapel High School, Chapel-en-le-Frith, were also told the dam would eventually have to be rebuilt.A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: We are very much in the emergency phase now and we are currently repairing and carrying out construction work.It is a long-term construction project, but we will not have started from scratch.

a Leave supporter who was promoted to the Cabinet to replace David Davis when he quit in protest at Mays Brexit plans - is among a group of senior ministers thought to be unhappy with the agreement.He was closely involved in drafting the agreement, which sets out the terms of Britains departure from the EU.Raab said in his resignation letter in November  that he could not support it because the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.And, he added, the backstop arrangements aimed at preventing theof a hard Irish border would result in the EU holding a veto over our ability to exit.Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manesto at the last election, he told the Prime Minister.Esther McVey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, quit on November , , and told the PM: Your deal does not honour the result of the referendum.In her resignation letter, McVey told the Prime Minister that she could “no longer support” the deal.She wrote: “Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy.“This deal fails to do this.”Also on November , Shailesh Vara quit as minister of state for Northern Ireland, saying he cannot support Mrs Mays agreement.He said the proposal leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation.Conservative Brexiteer MP Anne Marie Morris said she believed enough Tory MPs had now sent letters to the chairman of the  committee to trigger a leadership contest.Blasting the Northern Irish backstop as not what the British people voted for, Suella Braverman resigned from her post as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.The Fareham MP said the Northern Ireland backstop is not Brexit and it threatens to break up our precious union, which she said could have been avoided.The Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party resigned his position after seeing the draft EU Withdrawal Agreement and listening to your statement in the House.Rehman Chishti also stepped down from his role as Trade Envoy to Pakistan.The MP for Gillingham and Rainham said he very much enjoyed the roles but found it shocking that the British Government is failing to put into practice the core values that our country stands for.MP for North East Hampshire, Ranil Jayawardena, quit his post as Parliamentary Private Secretary for Department for Work and Pensions.He said in his resignation letter that it is important to deliver on the democratic decision of the people... and that is why, with regret, I must offer my resignation.He added that the deal does not deliver a good and fair Brexit.Anne-Marie Trevelyan submitted her letter of resignation from the post of Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department of Education.The MP for Berwick upon Tweed said: As an MP bordering Scotland, the regulatory framework agreement for Northern Ireland is very important to me, and I cannot support the position the EU agreement takes.The brother of Boris Johnson quit as transport minister on November , .Johnson warned the UK was barrelling towards an incoherent orce and called for another referendum on the final terms of Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The reality is that maybe she only has time for one more.But, whether it’s for the environment or not, I don’t blame him for not wanting more than two children.I have two and the very idea of having had a third makes me feel weary. I’m just thinking of the sheer volume of childcare, laundry and meals required by each additional child.Sure, when it comes to considering whether two children is “enough”, Harry, left, and Meghan are dealing with dferent considerations to most of us.With hordes of staff, including nannies, cleaners and drivers, they could have multiple children and outsource ALL of the dficult stuffthey wanted to.But Harry and Meghan want to be hands-on parents — which can become exponentially harder with each child you have.Historically, there is pressure on Royal family members to have multiple kids.But, as with many other royal traditions, Harry and Meghan are planning to go their own way. And I commend them for that.I also think Harry should be applauded for speaking up about climate change, especially as this week the Met Office confirmed that the hottest years on record have occurred in the past ten years.So why shouldn’t he use his very public  to talk about things that matter to him and to try to inspire others But, as is often the case, this royal couple seem to be damnedthey do and damnedthey don’t.They’ve already learned the hard way — with their wedding their handling of Archie’s birth and their choice of residence — that you can’t please all the people all of the time.And that, in a way, is a liberation. Because all that is left is to please yourselves.  By ignoring pressures about how many children they “should” have, they are going to have as many as they damn well please.Although why they have to announce it is another question.

Apart from anything , you don’t know what your kids will ­contribute to the world.WhatThomas Edison’s parents had given up after two  .

For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to keep the backstop first if he wants better deal before october 31","story":"The European Commission said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not up for negotiation” in a statement today.Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a news briefing in Brussels: “So far it...remains unchanged - this position that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation but we are open to talk about the political declaration.“And of course we are willing to talk and engage with Prime Minister Johnson.”The PM has so far refused to hold talks with EU chiefs and will not compromise on his stance against Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the Commission’s “business” to play a “blame game”.She added: “Our business is to prepare for a no deal.“Both sides negotiated with the very best intentions and the very best efforts. The outcome on the table is the best deal possible and I dont think that there is any fault or blame to be looked for in this.“We just simply expect the UK to live up to its commitment to avoiding a hard border while protecting Irelands place in the internal market.”However, despite Andreeva saying the EU was open to meeting Boris, the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said there will be no new deal.But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called on EU leaders to give Barnier the mandate to re-broker an agreement, otherwise no-deal is coming down the tracks.Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider thisthey too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, No Deal is coming down the tracks, Barclay wrote in the Mail on Sunday.It is our firm view that Irish border issues should be dealt with in talks on the future agreement between the UK and the EU -- where they should always have been -- and were ready to negotiate in good faith on this basis.The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block in the Brexit talks and one of the reasons why Britains parliament rejected the deal three times.Johnson has vowed to get rid of the backstop and the new government has taken a hard line with the EU, saying it was turbo-boosting preparations for a no-deal Brexitthe bloc fails to agree alternative arrangements for the border.Barclay said officials were working on those arrangements.We have already started work across Whitehall to find the solutions, and they can and will be found, in the context of the free trade agreement we will negotiate with the EU after October , he wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove eu brexit talks","story":"The leading Cabinet minister said it was “wrong and sad” that the EU did not want to discuss a new deal with the UK.His comments came after European leaders finally realised that Boris is serious about leaving without an agreement – but still do not want to offer a new solution to the Irish border problem.Speaking after a meeting of the daily Brexit “war cabinet”, Mr Gove said: “I’m deeply saddened the EU now seem to be refusing to negotiate with the UK.“The Prime Minister’s been clear, he wants to negotiate a good deal with the European Union and he will apply all the energy of the government and ensure that in a spirit of friendliness we can negotiate a new deal.”Mr Gove – who as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is in charge of No Deal preparations across Government – added: “At the moment it’s the EU that seems to be saying they’re not interested’, they’re simply saying, ‘no, we don’t want to talk’.“Well I think that’s wrong and sad, it’s not in Europe’s interest.”On a visit to Belfast, Ireland’s premier repeated the EU’s line that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened.Leo Varadkar said that a No Deal exit was not guaranteed, however.“There are many ways by which a No Deal can be avoided.

Now a cousin of the convicted killer - who was jailed for at least  years - has revealed Porton would steal from her grandmother as a teenager, lash out viciously at her siblings and later bragged about how much she earned as a prostitute. She alienated herself from the rest of her family by refusing to visit her grandmother on her deathbed - and then snubbed her funeral days later, leaving her loved ones furious with her selfishness. The cousin said Porton should face the death penalty for her crimes.    The mum murdered her adorable children because they got in the way of her sex le, jurors at her murder trial were told. The relative - who declined to be named because the family has already been targeted by trolls - toldthat Porton grew up in a close-knit family, but was always an outsider. Every Sunday as a child, Porton would be taken to visit her grandmother, Joy. The cousin said: To be honest she was never a normal child. We were always close as a family, but she never wanted to get involved. We always used to meet at my nanaposs, but sheaposd just stand there and give you a horrible look.    If anyone sat near her sheaposd say aposgo away or Iaposll smash your faceapos, and then sheaposd just walk out. And there were early signs that Porton had a vicious streak. Her cousin continued: As kidswe were going to fight weaposd just fight, but sheaposd dig in her nails when no-one was looking. She knew how to be sly from a young age. She was very manipulative. Joy, who died in April , always had misgivings about Porton, the cousin claimed - fuelled further when the youngster began stealing from her when she was around .  She said thereaposs just something about that child, she always had an ill feeling, the cousin said. My nan was always a good judge of character, when you introduced her to new partners she could always tellsomeone wasnapost right, and sheaposd turn out to be right. Her grandmother began to notice things going missing whenever Porton visited her - but was met with a furious reaction when she asked about it. Every time she left my nan would say such-and-such has gone from the table, the cousin said. Nan asked hershe was taking things, but she just said: aposIf you accused me of that Iaposll never come around again.apos  She was quite an angry child, and it got worse when she was a teenager. She was always after money. Louise never apologised for anything. Porton was often violent toward her cousin when she was young, the relative claimed. She was violent, she would try and hurt us without people seeing, she said. When we went to our nanaposs sheaposd never interact with anyone, she just used to stare. When the killer was , her cousin claimed, her mum Sharon walked out on her to be with another man, leaving her dad to raise the three children alone. She said Louise cut her mum off for years, and was deeply affected by what happened.  As she got older, her cousin said family members became worried about her relationships with men, as she started showing signs of the sex addiction thought to have motivated the killings years later. Once she started sleeping with people, she was sleeping with anyone and everyone, anyone showing her attention, especiallythey had money, the relative said. I told her she needs to think about what sheaposs doing, but she said: aposI know what Iaposm doing, I know how to look after myself.apos The dficult relationship with her family came to a head when Joy became ill and doctors said she was not going to recover. Despite knowing her grandmother had just hours to live, Porton refused to visit her, and later snubbed the funeral as well. Her cousin said: When nan was in hospital she was the only one who wouldnapost come. I contacted Louise and told her theyaposve given nan less than  hours but she said aposI canapost make itapos.  I told her it was her last chance, she said aposI heard what you said, but Iaposm not comingapos. I just put the phone down, I was so emotional. And Porton, who had recently given birth to Lexi, said she could not attend the funeral a week later, claiming she was breastfeeding. I rang her the night before the funeral, she said she wasnapost coming because she was breastfeeding Lexi, the relative said. I said I would organise a private area for her, but she said no. The whole family was disgusted, they cut her off after that because she was so selfish.  She was always there when my nan was giving out pocket money, but she wasnapost there when she needed her. As a result of the feud, the cousin never met Portonaposs younger daughter, Scarlett. Things got worse, she said, when she spotted Porton bragging on Facebook about how much money she could make by selling sex. Appalled, the cousin messaged her, but never received a reply. She said: I messaged her on Facebook and about it, I told her she was disgusting. She never replied to that message, I told her sheaposs a disgrace and nan would be turning in her grave. In spite of the feud, Portonaposs cousin said she sent her a message when she heard Lexi had died in January last year. Lexi died on January  last year, little more than two weeks before Scarlett was killed on February .  Lexi was so sweet, she was a lovely cute thing, Portonaposs cousin said. When I heard sheaposd died I messaged Louise and said I was so sorry for her loss, but she never replied. But she knew something wasnapost right when she learned of Scarlettaposs death. I said to my mum that something isnapost right, how can you lose two babies in two weeks  she revealed. On Friday a judge at Birmingham Crown Court handed Porton a le sentence, with a minimum term of  years - meaning she will be in her s when she becomes eligible for parole.

Even a small cut would make a huge dference. Since seven out of  alcoholic drinks served in a pub are beer, cutting beer duty is one way to relieve pressure, keep pubs open and protect jobs.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development.

Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

Scotlandrsquos forthcoming depositscheme.Every year, people in the Scottish Borders go through . million plastic bottles.And an estimated , of those plastic bottles are littered around the Borders each year.Under the new scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic, glass bottles, and aluminium or steel cans.People will then get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.That p is hoped to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials mentioned.This would mean nearly , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Scottish Borders each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.Jill Farrell, Chief Operating Officer, Zero Waste Scotland said: ldquoOur new figures reveal how Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Borders.ldquoWe all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.ldquoAnd the great thing about Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles, take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.ldquoLitter isnrsquot just an eyesore ndash it also pollutes our environment and seas.ldquoAnd for every bottle littered, more plastic must be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions.ldquoWhen you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, yoursquoll not just be getting your p back, yoursquoll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.All types of drinks in containers between  ml and  litres in size are included in the Deposit Return scheme.Across Scotland, wherever people can buy a drink in a container made from one of these materials, they will also be able toit to reclaim the deposit.Online retailers will also be included in the scheme, ensuring

Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms.

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events.

in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"work-long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-set-start-soon","story":"The

He said: \"It will be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide that.\"They will take a view about whether they want another referendum.

We would let the Scottish people decide.

The Scottish Government has a crystal clear mandate to give them that choice.\"Polling this week shows that they want that choice sooner rather than later - with a majority in favour of the opportunities of independence.\"For any Westminster government to deny that would be a democratic outrage, and Tory posturing on the issue is completely unsustainable.ldquoWe trust this position will now receive the fulsome backing of Richard Leonard and Scottish Labour.Former Scottish Labour MP Pamela Nash, chief executiveof Scotland in Union, said: \"The Shadow Chancellor is right to say that Scotlandrsquos future is in Scotlandrsquos hands ndash and we have chosen to remain in the UK.ldquoThat does not mean that we should have another isive referendum so soon after a once-in-a-generation contest, and the very last thing Scotland needs is another layer of constitutional chaos.\"Labourrsquos  General Election manesto was clear that the party opposes another referendum.ldquoIt is also deeply disappointing to hear that the Shadow Chancellor does not appear to understand that Scottish people are fully represented in two parliaments.\"The House of Commons is where representatives of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland come together to work in the interests of everyone in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"wrong-hard-high-earners","story":"That would be the Shadow Chancellorrsquos reactionyou were to tell him that the sun rises in the east, that dogs are generally four-legged, or any other basic fact, unless itrsquos the historical evidence that the policies he advocates have failed with catastrophic effects on every single one of the numerous occasions they have been implemented.This particular report has received attention because it suggests that an increasing proportion of the top one per cent of earners ndash around three-fths ndash are concentrated in London and the south-east of England. The only places with similar numbersof the very well-off are Aberdeen and Cambridge.I donrsquot suppose that itrsquos news that the worldrsquos most important financial centre and the area immediately around it should contain people on high salaries than other parts of the country. Concern about the disproportionate strength of Londonrsquos economy, compared with other parts of the UK, is hardly the exclusive preserve of Mr McDonnell, either. It may be why the Government keeps banging on about its fatuous ldquoNorthern Powerhouse strategy.In any case, you can hardly blame Westminsterthe economy of the UK outside England fails to match Londonrsquos, since the economic levers are in the hands of the devolved governments. Nowhere is this more true than Scotland which, as well as controlling almost everything except defence and foreign policy from Holyrood, even has the power to y taxation.Itrsquos not just the cost of living which makes things relative: a middle-aged man in London who earns pound, is in the top one per cent nationally to be in the top one per cent of middle-aged male Londoners, however, he would have to earn pound,.Plenty of bits of London are not the preserve of the super-rich, though. Mr McDonnell, who earns about pound, plus expenses, represents a constituency where wages are lower than the national ndash not just the Greater London ndash average, and itrsquos well-off compared with some other parts of London: its averages for poverty and employment are better than the cityrsquos as a whole.Very few people outside the Communist Party of Britainor Mr McDonnellrsquos household think that it is possible, or,theyrsquove considered the matter at all, desirable that inequality should be eradicated altogether. But itrsquos reasonable to feel that hugely disproportionate incomes may have a isive or corrosive effect. Yet the gap between the top one per centand the top . per cent is hugely bigger than the gap between the average income and the top  per cent, or between the top  per cent and the top one per cent.What Mr McDonnell seems not to have noticed from this IFS report is that it shows that the current system already has a substantial impact on income inequality. A quarter of those in the top one per cent income bracket this year, for example, will not be in it next year. That suggests social mobility it also seems plausible that many people make the calculation that theyrsquod be better off making less money outside London than living and working there.Another factor is that those who run a business have atax advantage over those who draw a salary. That seems reasonable, given the risks of running a business, and the fact that those who do so more or less have to generate growth, as not all salaried employees do.The staggering bit, which Mr McDonnell in his shock seems not to have noticed, is that the UK now has the highest number of people ever who pay absolutely no income tax at all. Whatrsquos more, while the top one per cent in terms of income take in  per cent of total earnings, they stump up  per cent of the total income tax take.To put it another way, this one per cent is paying the entirety of the NHS and defence budgets added together on their own, while  per cent of the population pay nothing in income tax. Thatrsquos shockingly disproportionate, but you may regard it as a reasonably balanced redistributive tax system that is fairer, and certainly more effective, than the Venezuelan model Mr McDonnell favours."},{"url":null,"title":"need-alternative-path-without-exams","story":"MY daughter, like thousands of teenagers in Scotland, spent her summer anxiously waiting for the dreaded ldquoresults day. After years of work, it all comes down to a high-stakes exam which, she thinks, will be of critical importance to the rest of her le.Efforts to develop student-centred, challenging, deep, relevant, engaging, collaborative learning can be compromised as students enter exam years. Watching my daughter go through this crystallised my belief that reproducing passively-absorbed selected facts for high-stake exams does not produce the skills and values which will see her thrive.Scotland faces many educational challenges: deteriorating national and international educational statistics, a record number of students with additional support needs, a rise in mental health issues and critical skills shortages. Strategic consultancy firm Accenture recently reported that failure to close the digital skills gap over the next  years could cost the UK economy pound. billion in GDP growth. Do high-stake exams still fulfil a purpose in our rapidly changing world Exams test how much you remember, understand and apply. These skills can be easily automated in a world where information can be accessed ubiquitously and instantaneously. We must instead prioritise the ability to analyse, evaluate and create.The jobs in which the youngest generation will work do not yet exist. As shown in the global  Economic Forum Future Jobs report, the advancement of Articial Intelligence , Internet of Things , cybersecurity, machine learning, robotics, blockchain, automation,Augmented Reality , and Virtual Realitywill require  per cent of the workforce to signicantly re- and upskill in the next three years. In a reality where change is the only certainty, the constant development of competences is crucial.Nations around the world are taking steps to prepare students for an uncertain future. In China, Chen Jining, the Minister for Educational Reform, has a mission to develop ldquocreative, innovative students who are willing to take risks, try new things and think for themselves. He is working with the worldrsquos leading innovative educational environment, the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to create more of these pupils, which he refers to as ldquoX-students.Media Labrsquos associate director Mitchel Resnick believes education should be a ldquoLelong Kindergarten full of fun and exploration through the four Ps: Projects, Peers, Passion and Play. Resnick argues our current model of discrete knowledge acquisition and examinations is disengaging students and killing creativity.Scotland can also learn from Finland. In , the countryrsquos education system in Finland shted its focus to ldquophenomenon-based learning which encourages students to investigate relevant, real-le challenges through interdisciplinary learning. Using authentic learning, curiosity, questioning, critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration, students construct knowledge for themselves.My challenge for the last  years has been to instil a love of learning. We owe it to future generations to at least consider an alternative path without exams. I understand the concerns. Without exams, academic rigour could be compromised, standards could fall, and pupils could be unable to cope with the anxiety of competition. But what about the opportunities Students who feel academia is ldquonot their thing could be more engaged. Learning could be fun instead of stressful and pupils could be intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated. Education could cultivate a love of learning and pursuit of passion.

Not quite up there with the existence or otherwise of Nessie, or what happened to the Flannan Island lighthouse keepers, but a head-scratcher nevertheless.To wit: why would any broadcaster, with the worldrsquos largest arts bash happening on its own turf, and its own homegrown presenters, feel the need to fly half of North London to the Scottish capital to front its Edinburgh festivals coverage This year it is dferent, to some extent. Although British Airways is still set to do a roaring trade in meeja types heading to Edinburgh in August, Scottish broadcasters are being given more airtime to show what they can do. STV is having a run of five episodes of its Whatrsquos On Scotland show on Fridays, while the new BBC Scotland channel is leading its coverage with nine episodes of The Edinburgh Show, presented by Janice Forsyth and Grant Stott.The latter is a buy one radio show, get one TV programme affair, with BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos regular two hour Afternoon Show filmed, cut to  minutes, and shown the day after. Basically, itrsquos a reheat. Depending on how generous you feel, this is either a swizz along the lines of flogging repeats as ldquoanother chance to see, or an efficient use of resources. Either way,this works we can expect to see more of it: all those hours on the new channel are not going to fill themselves.For last nightrsquos show, Janice ldquoDonrsquot Call Me a National Treasure Forsyth was in the presenterrsquos chair, which was a smart move. Forsyth always takes her show to Edinburgh in August. She is as comfy before a live audience as she is in a studio on her lonesome. The only thing she did not appear at ease with was the heavy makeup someone thought she needed, this being telly and all. One day TV producers will accept that there wonrsquot be rioting in the streetsmiddle aged women, like middle aged men, appear on screen without the contents of an entire make-up counter on their faces.Producers also won a watch with Craig Ferguson as the first bod on the sofa. Having had his own late night show in the US, he was right at home mucking in with the other guests, who included the comedians Fern Brady and Al Murray and the creators of the play How Not to Drown, the true story of an -year-old boy who fled the war in Kosovo to seek asylum in the UK. There was music besides. It was a decent,comedian heavy, mix, a bit like the festivals in general.An hour was too long, and it is dficult to see why there is a dayrsquos time lag between the radio show and the TV broadcast - it cannot take that much time to edit. Still, what do you know, it appears Scotland can not only host the worldrsquos biggest arts festival, but Scottish broadcasters, like Scottish newspapers, can do a pretty good job of telling Scots about it, too."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10241172.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-aberdeen-launching-tap-cap-offer-easier-payment-options-bus-travel","story":"First Aberdeen is the largest bus operator in the city with more than  buses and coaches carrying more than  million passengers across Aberdeen in the past  months.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar drop red lines and then we can talk about new brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think that is wrong and sad.”On Tuesday evening, at a political discussion in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said calls by Sinn Fein for a border poll in the event of a no-deal Brexit were “isive”.He added: “I think it would result in some of the mistakes made  years ago, when partition happened, being repeated but just the other way around – a huge number of people, those from a unionist, British, Ulster background, being brought into a united Ireland against their will.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38382344.ece/9e80d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Gilmour.jpg","title":"antrim man to finally scatter parents ashes which were lost by aer lingus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His father, Sam Gilmour, met his English mother during the Second World War.The family made the decision to travel to Europe this summer after his daughter was invited to train with the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Milan, Italy.Mr Gilmour decided to extend the trip and scatter his parents ashes in their hometowns to respect their last wishes.\"We thought since she’s been invited to do that and I had my mum and my dads ashes sitting in boxes on the mantelpiece - this is the opportunity. All four of us will go and we will take mum and dad home, easy peasy,\" he said.The family organised two ceremonies with the help of relatives, one in Ballymena and one in Birmingham, to lay his parents to rest this week.The family of four were due to spend five days in Ireland before flying to England for his mothers funeral ceremony but when they arrived in Dublin from Milan on Saturday they found that Aer Lingus had lost all of their luggage.\"We got here, the bags didn’t, and since then it’s been just a nightmare,\" Mr Gilmour said.The airline were able to locate two of the four lost bags on Monday and thankfully, a spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday evening that the remaining luggage has been found.\"Aer Lingus can confirm that the missing baggage has been located in Milan Malpensa Airport.

She said: \"I have a wedding to get to, so this just isnt a case of postponing a weekend away. I think Ill just have to get the next flight out of Gatwick but honestly its a lot of extra cash to cover before I get to claim insurance.\" Meanwhile, images on social media showed long queues of holidaymakers at airports and error messages on the BA app. The airline said the systems issue had resulted in delays and cancellations from London airports. It is offering short-haul passengers departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City the chance to re-book to another day between Thursday and next Tuesday. A spokesman said: \"We are working as quickly as possible to resolve a systems issue which has resulted in some short-haul cancellations and delays from London airports. \"A number of flights continue to operate but we are advising customers to check ba for the latest flight information before coming to the airport.\" BA is using back-up and manual systems to try to cope with the problems. A major computer failure hit the airline over spring bank holiday weekend in May , standing tens of thousands of passengers and costing owner AIG around £ million. The airline cancelled  flights due to a power failure, sparking a raft of compensation claims for flight costs, train and hotel expenses, replacement clothes and toiletries. The GMB union blamed the meltdown on cost-cutting and the outsourcing of hundreds of IT jobs, which was denied by BA. More recently, it has faced troubles including threatened strikes by its pilots. The airline is also set to be fined £ million over a cyber attack on its security systems last year in which the personal data of up to , customers was stolen. On the trains, services will ert to London Bridge where possible, with travellers advised to Thameslink or other Southern services where available, National Rail Enquiries said. Tickets can be used for alternative transport on London buses, some Thameslink services, and the London Underground. The cause of the trackside fire was not stated."},{"url":null,"title":"northern irelandborn chaplain to britains worst football team misses the moment players finally put an end to their 73game run without","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was away on church business.He said: \"I only got back to Fort William around what would have been half-time. And I didnt bother going to the match.\"But it was fantastic to hear that the barren streak was over. Supporters have been euphoric. And its been amazing to see the response all over the world to the win.\"The club has gained thousands of fans on the internet and Fort Williams merchandise sells across the globe.News of the overdue win has delighted people far and wide.\"The congratulations have been coming in from everywhere,\" added Mr Baxter, who never lost faith - even when Fort William were routinely shipping  and  goals every other Saturday.And while he has stopped short of calling the win over Nairn County a miracle, he says it is a fitting reward for the clubs determination to keep going in the face of adversity.Internal wrangling has also caused dficulties at Fort William, but a new board have vowed to push the club forward.Despite the horric results of the last few years, new-found fans have been known to travel thousands of miles to watch Fort William, whose ground at Claggan Park is one of the most picturesque in the UK - sitting at the foot of Ben Nevis.Mr Baxter, who used to attend the occasional Bangor FC game at Clandeboye Park in his youth, said he has always been proud to be associated with Fort William, whose away games in the Highland League to clubs like Wick Academy and Cove Rangers can involve five-hour drives.According to Mr Baxter, the small population in the Fort William area and the competition from the Scottish game shinty made it hard in the past for the club to attract new players, who are paid a maximum of £ a week.But this season a deal has been done with Scottish Championship side Inverness Caledonian Thistle to lend Fort William young players. Six of them featured in the line-up against Nairn County.Another three players are also on loan with the team, who denied the Caley Thistle arrangement amounted to a take-over.The hapless Highlanders have become an internet sensation with thousands of followers keeping up with their every move ... and defeat.And the Nairn result was greeted with a flood of overjoyed messages on social media, with one fan David Childs posting: \"What a time to be alive.\"The Scottish National Partys Westminster leader Ian Blackford even got in on the act, tweeting: \"Heartfelt congratulations to Fort William FC on an emphatic victory after an -day wait.\"The Fort William manager Russell McMorran has said he wont allow the Nairn success to go to his players heads. And his down-to-earth caution has been endorsed by Rev Baxter, a former Bangor Grammar School pupil who left Northern Ireland in  to study in Scotland and Oxford before becoming a tax inspector. He then worked for an accountancy firm before training for the ministry.Married with two children, Mr Baxter is a former Scottish Universities table tennis champion.He said his ambition is still to see Fort William winning a football match, adding: \"Isnt it typical  The game I wasnt able to get to is the one they won.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dublin Castle has a fewVaradkar meets with Belfast businesses over BrexitDuring the debate, Mr Cambpell strongly defended the DUPs confidence-and-supply deal with the Tories.He said there were \"a billion reasons\" to be proud of it and it had benefited everyone in Northern Ireland.There was standing room only at the event in St Marys College with two overflow rooms and people trying to listen to the debate in the grounds outside.Mr Varakdar said that a border poll following a hard Brexit would not be \"the right way forward\".It would take place at a very chaotic period when the Republic was still sorting out its future relationship with the UK.There may well not be a ing Assembly or Executive at Stormont, nor prior discussion about what Irish unity means. The Taoiseach said it was important that the six counties were not just absorbed into the  counties - as East Germany was into West Germany - \"it would have to be a new state\".He said a border poll in such \"chaotic\" circumstances would be isive, with voting following sectarian and religious lines.There was also a danger it would be defeated, which would be \"a real shame\" for those who believe in Irish unity. Evenit won by -%, it would be nowhere near the % endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement.Mr Varadkar said he did not want what happened after partition repeated in reverse, with the unionists being alienated from the state.Ms McDonald strongly supported a border poll. \"Brexit has demonstrated that partition is a disaster,\" she said. The constitutional question was on the table whether \"people choose to bury their heads in the sand or not\".Mrs Long said the likelihood of a border poll was increasing with the chances of a hard Brexit. But she didnt support one in those circumstances.\"What we need is order, what we need is certainty,\" she added.When askedthe DUP trusted Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the backstop, Mr Campbell said: \"Its not a matter of trust. I dont have to trust Boris and Boris doesnt have to trust us.\"What we do have to do is business with each other, and that business has brought benefit to everyone.\"He said those who \"sit and lambast\" the confidence-and-supply deal hadnt delivered anything for anyone in Northern Ireland.He also said whether the Taoiseach or Sinn Fein president liked it or not, his British identity wasnt up for negotiation.Mr McCrossan said the Prime Minister was \"full of bluff and bluster\" and he expressed concern about his \"reckless approach\". He branded the Cabinet \"extreme Brexit lunatics\".Ms McDonald said the British were \"very wrongly pointing the finger\" at the Taoiseach for the current Brexit morass when the blame lay with the Tories.Mr Beattie said that, as a Remainer, he accepted the referendum result. He could not entertain a backstop \"in any shape or form\" which would override the Union.He argued that it should be scrapped or amended. \"Is the backstop worth a no-deal Brexit \" he asked. \"Boris is bullish, trust me. I dont trust him but he is bullish. We have to come up with common ground and meet in the middle.\"Mr Beattie said it was too easy to look for a scapegoat and blame Mr Johnson, Nigel Farage, the Taoiseach or Michel Barnier. He called for ato the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement to resolve the paralysis."},{"url":null,"title":"nowrongpath people share their success stories on scottish results day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"national hunger strike commemoration take place strabane sunday","story":"This Sunday, August , for the first time the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will be held for the first time in Strabane.Thirty-eight years after ten republicans died in Long Kesh during the spring and summer of , thousands of people from across Ireland will march from Lford across the border to the west Tyrone town to remember the prison battle conducted against the Thatcher administration’s policy of criminalisation.Speaking at the announcement that Strabane will host the event, Sinn Fein’s West Tyrone MP Orfhlaith Begley said it was a privilege for Strabane republicans and the rest of the constituency to host the event.“The  hunger strike was a watershed in Irish history and had a profound impact in terms of radicalising communities throughout Ireland. This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"waterfoot park residents take council task proposed construction development","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Councilhas pledged to engage fully with a group of residents in the Waterside after they accused the local authority of failing to fulfil their obligations in relation to their objections to a potential building development in their district.In July last year, residents of Waterfoot Park in the city lodged a formal objection to plans for a housing development in the area seeking to construct four semi-detached houses, two detached houses and six, two-bedroomed apartments.The Waterfoot Park residents objected to the proposed development on several grounds which included the potential impact of the construction project on existing properties at the site and that the planning application had not indicated accurate separation and height dferences between the proposed new project and the existing homes.A statement from the Waterfoot Park Residents Objectors Committee to the Derry News said: “The proposed dwellings are three stories in height on ground over two metres higher than the existing houses with restricted separation distances between both.“The layout would result in loss of privacy, natural light, sunlight and overbearing dominance, creating a sense of being hemmed in for us existing residents living adjacent to the boundary line.“Our concerns are also for the natural habitat of wildle species and the overall vast vegetation and trees. No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister s powys visit","story":"Prime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson and Chris Davies talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson, Iain Burgessand Chris Davies..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengte by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson meeting members of staff..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score. Ably assisted by Freddie OrsquoConnor, the pair hauled the St Paulrsquos lead in until it was all square by the th minute.They again caught St Paulrsquos out and OrsquoConnor scored the winning point in the st minute.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Ryan Loughran, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Michael Collins , Gerard Walls, Patrick Eastwood, Martin Cox , Seaacuten Tucker , Daniel Eastwood, Barry Kilkey , Conor McAnespie .

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed.

Mr Wilson said that Mr Johnson should tell the taoiseach: “No, no, no.”Mr Varadkar made clear that Ireland is not prepared to renegotiate the backstop – the insurance policy which it insists is crucial to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland but which unionists have overwhelmingly opposed because it would erect barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.When askedno-deal was now the most likely outcome, Mr Varadkar said: “I think that as time goes on, it becomes more likely. I’m not sure at what point you say it becomes more than % likely or not – and I’m not sure what that necessarily achieves anyway because we’ve always been preparing for the possibility of no-deal, and been doing that for years now. “But I’m certain it can be avoided.”Mr Varadkar set out three means by which no-deal could be avoided: MPs ratying an agreement with the EU, an extension to again delay Brexit “which is an optionit is put forward for a good reason” or “ parliament and the government were to decide to – and it would have to be their decision it’s not my decision – to revoke article ”.He insisted that “ no-deal happens on October , it will be as a consequence of decision made in London, not one made in Brussels or Dublin”.The taoiseach said that he “would be very keen to over the course of the next few weeks to actually sit down with Prime Minister Johnson and talk through with him how we got to this point because I think there’s a bit of an effort now to make out that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, was an invention of the Dublin government or imposed by the European Union. That’s not the case.”He added: “What I’d like to do is talk through how we got to that point. Our analysis is dferent – we ended up with the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstopbecause of all the red lines that were drawn up by the British government. “Nowwe’re going back to square one and those red lines are being changed, then we’ve something to talk about.”Leo Varadkar: Stormont needs to be restored to give Northern Ireland a Brexit voice Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Theresa May’s key red lines were that the UK would leave the single market, would leave the customs union, would end free movement and would bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain.However, playing down any hopes of even such a substantial sht by Mr Johnson leading to a sudden deal which would see the UK leave at the end of October, he said: “It’s very dficult to see how you could conclude a dferent agreement between now and October  when the last one took two years to negotiate.”Pressed on whether, even in the event of Mr Johnson changing the UK’s red lines there could be a deal by October , he said: “I think it becomes extremely dficult. But again, October st is a deadline that was agreed between the EU and the UK. “The European Union is saying thatthere’s a good reason we can do a further extension.”When askedhe knew what would happen at the Irish border on November the UK was to leave without a deal, Mr Varadkar said: “Well, I suppose that’s still something that we’re still trying to work out in our discussions with the European Commission.“What will certainly happen is thatthe UK leaves without a deal and reverts to the WTO rules, then yes, we will have to impose WTO rules ... that does involve tarfs on imports, both north-south and also east-west and it does involve businesses having to file customs forms and tax forms and so on.“And we’ll have to have some form of checks somewhere. Obviously we don’t want to have them on the border and our preference would be to have them at the ports of entry, at business level and random checks too.”When askedbusinesses could at least have certainty that any checks will not be able to be imposed immediately and therefore trade will not halt on November , Mr Varadkar did not directly answer the question.Pressed on when those checks would begin, he said: “If the UK decides to leave without a deal and reverts to WTO rules and leaves without a deal, it would happen immediately – that’s my understanding of the legal position anyway, and it’s not something that we want it’s something that we want to avoid.“Butthat’s the decision that’s made ... you’d have the tarf barriers, which is cost, and you’d have all the other non-tarf barriers to trade as they call them – having to fill in all the forms, having to pre-declare and so on.”He said that even a no-deal Brexit or a withdrawal agreement without the backstop would not bring certainty for businesses because it would be “just kicking the fundamental questions about the Irish border and about trade between the UK and Ireland into the implementation phase or the transition phase ... so you end up with another two or three years of business uncertainty and that’s not a desirable outcome”.Responding to the argument often made by many Brexiteers and unionists thatthe UK and Ireland agreed not to erect a hard border then that can be avoided, Mr Varadkar alluded to his country’s willingness to ensure that border checks take place, saying that “from our side we would have to uphold the integrity of the single market and the customs union”.He also said that “the idea that the UK could withdraw from the European Union, join the WTO and then the first thing the UK would do would be to break the WTO rules – it’s not a basis for a future trade policy or free trade agreements with anybody, really.”try catch  TrendingN.I.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.
