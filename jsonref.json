Epstein has pleaded not guilty.         He is also believed to have used the helicopter to fly to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where he parked his notorious private jet (above). The aircraft, which has been dubbed \u0027the Lolita Express\u0027, was allegedly used to shuttle underage girls to his homes in the US Virgin Islands Palm Beach, Florida and New MexicoWednesday’s hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan.Epstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on the reports after the hearing.The charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005.They followed Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice Department’s agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges.Epstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is now widely considered too lenient.His lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing the current case over the same conduct.Weinberg said at Wednesday’s hearing that they intended to file motions on the issue.U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar. Jeffrey Epstein selling creepy helicopter built for cuddling"},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands Hong Kong pro democracy activists surgical masks blockade shopping precinct","story":"Share this article Thousands of pro-government supporters also held a rally in a separate park on Saturday, many waving Chinese flags and chanting slogans in support of the police - who have refuted allegations of using excessive force.Beijing has increasingly pitched the anti-government protests as funded by the west.In a column published on Newsweek\u0027s website on Saturday, Beijing\u0027s ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said \u0027ill intentioned\u0027 forces inside Hong Kong and overseas were trying to turn the city \u0027into a bridgehead to attack the mainland\u0027s system and spark chaos across China.\u0027China has provided little evidence beyond supportive statements from some western politicians and critics say Beijing\u0027s accusations of foreign meddling ignore Hong Kongers\u0027 legitimate grievances.

And giant, oinking Percy Pigs.At a freshly revamped store in Hempstead Valley, Kent, the retailers’s new food boss says “even more fun” will be just as important as better food ranges – hence the larger-than-life version of its best-selling novelty sweet in the food aisles.Stuart Machin says M\u0026ampS is trying to make headway in the ultra-tight grocery market by loosening up and drawing in more family shoppers. As well as the giant Percy there is a plastic chicken that clucks at the press of a button and a neon sign urging shoppers to “use your loaf”.“We take our food seriously but we don’t take ourselves too seriously,” he says.The company is also trying out larger stores where M\u0026ampS’s full range of more than 6,000 products will be available, with Hempstead one of the first. At present the group has only a dozen sites where all of those items are on offer. Most stock about 2,000 items, which pales besides the 25,000 items per store that major supermarkets offer at typical sites.Family appeal will be an important part of M\u0026ampS’s attempt to sell food online through a £750m joint venture with delivery specialist Ocado, which will kick off in September 2020.At Hempstead Valley, M\u0026ampS is pushing its food range by reducing clothing space to double the size of its food hall to nearly 1,580 sq m (17,000 sq ft). It is widening aisles so trollies can be used more easily and adding more fresh produce and fresh bakery goods, as well as additional basics from washing-up liquid to frozen vegetables and even some popular brands including Halo Top ice-cream.“We want to be more than just special occasions and a fresh ready meal. Where we have stores which are bigger they actually perform well, there are just too few of them,” Machin says.The aim is to have a store “with the mind of a supermarket and the soul of a fresh market”, he adds.At least two additional larger food stores will open before Christmas and some new food sites could be as big as 2,350 sq m. The company is planning a net 50 new standalone food stores over the next three-to-five years, although not all of these will be larger outlets. M\u0026ampS has more than 1,000 food stores, of which 300 are in full-range sites that also sell clothing.Machin, a veteran of Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda and Coles in Australia who joined M\u0026ampS in April 2018 in the newly created role of food managing director, was tasked with reinventing M\u0026ampS’s food business. The company’s chairman, Archie Norman, said the chain was losing ground to competitors because it was too slow to innovate, too expensive and weighed down by excessive waste.In the past year, M\u0026ampS has cut back short-term promotions but reduced prices on more than 400 of the most popular lines such as beef mince and bread. A basic loaf of bread is now 75p, down from £1.15, for instance, while a 300g block of Cornish Cove mature cheddar that was £3.85 is now £3 and cherry tomatoes that were £1.00 are now 65p. Concerted effort is being made to modernise an ageing supply chain to reduce waste and speed up bringing in new food ranges.But can these tweaks really make a difference in persuading families to switch from major supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s or Tesco? Machin says the chain is already several percentage points cheaper than Waitrose, currently the UK’s eighth largest grocer, and has better quality food than its bigger rivals and more focus on the ethical credentials of its suppliers.Having worked in Hempstead Valley’s Sainsbury’s as a schoolboy and returned to manage the store in his 20s as a graduate trainee, Machin is well aware the M\u0026ampS is surrounded by competitors there, including a large Tesco, a Lidl, an Aldi, a Sainsbury’s and a Morrisons.In its second week of operation, the revamped store has brought in new shoppers and persuaded them to fill trollies rather than baskets. Machin says there are “green shoots” across the chain as it is increasing the amount of goods sold.Bryan Roberts, global insights director at research firm TCC Global, says: “No matter what you throw and M\u0026ampS or Waitrose it doesn’t make you bullet proof to the advances of Aldi and Lidl and the on-going discount threat.” He said M\u0026ampS’s proud history of innovation and even its reputation for luxury food has been diluted as rivals have caught up. “There is no shortage of places to go for quality convenience foods,” Roberts says.He says the larger stores could work in selected locations but M\u0026ampS might find it difficult to find enough sites with car parks and sufficient space to make a major difference. M\u0026ampS is trying to smile, but how long can it keep it up?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96bcc0bf1736c85bf940d8a93c53da7692913af4/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16d02c303f87ef4dfec3ee402c4b4c1","title":"nervous power network groups look beyond uk renationalisation","story":"Energy suppliers may be on the frontline of the battle to win public trust in the industry, but it is the companies behind the gas pipes and electricity wires which have emerged as the easiest political targets.The network operators, including National Grid and UK Power Networks, are facing a fierce political skirmish. The industry regulator has already cut the returns they are allowed to make to all-time lows. An even greater risk looms beyond the next general election, now that Labour has pledged to bring the companies back under public control.Critics of the firms argue that the crackdown is an inevitable consequence of the years they have spent “inflating” household energy bills while siphoning off billions in idends for their international investment-fund owners. They are held up, alongside water companies and rail operators, as evidence of Britain’s failed experiment with privatisation.John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, has warned that there are deepening concerns over the UK’s political landscape, particularly among the company’s international investors. “When I talk to our investors overseas, what is important to them is a stable regulatory and political environment. The debate on state ownership has them increasingly concerned,” he said.Pettigrew joined National Grid as a graduate in 1990, just weeks after privatisation. Almost 30 years later, the free-market holy grail is tarnished by a deep mistrust of private investors and rip-off capitalism.Today, Pettigrew is steering one of Britain’s most high-profile examples of liberalisation away from the UK and towards the United States.The FTSE 100 company undertakes the same work it carries out in the UK across 9,000 miles of US electricity transmission cables in five north-eastern states. The US is a market which generates more revenue for the company than the UK, with less political risk, and stands to attract most of its future investment too.Pettigrew said earlier this year that National Grid planned to increase its investment in its frontier market from $3.5bn (£2.9bn) in the 2018-19 financial year to $5bn. It already employs more than double the number of employees in the States than it does in the UK, and it expects the business to grow beyond gas pipes and electricity lines too.Earlier this year, National Grid tied up a $100m deal to acquire US renewables company Geronimo through National Grid Ventures, its new venture-capital fund based in Silicon Valley. The innovation arm now owns a string of wind and solar farms and plans to fund new tech startups in the US with an initial investment of $250m over the next two years.The American market offers a safe haven for National Grid’s investments that lie beyond political upheaval. But it is also a market in which Pettigrew can expect stronger growth, and support from state officials to upgrade the grid and add electric-vehicle charge points.One senior industry boss, who asked not to be named, said major international investors were looking elsewhere too. “Investors are looking at the UK right now and asking whether it is the right time to be investing in any kind of regulated utility in the UK,” he said. “Investors consider two things: the opportunity and the environment. The UK’s decision to create a net-zero-carbon economy is a colossal opportunity, but the environment has given investors pause for thought.”Even those investors who believe a Labour government may pay a fair price for their assets in the event of renationalisation are concerned about draconian regulation and the threat of a no-deal Brexit: “The problem is that the need for investment in the energy industry is now.”The UK government’s strong support for building offshore wind turbines and electric vehicles will still need investment in the pylons, substations and powerlines which connect renewable energy to homes and charge points, industry sources say. The need to wean households off fossil fuels for home heating could require even more ambitious work to overhaul the country’s gas grids too.“The most critical thing about net zero carbon is about the speed of delivery – the last thing anybody should be thinking about doing is slowing this industry down,” the energy boss warned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

We don’t know her name, but this unassuming star has been watched by millions, decades after stopping to talk to a reporter on a London street. She trounced all the social media competition, including Kylie Minogue performing Do The Locomotion on a miniature railway in Scarborough.The clip was filmed for a 1977 BBC Two series of 28 programmes marking the Queen’s silver jubilee. It was intended for a show called Thanks for the Memory, then billed as the BBC’s biggest vox pop to date, that would ask citizens, “from crofters to judges”, for their views on TV of the previous 25 years. Tweeted by the BBC Archive last week for a contemporary audience, there was one standout star.In her headscarf and raincoat, she resembles the social stereotypes that Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie lampooned in the vox pop sections of their sketch show. But those characters held reactionary views, couldn’t stop looking down the lens and offered non sequiturs such as: “They’ve got hotter pavements, I know that.” However, this woman was a natural communicator, displaying a witty, easy eloquence. What she delivered was more of a social and historical soliloquy that included asides about “highbrow” plays and bad acting. If you haven’t seen it, just watch. A star is born, albeit 42 years after the event. Today, she’d be signed up for Gogglebox.It’s remarkable because no one did this well in a vox pop before. Used as a device to democratise news, their use is on the rise, especially in broadcast news. But the BBC in particular has received complaints that it has used them to propagate false balance over Brexit and they can be something of an unsuccessful TV trope.A University of Antwerp study asked what reporters make of the vox pop and concluded that most of us dislike them. As a vox veteran, I can confirm that trudging along a high street in February, waving a fluffy mic and begging people to stop and give you a soundbite as the light fades is challenging.Every reporter has stories. My favourite is when I jumped out from behind a pillar box to ask an elderly couple: “What’s your favourite scary movie?” “My dear,” one replied witheringly, “we are Islington intellectuals, we don’t watch scary movies.” But this one, well it works and is probably the only example endorsed by the vox populi.The writer Jia Tolentino is exceptionally good at decoding these febrile times. She has been described as the new Joan Didion and in a period when the centre doesn’t feel to be holding at all well, her new collection of essays, Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion, offers a welcome intervention.However, don’t expect go-get-’em affirmations and tips on optimising your time à la Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In. Tolentino’s central conceit is that women “are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy” and the “hard labour of self-optimisation” is part of that.So, while you might imagine you’re doing great work on your abs and socking it to The Man by visiting boutique exercise studios and becoming physically strong, she reveals you to be a patsy in expensive sportswear. Nobody said this was going to be easy.If, like me, you have succumbed to a barre-based exercise system at a boutique gym, it’s time to face your “pragmatic self-delusion”. The original barre system, based on the strength and flexibility training that dancers endure, was devised by the late Lotte Berk. But barre-based exercise has recently experienced a surge in popularity, partly due to its perceived effectiveness classes are described by Tolentino as “a manic and ritualised activity”.Classes are certainly not for the fainthearted. Then there’s the accessories – mesh-panelled leggings and kale smoothies – all of which bump up the cost while simultaneously exposing you as an agent of late-stage capitalism. As a precaution, I’m taking the rest of the summer off.Best of luck to Renée E Tirado, who joins luxury fashion house Gucci as the brand’s first ever head of ersity, equity and inclusion.She joins fashion from baseball, which I’m sure has its own complexities, but at least there aren’t design teams immortalising their prejudice by turning it into a luxury good and offering it up on a plinth in a major retail space.The recent output of some of the world’s biggest brands includes Gucci’s own $890 (£689) balaclava jumper, which was accused of transposing blackface to knitwear (naturally, it was released during Black History Month in the US) and Prada’s $550 handbag keychain, described as “Sambo-esque” by critics. Most recently, Gucci sent a $790 turban down the runway on a white model.Objectively, it’s hard to comprehend how these items went into production, never mind into shops. This isn’t just one lone designer and a secret sketchpad. Entire committees review designs to make sure they are on trend enough, samples get made and checked, press teams decide how to message new launches. But no one noticed?Tirado’s appointment is welcome, but there’s definitely work to be done.• Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5504e3bea30182bf924b8f3c6aa5e63405672cc7/0_21_2441_1464/master/2441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb684065a1ae59b04312365e8eb7af37","title":"behind tory claims of bold brexit action is nothing but empty bravado","story":"Like an enraged bull charging a matador, the British right is putting its head down and stampeding towards a no-deal Brexit. It has to keep moving. Were it to stop and consider where it was heading, it would never take the risks it is taking with Britain’s future.The left fails so often because it thinks it is enough to hate Conservatives and say they are wicked, rather than understand Conservatives and show them to be dangerous. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that on its own terms the right ought to know that a no-deal Brexit is an act of epic folly and that Boris Johnson’s talk of a new golden age for merrie England is as much bullshit as bullish: the drivel of a man and a movement that have nothing but empty bravado to sustain them.If Tories meant what they said, they would not govern as they do. They believe that the civil service has failed the country. Yet they assure the public that same civil service can complete the most complicated operation Britain has attempted since D-Day. They believe that markets possess more knowledge than the state. Yet they ignore the warnings from the currency markets that Brexit could push us into a sterling crisis. They deride the conformism of millennial snowflakes and the mindlessness of the Corbyn cult. Yet they are the upholders of an ideology in which reasonable doubt has become as heretical as denying the inity of Christ.Like Jordan Peterson or Noam Chomsky, Dominic Cummings specialises in sweeping assertions that fall apart when you ask that simplest of questions: “So what should we do?” You won’t find coherent answers in the series of polemics he wrote before he joined Johnson in Downing Street. Thinkers in the Cummings style are performers who play to their audiences’ prejudices. They cover the play-acting with a cloak of learned references so their listeners can pretend they are hearing something more substantial than pub talk.Cummings appeals to two Conservative prejudices: EU membership cripples Britain and the state bureaucracy is filled with incompetent time-servers. “Duff people are promoted to the most senior roles and the thousands of able people leave,” Cummings says of Whitehall. Although many find it possible to damn Brussels in one breath and the public sector in the next – indeed, if you add the damning of immigration, you have the sum of what passes for conversation in Tory circles – it is impossible for a serious man or woman to hold both beliefs simultaneously.Brexit must lead to an explosion of investment in and reliance on the Whitehall bureaucrats the right despises as time-wasters. The Institute of Government reports that at least 16,000 officials will be working on Brexit by the autumn and numbers are likely to rise after no deal. Whitehall will have to impose direct rule on Northern Ireland as the dilettantes of the right unravel the Irish peace process. A long-term shift towards corporatism seems to me to be inevitable. The answer to the question: “So what should we do?” can only be to increase the power of the state to help struggling businesses, manage the tensions in the union and strike a trade deal with the EU that will be far harder to negotiate once we are pleading for help from the outside.As it is, Tories who once said there was no magic money tree behave as if they have discovered an enchanted forest where notes flutter down to the state’s coffers like autumn leaves. For propaganda purposes, they are conning the country that the hundreds of millions they are spending on no-deal preparations are an emergency measure. They pretend Brexit is like a freak storm. If we are prepared, we can “get through it” and then stride on to the bright Johnsonian uplands. It’s not just that Conservatives and Faragists don’t tell the public Brexit will trap Britain in a rolling crisis that will continue well into the 2020s – and that the harder the Brexit is the deeper the crisis will be. It’s that, as the chair of the public accounts committee said, the spending splurge is all for show. There is not the time to recruit and train staff if the British bull is to crash into the Halloween deadline.The pieces Cummings wrote between working for Michael Gove, running the Vote Leave campaign and going to Downing Street are peppered with references to every authority from Homer to Einstein. The displays of erudition conceal the contradictions in his thought. For Cummings, science and markets have mechanisms that governments lack, “to build reliable knowledge”. You cannot respect his intellectual integrity when he and the wider right have nothing to say to the overwhelming majority of British scientists who think Brexit is a national disaster and take no notice of the panicking markets.Cummings took TS Eliot’s poem The Hollow Men as the title for his musings on the failures of Westminster and Whitehall. “We are the hollow men. We are the stuffed men. Leaning together. Headpiece filled with straw.”Eliot closes with: “This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but with a whimper.” How apposite. The failure of the right to be honest with itself, and live by its own rules, will leave the British whimpering for as far ahead as anyone can see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7a83db0d1e20bd32d85dba7735c5f95f25982e/0_129_1877_1126/master/1877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d64a2d97f8c53bd355d779f7de25677e","title":"easy to mock eco celebs better to give them benefit of doubt","story":"It’s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age – how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions?The world has been agog at Camp Google, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Bono, Chris Martin and more – too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting Prince Harry, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment – barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry’s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: “Uh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.”Presumably the £16.5m eco-knees-up was at least partly enabled by Google’s ongoing tax avoidance, but let’s not spoil a beautiful moment with facts and stuff. A total of 114 private jets ferried the celebrities to Italy, releasing hundreds of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. As they arrived in Sicily, they transferred to Camp Google in luxury vehicles andor helicopters.There followed what must surely have been intellectually invigorating A-list debates about how “we” (they mean us, not them) must conserve the Earth’s resources. After that, the celebrity activists retired to relax in their gratis £730-a-night-plus rooms, perchance haunted by the spectres of global eco-catastrophe and Coldplay agreeing to perform. Perhaps, like me, you’re thinking: “If only self-awareness could be solar-powered”? I mean, did anyone at Google realise how all this starry eco-activism might look to the outside world? The tiny disconnect between what Google and its guests were saying and what they were doing? Apparently not.However, and this is a serious question: how do people expect eco-celebs to get around? When they lend support, as Emma Thompson did for the recent Extinction Rebellion rally in London, they risk being roasted under the hot sun of public and media condemnation. Is this fair – presumably the publicity a celebrity generates justifies the carbon? Should the famous stick to local events and videolinks or just not bother? It’s not as if Harry could have micro-scooted to Sicily or descended in a hot-air balloon, like a woke, royal Phileas Fogg.Not that this excuses the gargantuan excess and repellent insincerity of Camp Google. (Note to Silicon Valley: if you want to throw grotesquely smug A-list beanos, spare us the ghastly faux-worthiness.)However, it’s worth asking if mocking the motivations-cum-emissions of eco-celebs is fast turning into a socially acceptable bloodsport. While A-list hypocrisy is always great fun, our own isn’t entirely without its amusements.British women with hideous, unsightly vaginas, rejoice – help is at hand! New York company VSPOT plans to open a “vaginal spa” in London’s Knightsbridge this autumn. Treatments could include vaginal steaming (I’ve always presumed this must be akin to crouching knickerless over a steaming kettle, but even better) “V-tightening” with a laser (a fun day out for all the family) and a mysterious herb-infused vagina “facial”. They do realise this isn’t where a lady’s face is, right?This is serious. Like labial surgery, popularised by pornography, it sends out the message that female genitals are unacceptable left alone and need to be prettified. That something very wrong is going on “down there” and should be fretted about and attended to. Never mind that medical people point out that the vagina is self-cleaning and doesn’t require such treatments. Also, that steaming might not only burn the vaginal walls, but alter the heathy balance of bacteria, leading to infections. Astonishing, isn’t it? Who’d have thought that going boil-in-the-bag with genitals would be a bad idea? Trust qualified gynaecologists to ruin a relaxing spa day.Another major alarm bell is that Gwyneth Paltrow appears to have no involvement in this company. Wasn’t Paltrow one of the intrepid pioneers of steaming vaginas? Didn’t she also champion inserting jade eggs until, again, some spoilsport gynaecologists said something about toxic shock syndrome and bacterial vaginosis?Sorry, but I can’t take anything in the arena of vagina maintenance seriously unless Gwynnie’s face is attached. She is our queen of down-below quackery and female genitalia spruce-ups. She should be alerted that someone is trying to steal her vaginal thunder. In the meantime, I’ll continue to feel thrilled that women are being encouraged to worry about the actual insides of their bodies. Next week: women, are you satisfied with the shape of your kidneys?Not to get all “judgey” on iron age women, but at least one was a lazy, sweet-munching fashion victim, say Swiss archaeologists. They discovered a hollowed-out, tree-trunk coffin in the Aussersihl district in Zurich bearing the body of a well-to-do Celtic woman, wearing fine clothes and jewellery, with indications that she had a sweet tooth and did little physical work.Could this be an ancestor of mine? There are eerie similarities, if you take away the upper-class bling, replace sweet with savoury and add “evidence” of entire weekends sprawled on the sofa watching boxsets of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, with no movement visible to the naked eye.How did they get all this information from a 2,200-year-old corpse? And surely she could not have imagined that, in a couple of millennia, the world would be raising a censorious eyebrow over her amber necklaces and sweet-toothed indolence.Perhaps the trend will catch on and henceforth people will be buried judgmentally with their consumer detritus – mobile phones, KFC buckets and Amazon vouchers. “It’s what she would have wanted – I mean, seriously, she really did want that Accessorize bracelet.” Modern people are criticised for sedentary, over-indulgent lifestyles, but it would appear we are merely following tradition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bae04496419e2a296b512e8de8d55b92e921cbd/0_54_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4db3338012e6d026643893b1075291db","title":"the ogre of no deal brexit cartoon","story":"As the Tory majority is cut to one, the prospect of crashing out of the EU looms large• You can buy your own print of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e881a855aa340d25a1e6f3d32072cb60","title":"only in canada weird and wonderful experiences countrywide","story":"Want to track down the mythical Ogopogo, ice-skate on the Atlantic Ocean or get your hands on a polar bear-shaped number plate?

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg. They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender. We have to wonder what Homer Simpson would order!Want a polar bear-shaped number plate? You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest. Travellers have been bringing signposts from their hometowns since 1942 and you can carry on that tradition with one of your own.Ogopogo is a mythical monster similar to the Loch Ness monster that supposedly lives in Lake Okanagan, British ColumbiaDo you believe in folklore and mystery? Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the Caravan Farm Theatre under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it’s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba ing at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster.Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address?

At Canada Post, they have set up a system to ensure that every child who writes from home gets a personal response from Saint Nick. The postal service received a record-breaking 1.6m letters in 2017, so if you’ve ever wanted your own letter from the big guy in red, now’s your chance!Ever dreamed of spotting beluga whales? Get yourself to Churchill, ManitobaIf there is one thing you need to know, it’s that Churchill, Manitoba, is known for its abundance of Canadian wildlife. Many belugas migrate through Hudson Bay in the months of July and August, when tens of thousands pass through the area. Thanks to Sea North Tours, you’ll be able to have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear belugas singing through hydrophones – you can listen to their whistles and squeals while observing their majestic beauty from boats that have no moving parts that can harm the whales.The province where Anne of Green Gables was set, Prince Edward Island is just 140 miles long and 35 miles wideFun fact: as one of Canada’s three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is the smallest. Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins.

This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going.

Above the drone of planes bringing travellers into Gatwick, the walkers – variously devotees of trekking, folk music or wildlife – raise their voices to sing an old English folk song that is told from the point of view of a globetrotting visitor to these shores: “Fare you well, my dear, I must be gone  And leave you for a while  If I roam away, I’ll come back again  Though I roam 10,000 miles, my dear  Though I roam 10,000 miles.”The song, The Turtle Dove, was discovered by Ralph Vaughan Williams when the Plough’s publican sang it to him more than 100 years ago. It is a forgotten lament for a bird that has inspired writers, musicians and country-dwellers for centuries. This small, delicate wild dove, with grey feathers blushed pink and ginger, is a symbol of renewal in the Old Testament and an emblem of love and constancy for Shakespeare. The romance embodied by the turtle dove has fluttered into countless songs, from The Twelve Days of Christmas to Elvis Presley’s Baby If You’ll Give Me All Your Love and Cliff Richard’s Bachelor Boy. But this celebrated bird is slipping towards extinction in Britain.The pilgrims, led by the singer Sam Lee, are beginning a two-day walk from the Plough to one of the turtle dove’s last strongholds, the Knepp estate in West Sussex. In a quixotic act of faith, they plan to sing the song to the doves. If we all paid more attention to this enigmatic bird, thinks Lee, perhaps we could save it from disappearing.“We’re casting a magical spell,” says Lee. “Vaughan Williams was passing this pub on his bicycle 113 years ago and he popped in and said: ‘Anyone know any songs?’ The landlord sang him The Turtle Dove, which he’d never heard before. He took it away to London and he made a global hit.” Vaughan Williams’ arrangement of the song has been recorded, in different forms and with different titles, by artists including Joan Baez, Marianne Faithfull and Nic Jones, yet the song’s original meaning has been forgotten, explains Lee, especially in its Sussex heartland. “We’re going to rewild this song,” he says. “The amazing connection is that the song itself is about extinction.” The turtle dove sings of its migration, its disappearance and its devotion to its unnamed love, which could be for a place as well as a person.The turtle dove is a symbol of the extinction crisis unfolding in Britain. Our intensively farmed, densely populated country can still look pretty, but experts agree that lowland Britain – the turtle dove’s home – is one of the most nature-depleted landscapes in the world. More than half of Britain’s plant and animal species are in decline and one in 10 is severely threatened. More than 40 million birds have vanished from this country in 50 years.The Victorians may have seen flocks of turtle doves, but today they are elusive the best chance of encountering one is to hear a calling male, which makes the soft “tur-turr” that gives the dove its name. The sound is gentle, summery and somnolent – one of the most soothing in nature, according to Victorian admirers. When I search for it this summer, I hear it only beside the old walled courtyard at Pensthorpe, a Norfolk nature reserve that has run a trial to breed the doves in captivity. “It’s so sad that the only place to hear them is in our aviary,” says Chrissie Kelley, head of species management at Pensthorpe Conservation Trust. “It used to be a common sound.”Kelley takes me through the turtle dove’s troubled recent history. It has been affected badly by recent droughts in Africa and the Mediterranean penchant for shooting migrating birds each spring and autumn (traditionally for food, but now more for fun). It has been estimated that 3 million turtle doves are shot each year. While EU law bans the hunting of birds during periods of breeding and migration, the turtle dove is still shot in many countries during autumn. In addition, BirdLife International estimates that 600,000 are killed illegally each year.But these trends do not explain entirely the loss of British turtle doves. Although the bird is declining across Europe (down more than a third this century), only in the similarly intensively farmed Netherlands is there a decline to match Britain’s. Turtle doves eat mostly grains, living on wild plant and weed seeds. Since the 50s, Britain has destroyed almost all its wildflower meadows, while chemical pesticides have removed arable weeds. “Back in the day, when turtle doves were very numerous, they’d feed on farmers’ grain spills,” says Kelley. “Fifty years ago there was a lot more mess – stubble fields and open barns. We’ve got so clean in our farming practices now, that there’s no spillage, no waste.”Britain has also lost dense hedgerows where the turtle dove likes to nest. “They need thick, scrubby hedgerows, because as far as turtle doves are concerned they think a couple of twigs is a nest,” says Kelley, pointing out the feeble construction her captive doves have made in a thicket inside the aviary. “They need food and water fairly close by, sucking up water to make crop milk for their young.”Pensthorpe is working with a group of mid-Norfolk farmers to preserve hedgerows, restore farm ponds and offer the birds supplementary food. It is a formula being repeated across the turtle dove’s last strongholds in the south-east and Yorkshire, as part of Operation Turtle Dove, a partnership by charities including the RSPB and Natural England, the government’s advisory body on the environment. But earlier, similar, schemes have not worked. One Norfolk farmer who planted field margins with wild seed mixes succeeded in boosting bird populations, but not turtle doves.Isabella Tree, the co-owner of the Knepp estate, is critical of recent attempts to provide the doves with additional food. Knepp is one of the few places where turtle doves are increasing: from none at the start of the century, the 1,400-hectare (3,500-acre) farm now has 20 calling males. In the book Wilding, Tree’s account of how she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, returned their farm to nature over two decades, she argues that our categorisation of the turtle dove as a “farmland” bird is misleading. What did it eat before there were farms? What does it eat in sub-Saharan Africa? Tree believes turtle doves that have been observed eating spilled arable grains in Britain are starving and desperate. Any dove breeder will tell you about the dangers of feeding wheat and corn to the birds: cracked grain can tear the throat, while in the gut it absorbs moisture and can cause fungal diseases.When Operation Turtle Dove launched in 2012, the RSPB wanted to scatter a mix of wheat, oilseed rape, millet and canary seed at sites including Knepp. Tree and Burrell politely refused. Knepp’s farm produces no such seeds, yet their turtle doves are thriving. “Why can’t modern conservationists go back to the meticulous records of the Victorians to find out what turtle doves were actually eating?” asks Tree.While conservationists agree that turtle doves love weed seeds such as common fumitory (which has returned to rewilded Knepp), most weeds do not produce seeds until the middle of summer the turtle dove arrives in Britain, undernourished, in April and May. In fact, says Tree, there are old accounts of turtle doves eating snails. They may peck at hawthorn shoots, too. Ornithologists have observed continental turtle doves eating berries, fungi and invertebrates.One theory is that Knepp’s turtle doves are thriving because they can easily find seeds on the bare ground created by the rootling of the wild pigs that Tree and Burrell have restored to their farm. “We know the turtle doves like bare earth, where their little legs aren’t having to cope with anything too scraggy or long,” says Tree. “They want areas where they can see what’s coming and fly off quickly.” Turtle doves at Knepp this summer are being caught and fitted with a radio tag that should help scientists identify where they have been feeding and deduce precisely what they need.Increasingly, however, conservationists fear there are other, even more complicated causes for their demise. Carles Carboneras, an RSPB research scientist who specialises in migratory birds, says that global heating is causing quail, another migratory “farmland” bird, to move further northwards. But the turtle dove is showing no sign of expanding its range. “Everybody agrees the main cause for the decline is the transformation of landscape,” says Carboneras. “The increase in monocultures is very, very bad for the species. In this country, you either have very intense agriculture or very dense woodlands – and neither of these is good for turtle doves.”But Carboneras points out that this shift to a “simplified” landscape in Britain occurred 50 years ago. So why have turtle dove populations fallen so dramatically more recently? Carboneras fears that the rapid accumulation of nitrogen from farm fertilisers and traffic pollution in the soil is causing vegetation to grow too quickly for turtle doves. “If the grass is too high, they can’t access the food. In the south-east, we’re probably seeing the effect of nutrients, but it’s a hunch. We don’t have the evidence for that yet.”It will be difficult to save the turtle dove without understanding the reasons for its decline but, some conservationists warn, endangered species have been “studied to extinction” in the past. We cannot always afford to wait. At Pensthorpe, Kelley and her team have successfully demonstrated how to breed turtle doves in captivity. Here, turtle dove eggs are fostered by Barbary doves, because these common birds are less sensitive and happy to be kept inside smaller cages. Releasing captive-bred turtle doves into the wild, says Kelley, could be “an insurance policy for British wild birds before they go extinct”.The RSPB is opposed to breeding turtle doves in captivity, saying captive-bred birds are unlikely to possess a migratory instinct they would not depart every autumn and return each spring.“This is like the British solving their own problem – and so what? You still have a declining population internationally. You cannot have millions of captive-bred turtle doves being released across Europe and expect them to behave naturally and link breeding and wintering areas as they have done since they evolved. It might solve the problem for this island, but not for the species,” Carboneras says.Other conservation scientists disagree. Carl Jones has used captive breeding to save the pink pigeon and other critically endangered birds from extinction on Mauritius. Now, as chief scientist for Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, an international charity, he is looking at whether he can help save British turtle doves with a similarly intensive rescue plan. The RSPB is, he thinks, being “narrow-minded” and cites other examples of the successful release of captive-bred migratory birds, from the white stork across Europe to the orange-bellied parrot in Tasmania.“There’s no better way of understanding these animals than breeding them in captivity and really getting hands on with them, rather than just standing back and observing decline or putting fences around things,” says Jones. He argues that a captive-breeding programme, alongside the management of wild populations through supplementary feeding, is the best way of saving endangered species and quickly understanding their needs.Back at Knepp, the pilgrims arrive, wet and exhausted, at their journey’s end. At 4am, they rise from their bell tents and head to great green pillows of sallow and blackthorn scrub in the rewilded landscape. Here they finally hear the tur-turring of the turtle dove and softly sing Vaughan Williams’ folk song.“There’s something immensely calming about the turtle dove’s song,” says Lee. “It has this low frequency that suddenly appears and disappears. It’s almost the flicker of a film – and such a metaphor for its own situation. The silence around it is as powerful as its presence.” Singing about this bird, he says, makes it “become more powerful and significant. Suddenly the bird is fuller and you realise every creature has that potential – we’ve just stopped listening”.Most of us will never notice if this one small bird with its soft song disappears from Britain. How would we lose if it does? “There are so many ways,” says Lee. “The disappearance of its song is part of a greater silencing of the natural world. Losing the turtle dove is to lose the intelligence of that creature, which understands the landscape around it and plays a part in it.” He pauses. “It’s the burning down of a library. To take these books off the shelves and lose them would be to weaken us as human beings.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d7f1700b3c54bd2b80083658d0fbcbc6b7639f/0_208_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00eacfc1272aa41a617459e7d766538b","title":"whaley bridge residents allowed to return for 15 minutes","story":"People evacuated from town threatened by damaged dam make ‘controlled’ visits to pick up pets and other essentialsRAF pilots and emergency workers were continuing their round-the-clock efforts to shore up a stricken dam before the area is besieged by threatened thunderstorms.A Chinook helicopter made scores of forays over the Toddbrook reservoir at Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire, to drop bags of ballast into a section damaged by recent heavy downpours.Around 1,500 people have been evacuated from the lower reaches of the town. Some have been given temporary accommodation in a local school, while others were staying with friends and relatives.The evacuated residents were allowed back into their homes for short, controlled visits to pick up pets and other essentials.Derbyshire police took the decision to allow one person from each of the 400 Whaley Bridge properties evacuated on Thursday to return for a 15-minute visit on Saturday.At the Horwich End traffic lights on the Buxton side of the town, cars lined up to be let through the police blockade. Officers have attempted to stop people entering the steep-sided village from all directions since Thursday afternoon when a month and a half’s rainfall fell on the Derbyshire hills in just 48 hours, causing massive damage to the 180-year-old dam at Toddbrook reservoir.Engineers deemed there was a “substantial risk to life” should the reservoir fail, prompting the evacuation of the lower quarter of the town.Ania Hill had been worrying about her cat, Slippers, ever since the evacuation. She was relieved to find him alive but distressed. He had not gone hungry after a neighbour managed to throw him food through the letterbox. “He was quite upset, I’ve had to put him in the dark in the boot to calm him down,” she said, after her personal rescue mission.Police had stipulated that only one person per household would be allowed through the cordon. Visits were to be timed, with residents signing in and out. But in practice, many people had brought their friend or spouse and took far longer than their allotted 15 minutes, as an RAF Chinook helicopter ferried bags of aggregate above their heads to drop on the damaged dam.Gill and Martin Shaw, who live on Buxton Road, the main road through the town, took the opportunity to pop home and move more belongings upstairs – furniture and Gill’s collection of ornaments.Like many residents, they take seriously the warning from engineers who said on Friday night that they remained “very concerned” about the integrity of the structure, despite an extensive pumping operation having reduced water levels in Toddbrook reservoir by half a metre.They were also worried about looters after Martin popped back on Friday night to see two men trying to break into his shed. “It was two fellas, their trousers all wet – I think they must have entered the village via the River Goyt, which runs right behind our house,” said Martin.Derbyshire police said it would look into the claims of looting, with a press officer saying she was unaware of problems of that nature following the mass evacuation.Fred Salmon, who runs the Bike Factory shop, right in the centre of the town, arrived with his van, hoping to bundle as many bicycles in the back as he could. Another woman, rushing too much to give her name, speed-walked to her house to pick up her passport: she was off on holiday later in the day.Dan Curley, the landlord of the Cock pub on Buxton Road, was finally allowed back to fetch his spectacles, having spent the first 36 hours after the evacuation with a splitting headache.Peter Drinkwater was among those allowed back to his terraced cottage. “Until the evacuation, I’d never spent a night away from the house in 37 years,” he said after retrieving a selection of clothes and medication.His daughter, Cathryn Swann, said: “It feels really eerie down there. The police had told us to come straight back if we heard any rumbling sounds, and of course there was rumbling anyway from all the aggregate being dropped on to the dam.“I panicked a couple of times, but thankfully we’re OK.”Ruth George, the local Labour MP, who lives just outside Whaley Bridge, arrived to find out the latest news.She said she had written to Boris Johnson on Friday night after his visit to Whaley Bridge. He told local residents that he had flown over the dam and thought it was “dodgy but stable” and assured them they would all be rehoused should the worst happen.In her letter to the prime minister, George asked him to ensure a proper investigation into why the reservoir dam had been damaged and to ensure it can’t happen again. “It’s not just about the emergency situation, as important as that is,” she wrote. “Whaley Bridge as a town needs to be able to feel safe for the long term and we need to know what the options are.”She commended the emergency services but warned that the situation remained critical, with poor weather expected from Sunday. “We’re expecting lots and lots of rain over the next few days so I can quite understand the authorities not being prepared to say it’s safe until those storms have gone.”Edwina Currie, a former Conservative MP who lives in one of the higher parts of the town, said: “Our reservoir is looking like it’s in intensive care at the moment. There are pipes everywhere giving it the treatment it needs. But we are a sturdy lot up here and you won’t hear us complaining.”The environment minister Thérèse Coffey said the situation remained in a “critical stage” on Saturday as she issued a message to residents.“I cannot emphasise enough how patient they need to be,” Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Of course this is a distressing and worrying time for them, but if that dam were to breach it would lead to a loss of life if there were people there. There’s no doubt about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aee90ae8c341e16b8a2a26a7fb314d6785e4cb1d/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cca3390df75658142f6e15712711313e 1400w","title":"sequins summer fashion sustainable biodegradable recycled","story":"Sequins, like dogs, are not just for Christmas. The essential element of festive dressing has jumped season this year to put the sparkle into summer. But not everyone is happy to see plastic making a comeback just as the fashion industry is trying to become more sustainable.“I love a sparkly dress, but covering a dress in plastic cannot be justified if its worn once and discarded,” says Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns to stop plastic pollution. “It needs to be a wardrobe staple.”This summer sequins have been everywhere, from the catwalk to the TV screen. In the recent Love Island finale, two of the four female finalists opted for sequin dresses. In July actor Danielle Brooks wore a floor-length sequin dress and a sequin jacket to the season seven premiere of Orange is the New Black. The big screen is also sparkling: in the film Animals, released last month, the actor Alia Shawkat appears in an impressive sequin jumpsuit – a look mirrored by her co-star Holliday Grainger at the film’s premiere in May. Sparkles have not just dazzled on the red carpet, but have been prominent on the UK’s streets and fields with rainbow sequins a core feature of June’s LGBT Pride month and a highlight of music festivals. Online fashion retailer PrettyLittleThing’s festival edit includes sequins on dresses, halter tops and bralettes, while Asos currently stocks nearly 1,500 items which pertain to the search term “sequin”. The high street is also cashing in: at Zara, bags and dresses sparkle. On the catwalk, sequins featured in springsummer 2019 collections from Alexa Chung and Ashish. Gucci campaign star Harry Styles told Dazed last week: “Just going on stage in a nuts suit with a bunch of sequins makes you feel good, and then you want to play.”But environmentalists warn consumers not to be too dazzled by sequins, which are often made from PVC and can be used in huge numbers – sometimes more than 200,000 on one garment – until recycled and biodegradable options become more available. “I’ve had more and more interest from fashion companies keen to reduce their environmental impact,” says Rachel Clowes, founder of the Sustainable Sequin Company, which makes sequins from recycled PET and is working on biodegradable versions. “Some designers are also looking to increase the value attributed to sequins, and getting bespoke designs cut. The future can be sustainable and sparkling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a464156d43c95cad52a69c752512a4770f8846de/0_1007_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe622a9df4c0a64e9fd7d411466bd61a","title":"meera sodha exclusive vegan and vegetarian recipes new book","story":"A virtual voyage of south‑east Asia and India provided inspiration for these sides, main courses and dessertsIt’s just over two years since I got the call asking me to write a vegan recipe column for this magazine. It was a dream come true, but there were a few small problems.For a start, I wasn’t vegan.Second, I had only ever written about Indian food.Third, I had just had a baby, who was only a few weeks old. Not only had life been thrown into chaos by Arya’s arrival, but I had planned to take a year off. It was an amazing opportunity that had come at the worst possible time. I stalled for a day. I said yes.The truth is, I was excited to enter this brave new world. Huge numbers of people, growing by the day even then, were choosing to eat a more plant-based diet, whether for political, environmental or financial reasons. Although a relatively small number were vegan, a larger number were trying to reduce the meat and dairy in their diet. This seemed an important discussion and I wanted to be a part of it.At the time, many of the recipes being touted for vegans weren’t tempting. They didn’t make me hungry, anyway. Plant-based food was still in the shadows of its association with hemp-trouser-wearing hippies, or hijacked by the wellness brigade. It felt as though the pleasures of eating and the importance of flavour had been forgotten.As an outsider, I thought I could be more inventive. I understood meat-eaters and knew the textures, flavours and “richness” they might miss. I had also spent two years writing a vegetarian Indian cookery book I knew how to make bitter cavolo nero leaves sing and how to tempt a beetroot-hater into eating a plateful.I began by looking beyond India to east and south-east Asia, finding new ways to shift vegetables from the side to the centre of the table. I had already travelled to Sri Lanka and eaten sublime beetroot and cashew curries. In Thailand, I had memorised every twist in the creation of som tam salad and counted down the minutes until my next pad thai. I had been soothed by my first congee in Hong Kong and had my taste buds electrified in London’s Chinatown by a bowl of dan dan noodles. I was hungry for more.I also found that vegan constraints are a catalyst for creativity. Not cooking with meat, fish, dairy or eggs forced me to think in new ways. I discovered the wonderful world of the Asian larder: fermented, pickled and salted ingredients – kimchi, sweet miso and gochujang added flavour in an instant.But veganism wasn’t my only constraint. I had much less time on my hands, now that I was a mum. This meant that elaborate dishes, or those that required too much time to prepare or cook, were left out. They didn’t make the cut for my  column, or my new book.The biggest limitation of the past two years was not being able to travel to the countries whose food I wanted to explore, as I had for my Indian cookbooks. My daughter was so young and I didn’t want to leave her. This time, I travelled by reading: I followed Fuchsia Dunlop around the streets of Chengdu and saw 90s Jakarta through Madhur Jaffrey’s eyes. When I ran out of books, I packed Arya and a notebook into a baby carrier and went on a food safari, to find the best laksa, bun cha or massaman curry in London.I found that I could travel to Asia without travelling very far at all. I spoke to a friend, Ben, who is from Borneo, where Sarawak laksa is prized. I begged Wichet Khongphoon, the owner-chef of the Thai restaurant Supawan in central London, to show me how to make a tom kha gai soup and Shuko Oda, the Japanese chef, to teach me how to make her walnut miso. I accosted home cooks on social media who had innocently posted photos of their breakfast, to ask them more about what they ate and how they made it.I embarked on a virtual curry odyssey around India – from Punjab in the north to Mysore, the city that smells of sandalwood and yoga mats, in the south to the neighbouring state of Kerala and its mild istoos (vegetables cooked in a ginger, chilli and coconut sauce) and east to Tamil Nadu where, between ancient carved temples and silk sari shops, you will find restaurants serving thakkali kuzhambu, a tomato curry cooked with tamarind, coconut and pickling spices such as mustard, fennel and cumin seeds.I sailed across the Palk Strait to Sri Lanka, where lunch means a selection of curries each made from one main ingredient – beetroot, aubergine, pumpkin, cashew – served alongside a coconut dal (parippu). I travelled east to Thailand, and on to Japan, where the katsu curry bears little resemblance to anything I’ve eaten anywhere else.And I converted to tofu. Until a couple of years ago, I was a tofu-denier. The dish that changed my mind was chilli tofu, shared with my father at his favourite bolthole, a canteen called Tangoe in Leicester. The tofu was crisp and chewy, giving way to a soft and creamy sponginess, and doused in a sweet, fiery sauce. This is living, I remember thinking – until we got to the last piece. Surely it’s the daughter who should have it, I said, but he decided it was the father’s right. We are still on speaking terms.Here, then, are six new vegan and vegetarian recipes from my travels. I hope you enjoy.Celery and peanut wontons with chilli soy sauceWonton wrappers can be found in Chinese or large supermarkets the sauce is mainly made out of store-cupboard ingredients.Makes 24 wontons (serves 4 to 6)For the wontons160g unsalted peanuts800g celery, leaves reserved4 tbsp rapeseed oil4 cloves of garlic, crushed with 2 tbsp light soy sauce24 wonton wrappers (or egg-free gyoza wrappers, if vegan), defrostedFor the chilli soy sauce2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 tbsp toasted sesame oil4 tbsp light soy sauce2 cloves of garlic, crushed1 tsp chilli flakes1½ tbsp white wine vinegar2 spring onions, choppedFirst, make the wonton filling. Place the peanuts in a food processor and blitz. Roughly chop the celery, then place in the food processor with the peanuts. Pulse until the pieces resemble coarse mince. Heat the rapeseed oil in a pan and, when hot, add the celery and peanut mixture. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes over a medium heat, stirring frequently to remove as much water as possible, then add the garlic and soy sauce and cook for a further 5 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to one side to cool.To make the chilli soy sauce, place all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then immediately take off the heat.To fill the wontons, lay a wrapper in front of you in a diamond shape. Put 1½ tsp of filling into the centre. Brush the edges lightly with water and fold in half to form a triangle. Press down around the filling, then press outwards to seal it properly and place on a plate. Repeat.To cook the wontons, drop batches of about six into a pan of boiling water for 5 minutes at a time, then drain. To serve, ide the wontons between the plates, drizzle some sauce over each portion, then scatter over some celery leaves.Pistachio, pea and mint soba noodles50g pistachio kernels1 bird’s-eye chilli, finely chopped2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped300g frozen petit pois, defrosted25g fresh mint, leaves picked3 tbsp lime juice (from 2 limes)3½ tbsp toasted sesame oil1⅓ tsp salt200g soba noodles120g mangetout100g watercress, tough stems removed, choppedPlace the pistachios, chilli and garlic in a food processor and process until the pistachios have broken down. Add the peas, mint, lime juice, 3 tbsp of sesame oil and the salt, and pulse a few times (don’t blend: you don’t want soup).Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and, when bubbling, drop in the noodles. Stir and boil according to the instructions. Drain, refresh briefly under cold water and drain again in a sieve over a bowl. Coat with the remaining ½ tbsp of sesame oil, using your fingers, to make sure they don’t stick.Set the same saucepan over a low heat and put a couple of tablespoons of water into the pan. When hot, add the mangetout. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then add the watercress. Stir-fry for a minute until it wilts, then take the pan off the heat.Place the noodles in a mixing bowl and add the vegetables. Mix with your hands, then tip on to a plate to serve.Summer pilau with tomato, coconut and cashewsThe tomatoes create a wonderful sauce with the coconut milk they also float up to decorate the dish.Serves 4 as a main course350g basmati rice2 tbsp rapeseed oil12 fresh curry leaves (available in Asian or larger supermarkets)4cm cinnamon stick1 large onion, finely sliced4 cloves of garlic, crushed1 green finger chilli, finely sliced50g unsalted cashews400g baby plum tomatoes, halved1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk1¾ tsp saltWash the rice in a few changes of cold water, then leave to soak in plenty of cold water.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wide frying pan and add the curry leaves and cinnamon stick. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the onion and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until it starts to turn golden brown and is soft. Add the garlic, chilli and cashews, and cook for a couple of minutes, then add the tomatoes and pop the lid on. Cook for about 8 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft.Drain the rice, add it to the pan and stir to combine. Add the coconut milk, 200ml of water and the salt. Stir again and bring the mixture to the boil, then put the lid on, turn the heat down to a whisper and cook for a further 15 minutes. Don’t be tempted to lift the lid, as the steam is key to cooking the rice. After 15 minutes, take off the heat and keep the lid on for a further 10 minutes to let the rice rest before eating. Serve with a fresh green salad.The Vietnamese are masters of the mouthwatering salad, elevating raw vegetables to heavenly places using a secret weapon, nuoc cham chay – a bright, hot, sweet-and-sour sauce that wakes up every neuron in your brain. Here the salad and its dressing are tucked into a deliciously crispy coconut and turmeric pancake.220g rice flour¾ tsp salt½ tsp ground turmeric1 medium egg400ml coconut milk200g red cabbage (around ¼), finely shredded2 slim carrots (150g), julienned5 spring onions, finely chopped40g fresh mixed herbs (Thai basil, coriander and mint), leaves picked and roughly chopped5 tbsp lime juice (from 3 limes)3½ tsp sugar1½ tbsp light soy sauce1½ bird’s-eye chillies, finely chopped2 cloves of garlic, crushedRapeseed oilFirst, make the batter for the pancakes: put the rice flour, salt, turmeric and egg into a bowl and mix together. Add the coconut milk and 175ml of water, whisk until you have a smooth batter, then leave to one side.Next, place the cabbage, carrots, spring onions and herbs into another bowl and mix with your hands. Make the sauce by putting the lime juice, sugar, soy sauce, chillies and garlic into a jug or small bowl and mixing well. Pour two-thirds of this sauce over the veg and mix again using your hands. Pour the remaining third into a little serving bowl.To make the pancakes, heat a teaspoon of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium flame and swirl it around the pan to coat. When the pan is very hot, pour in a ladleful of batter, swirling the pan quickly and carefully so that the batter reaches the edge. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden and crisp on the bottom (test this by sliding a palette knife under the pancake if it lifts away easily, it’s ready). Slide on to a plate and repeat with the rest of the batter, until you have 6 pancakes. Your first one may not be perfect, but don’t lose faith: you will quickly get the hang of it.To serve, place a small handful of the salad in the middle of the pancake and roll up. Serve with the extra sauce on the side.Milli’s matcha roll cake with raspberries and creamYou will need a Swiss roll tin as close in size to 25cm x 35cm as you can find.Serves 9 to 10100g plain flour2 tbsp matcha powder1 tsp baking powderPinch of salt4 large, fridge-cold eggs120g caster sugar150g raspberry jam200ml double cream20g icing sugar100g fresh raspberriesPreheat the oven to 200C (180C fan)400Fgas 6. Line your tin with non-stick baking paper, folding it tightly into the corners so the paper comes up the sides of the tray by 2cm.Sift together the flour, matcha, baking powder and salt. Separate the whites of the eggs from the yolks into two large bowls and add the caster sugar to the yolks. Using an electric hand-mixer, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks. Without cleaning the whisk, move on to the next bowl, whisking the yolks and caster sugar together for a couple of minutes until they double in volume, then stir the matcha flour mixture into the egg-yolk bowl.Using a large spatula, fold the egg whites into the yolks, being careful not to knock out too much air. Pour the batter into the lined tin and use a spatula to level the top. Tap the tray to release any air bubbles, then bake for 12 minutes, or until the sponge springs back to the touch.Take the cake out of the oven and leave to rest for exactly one minute, then place a sheet of baking paper over the top, followed by a large chopping board. Using oven gloves, turn the cake over and gently remove the tray. Carefully peel off the now top piece of baking paper and replace with a new sheet just slightly larger than the cake.Gently turn the cake back over again and pop it back into the tin.Take a sharp knife and, at one of the short ends of the cake, score a mark 2cm in, all the way along the width of the cake. Tuck that end of parchment over that edge of the cake and begin to loosely roll the sponge from one short end to the other, rolling the baking parchment with it. Transfer your roll to a cooling rack with the seam on the bottom. Loosely cover with a clean tea towel and leave to cool for 30 minutes.When cool, carefully unroll and spread the jam over the sponge, right to the edges. Whisk the double cream and the icing sugar together until you have soft peaks, then, leaving a 2cm border all around the sides, spread the cream on top of the jam so it is 1cm thick. Scatter over the raspberries and gently press them into the cream. Lifting the parchment at the scored end, roll the sponge up again fairly tightly (but without squeezing out the cream). Place on a tray, with the seam at the bottom, and transfer to the fridge for a couple of hours.When you are ready to serve, cut the roll into 9 or 10 even slices. This will keep in the fridge for two days, but is best eaten that day.I take a bite of this sweet rice pudding and I am back at my parents’ house at Diwali. Arya is 18 months old, shrieking with laughter. One more spoonful and she’s six months old and learning to eat she doesn’t wrinkle her nose at a simple kheer made with apples. A couple more spoonfuls and it’s 2015, I’m in Mumbai, it’s 2am and my husband Hugh has just arrived. I’ve been away for weeks, and now he’s here the kheer tastes like sweet celebration. Another spoonful and I’m six, struggling to fit in at a new school. I don’t tell Mum, but perhaps she knows because there’s kheer for pudding and it tastes like home.100g basmati rice1 tsp ground cardamom½ tsp ground cinnamon90g caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp to decorate700ml whole milk, plus extra if needed150ml double cream20g unsalted pistachios1½ tbsp dried edible flowers(such as marigolds, roses or lavender)Place the rice, spices, sugar, milk and cream in a large saucepan and set over a mediumlow heat. Bring to the boil – but watch it doesn’t boil over – then turn the heat down to a whisper and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring fairly frequently to make sure the rice doesn’t stick and burn. If the mixture is getting too dry, add more milk, a little at a time. When the rice is nearly done, it will start to bubble and burp more furiously and will need more attention. When the rice is tender (ie there is no chalkiness in the centre), take it off the heat and spoon into a serving bowl. Allow to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge until cold.Just before serving, grind the remaining tablespoon of sugar, the pistachios and the edible flowers as finely as you can, using a mortar and pestle or an electric spice grinder.

The striker, thought to be on the verge of a move to Serie A, took to Twitter on Friday to respond to criticisms that he lacks pace by posting statistics from a running test on the Perth leg of United’s July pre-season tour.Ole Gunnar Solskjær was among the United hierarchy to take a dim view of Lukaku ulging such information publicly. Lukaku, who is keen on a move to Juventus or Internazionale, has since removed the post, which revealed the Belgium forward was second to only Diogo Dalot in a session, which charted the speeds of 22 other first-team players. The tweet was accompanied by the words “lack of pace” alongside running emojis.Harry Maguire was undergoing a medical at United’s Carrington training ground on Saturday morning before finalising an £85m move from Leicester City, while Solskjær is keen to add further to his squad before Thursday’s transfer deadline. Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic have both been linked with moves to Old Trafford, though the former is understood to be sceptical about any move.A 24-man United squad are in Cardiff to play Milan in the International Champions Cup but Paul Pogba, who admitted in June that he wanted a new challenge, has not travelled.United said the France midfielder did not go to Wales because of a recurrence of a back spasm, though some reports have suggested Pogba skipped Friday’s flight from Manchester owing to his desire to force through a move.“At the end of the session today, Paul got a back spasm, the same issue he had last week, when he missed the session in Norway,” Solskjær said. “But I think he’ll be available early next week.”There have also been unconfirmed suggestions an administrative error led to him being wrongly named in the squad for the Milan game in Cardiff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b6264e136f6bc9af2dfc501f678262372f33889/0_109_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a667d15f0643cef1d0f8c12e49a0fb14","title":"football league and scottish premiership opening weekend live","story":"Fulham and Cardiff both had losing returns to the Football League, while in Scotland Celtic thrashed St Johnstone 7-0That’s all from me. It’s been an action-packed opening day of the season – just 10 months to go! Bye!The football hasn’t stopped: Will Unwin is your man for all Nottingham ForestWest Brom news:In fact only one just-promoted team has lost in the League this weekend, though two of them – Bury and MK Dons – had their game postponed. In League One Lincoln beat Accrington Stanley 2-0 but Tranmere went down 3-2 at home to Rochdale – they were 3-0 down in the 89th minute before threatening a ludicrous comeback Rochdale scored with their only three shots on target. In League Two, Salford beat Stevenage and Leyton Orient beat Cheltenham. Momentum, innit?Meanwhile none of the three teams promoted from League One last season have lost – Luton drew with Middlesbrough last night, while Charlton and Barnsley earned excellent wins over Blackburn and Fulham today.Two of the three teams relegated from the Premier League last season made losing returns to life in the Championship, Fulham losing at Barnsley and Cardiff at Wigan. The third, Huddersfield, get their campaign under way at home to Derby on Monday.And the final scores in the Scottish Premiership:Today’s final scores in the English Football League:Final score: Bradford 0-0 Cambridge Remarkable only for being the only goalless draw in the Football League this afternoon.GOAL! Reading 1-3 Sheffield Wednesday! Wednesday, a man down since their goalkeeper Kieren Westwood was sent off in the 80th minute, have wrapped up the win, Lucas Joao with a 97th-minute clincher!No penalty! Stoke insist they should have had a chance to equalise from the spot, but it’s not to be!Performance of the day: Dundee United’s Lawrence Shankland has had a home debut to remember: he scored all four goals in a 4-1 win (it hasn’t finished, so there may yet be more goals, but Shankland has been substituted) over Inverness Caley Thistle!Final whistles are going across the country, but at Stoke there will be five minutes’ stoppage time and they’ve only just started.Crystal Palace’s final pre-season fixture hasn’t gone so well: the final whistle has just blown on a 4-0 home defeat to Hertha Berlin, 11th in the Bundesliga last season.GOAL! Wycombe 2-0 Bolton! Bolton’s band of strangers look doomed to opening-day defeat. Fred Onyedinma, who signed for Wycombe for the third time last month – having previously had two loan spells there – has doubled his newold side’s advantage.The good news for St Johnstone is that it’s over, and they don’t have to play Celtic again for a while.This is getting silly now. Leigh Griffiths with the latest.GOAL! Stoke 1-2 QPR! Having been comprehensively outplayed for most of the game, Stoke now might not lose it – Sam Clucas has pulled a goal back.Red card! Cheltenham go down to nine! Leyton Orient took the lead against 11 men in the 68th minute, but within four minutes their opponents have had two men sent off. Luke Varney got a second booking, and now Rohan Ince has got a straight red!This sounds like an absolute cracker of a match. Cardiff were 1-0 up, then 2-1 down, then equalised, and now they’re losing once again, Lee Evans having scored the goal of the game, a curler from the corner of the area into the top far corner!Having reported on the five previous goals I might as well keep going.Omar Bogle, once of Wigan, has come off the bench to equalise for Cardiff!GOAL! Leyton Orient 1-0 Cheltenham! It’s been an emotional day at Leyton Orient, who held a minute’s silence for Justin Edinburgh before kick-off, and they might now mark the occasion with a win after Josh Wright game them a 68th-minute lead!Olivier Ntcham came on for the hat-trick hero Ryan Christie in the 71st minute, and he’s made it five for the Scottish champions in the 72nd!In today’s least competitive friendly, Wolfsburg have just gone 8-1 up against Nice.Since missing that penalty Josh Windass has turned the game, setting up one and now scoring a second!GOAL! Wycombe 1-0 Bolton! Bolton’s unfamiliar side, packed with debutants, teenagers and teenage debutants, held out for 56 minutes but Paul Smyth has just scored for Wycombe, tapping into the empty net after beating Remi Matthews to the ball.Ryan Christie completes his hat-trick with a left-footed thunderbolt that goes in off the bar.Michael Jacobs equalises for Wigan, from recent penalty-fluffer Josh Windass’s free kick!GOALS!

Here we go again!The first error ...Maybe Lamouchi will just bring off Muric at half-time ...JR rightly points out: “It doesn’t matter who West Brom has up front. If the opposing goalkeeper every week plays like Muric the Baggies are going undefeated!”You’d hope other goalkeepers won’t make as many mistakes.Get your Football League fix with John Brewin’s roundup:An incredible swing in the the first-half from Forest dominating to looking meek, not to mention Muric looking like a Sunday league goalkeeper. 45 mins: Chants of “Slaven Bilic” are going around the away end. 44 mins: No more dropballs! In my day we use to scrap for the ball with the opponent until we were covered in blood and mud. 42 mins: West Brom calmly pass the ball inside the box from a goal-kick like it’s the most normal thing in the world. Edwards gets some treatment after a heavy fall to the ground when attempting to jump for a header. 40 mins: Krovinovic misses the chase to slip either Phillips or Zohore through on goal, much to the West Brom pair’s annoyance. 38 mins: The home fans are not very pleased about the fact Livermore is holding onto Semedo’s shirt just inside the box for 10 seconds or so. The referee watches the whole incident but does nothing to appease those in red. 36 mins: Forest have been pretty awful since they opened the scoring. Can they can their early rhythm back? Grabban is yet to do much, so maybe Mir could be worth a go. 34 mins: Adomah tries to take on the rookie Ferguson but the debutant shows he is up to the task, perfectly timing a sliding challenge to dispossess the winger. He then shows a bit of naivety by taking a poor touch into the area, resulting in him bundling Adomah over but the referee is not interested. 32 mins: Due to the awfulness of Muric’s debut, Phillips whacks an optimistic low drive from 30 yards but even the Forest stopper can’t make a shot going 20 yards wide end up in the back of the net. 30 mins: Lolley cuts in from the left and then smashes a shot roughly 20 yards high and wide. Lamouchi applauds the effort but not the execution. 28 mins: Maybe Forest should have asked to take Claudio Bravo or Eike Immel on loan - it might have worked out better. Muric will not be watching this hame back in a hurry. Phillips whacks a hopeful cross into the box from the right flank but it ends up looping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner. Muric seemed to pull out of trying to save it, too, which makes it look worse. What an awful debut.24 mins: Silva whips in a free-kick from the right, forcing Ferguson to head the ball behind his own goal to avert any further danger. 22 mins: A very late challenge from Sawyer takes down Dawson are a loose pass in the middle of the park. The referee plays on but only has a quick word with the Baggies midfielder.20 mins: Edwards forces his way through down the left but his cross only makes it to the front post and is cleared. Down the other end Adomah chips a ball across the box where he almost finds Grabban but Bartley flicks it clear. 18 mins: Forest taking the sting out of the game by passing the ball around the back. This game cannot stay at the same tempo, to be fair.16 mins: Edwards looks lively and can use both feet, which might worry makeshift right-back Cash. He certainly does not lack confidence. Another goalkeeping mistake ensures the scores are level. Edwards shows some trickier in the box to get sufficient space to fire a shot across Muric with his left foot. It’s close to the goalkeeper but goes through his hands and into the bottom corner.14 mins: Sawyers tries to make something happen for West Brom on the edge of the Forest area but all he succeeds in doing is chip the ball into Muric’s hands. 12 mins: West Brom have offered almost nothing in the game so far. Forest are playing at a high tempo, while the visitors are just finding their feet.10 mins: Lamouchi enjoyed the goal on the sidelines. His job is now to keep the Forest players calm while the City Ground bounces. He might be playing right-back but Cash gets forward to exchange passes with Adomah, before letting the ball to bounce perfectly, allowing him to drive a low shot into the corner. Johnstone will be disappointed not to stop it, though.6 mins: Bartley takes a needless risk at the back by turning on the edge of his area but rather than being dispossessed a Forest forward fouls him instead. 4 mins: Lolley seems to be of the impression that Phillips has elbowed him in the face, so stays on the ground for far too long after coming together on the touchline. It’s been a pretty lively start overall, though. 2 mins: I’ll be honest, I am not completely sold on this version of the yellow and green away kit from West Brom. It seems a bit horrible. Cash whips over a cross from the right, which lands at the feet of Robinson, following a pitiful overhead kick attempt from Adomah, whose fearsome shot is blocked by debutant Ferguson. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let’s get ready to rumble!I am very pleased that West Brom go against the tide by being sponsored by Ideal Boilers rather than some random betting company. I do hope their legendary mascot is in attendance. Don Goodman has thrown out roughly 15 cliches in about 30 seconds of speech. Lovely stuff. I did the minute-by-minute for Luton v Middlesbrough last night, so if it’s another six-goal thriller I might not survive the day. Bilic spends a minute bigging up the Championship and then explains his team are good at football, claiming “we couldn’t be in better shape”.JR emails in to ask: “What do you make of the Throstles chances this season? Please feel free to say they’ll be mid-table because it seems pretty much everyone who tries to predict the Championship is wrong. Last season I was assured that Stoke would coast to the title and Norwich were no great shakes.“I’m really liking the looks of this squad. A bunch of nice additions have almost entirely erased the Pulis era from my memory.”Can I let you know at full-time? At the moment I don’t think they have enough up top with Zohore leading the line to challenge the top two. But who knows?Lamouchi says: “The first game, the stadium will be full, so it will be fantastic. We must make them proud with our players and our team”.I went to university in Nottingham but have no affinity for Forest as every time I went to watch them play they were bloody rubbish. Including in a goalless draw with Oldham, which involved no shots on target. I’ll be honest, I know nothing about Filip Krovinović, so watching him will be good fun. He’s on loan from Benfica, meaning he should be able to pass it a bit. A couple of West Brom arrivals have made this list of the best Championship signings ...Manchester City’s Aro Muric starts his first game for Forest after his loan move. He impressed in the League Cup last season but will be aiming to show what he can do over the course of an entire season.This the first game of the Lamouchi era. Daniel Taylor explains where it all went wrong for Martin O’Neill ...Lots of debuts around but Nathan Ferguson seems the happiest ...Sabri Lamouchi is up for the challenge. There is no doubting that football has returned to our bosom for us to hold and cherish.Like last night’s frenetic 3-3 draw between Luton and Middlesbrough, this clash also involves two managers enjoying their first match in charge of their respective clubs.Sabri Lamouchi has turned up in an attempt to bring back the glory days to the City Ground but he has the tough challenge of utilising a squad of 3384 players in order to do so. Slaven Bilic, on the other hand, will bring his good guy persona to West Brom in order to get his traditional new manager bounce before the wheels come off. Let’s see how wrong I am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e02cc1a0604bee07752c8ba423693cf6a0e562/0_1123_8055_4835/master/8055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feb5c463ade5d1b4de32a0708cdd604d","title":"perfectly polished a former varnish factory in east london","story":"A colourful artistic couple have converted an industrial space in Shoreditch into a vibrant homeIt has become less ravey since we moved in,” says Di Atkinson of Shoreditch back in the mid-90s, when the former factories and warehouses were just that. “Buildings were taken over for two-day raves and used as squats. It is more gentrified now.” Di, an author and historian, lives with her husband, the British artist, Patrick Hughes in Great Eastern street. The couple met in 1986 at the Chelsea Arts Club. Peer through the window at street level and you will be greeted with a pleasing vista: other people working. Number 72 is home to the atelier Reverspective.Inside, artists sit on swivel chairs surrounded by tables crammed with tubes of paint, brushes, rags and mixing palates. They are working on Patrick’s optical-illusion 3D canvases, creating intricate details of familiar scenes: the canals of Venice, a library, or surrealist images, a rainbow escaping from a box, a never-ending maze. This is Patrick’s business, making and selling his unique Reverspective artworks. Patrick and Di are old school: they live above the shop.In the 19th century, Hackney was famed for its furniture factories and warehouses. You can still locate their building’s Edwardian roots in the elaborate wood-panelled entrance, polished to perfection to brandish the varnish the factory made. When they moved in, almost 25 years ago, the building was derelict office space. They bought the ground floor and first floor and had the basement thrown in as a bonus. The building had been ided up, but was presented to them with everything ripped out: vast empty rooms with wires dangling from the ceiling.The apartment, which is triple-glazed to stave off the constant hum of traffic outside, is in essence an enormous white box, but clever configuration with furniture, rugs and shelving breaks up the space, making it homely. Leave the studio and take the original wooden factory stairs up and a large entrance hall on the first floor ushers you in. An Arts and Crafts sideboard, with a Heal’s Dali mirror above, displays the couple’s hat collection. An image by their neighbour, the photographer Tim Flach, from his “More Than Human” series decorates one wall while contemporary maze rugs by Anni Albers, produced by Christopher Farr, line the floor.Outside, life is hectic. Great Eastern Street is edgy and constantly switched on. Thanks to Hackney Council backing a night-time economy, the streets throng at night when people pour in to revel in the proliferation of bars. They come to feel radical, though in truth, it’s anything but. The majority of artists and free-thinkers have long gone, forced out by high rents – but not Patrick and Di.At 79, Patrick is probably the best-dressed man in Hackney, wearing a handmade pink and sky-blue checked suit for today’s shoot: “I am not in favour of dressing down. If everyone wears jeans and a T-shirt it is just not interesting.” A self-confessed surrealist, he has been attracted to the unconventional since he was a teenager, when he was introduced to the notorious Colony Room Club and ran away from home aged 17. From that moment he has embraced the surreal.“I prize the imagination,” he says. His early work focused on rainbows (he was known as the rainbow man) and were surrealist concoctions created in primary colours. “Rainbows are a revelation: different wavelengths that are seen as colours. It is pure magic. You can’t order them like a pizza, so it is fun to nail it down. I have done 100 rainbows and 1,000 Reverspectives. It is like being a miner trying to hack out gold from rock.”This erse design manifesto is central to the way they furnish their home. Each piece is chosen because “It makes us smile we don’t like to be sensible often. I have a wilful urge to muck about,” says Di, whose taste in vintage clothes is exemplary. “My instinct is to go off on a tangent. We are eclectic with modern surrealism influences.”They certainly are. Arts and Crafts chairs and tables sit in a corner neatly delineated by shelving filled with knitted suffragettes – a nod to Di’s work – a plastic model of Disney’s Snow White, copious books on British history and a tin of Liquorice Allsorts, all overseen by a vast oversized Anglepoise lamp, originally commissioned by the Roald Dahl Museum.On the windowsill a sculpture made entirely from teddies by their friend, the late Nancy Fouts, oversees all. A print of Meret Oppenheim’s 1936 fur cup and saucer hangs above a table with stork legs, also designed by Oppenheim. Fornasetti is a firm favourite and trinket pots line the bathroom. Glen Baxter and Philippe Starck are also popular with the couple. Starck designed the pissoir in the bathroom and his horn lights and gnomes also feature heavily. Monochrome curtains, by their friend Sue Timney, become theatrical drapes when pulled together, and her cushions fill their 1920s wooden settles.Following advice, they designed a space to retreat to and recreated the former varnish manager’s boardroom, with its original cornicing and two doors (one for the secretary). Their collection of 20th-century Whitefriars glass is displayed on the mantel and in the kitchen. Escher’s Night and Day print and Nancy Fout’s Match Tulip contribute to their penchant for the unusual. Patrick and Di may be old enough to enjoy free bus passes, but they’re still the most stylish couple in Shoreditch.

Some are natural storytellers, gossips even others get a kick out of unsettling the mighty. Some simply want to find things out to satisfy their natural curiosity.Most want to think their work has real-world impact, though I must confess that an awful lot of things I have written over the years have passed through this world without touching the sides.Usually it is the investigative types, the diggers and undercover reporters whose revelations lead to the biggest change, a minister toppled, a policy reversed.But not always. One of the many joys of editing the ’s Upside series – optimistic journalism that focuses on solutions, initiatives, innovations, people making a difference – is that it often ripples back out into the world it reported on, inspiring readers to take action, generating change for the better.For me, this is urgently needed in a world where a surfeit of dismal news – a crisis crisis if you like – is demoralising audiences as never before. We surely won’t fix the world if we keep on telling people that everything is rotten, hopeless, unfixable.While we have a duty to inform and educate society on where we are going wrong, we feel it is only proper we should point out where it is going right too. When we do, when we show what is possible, it can have a powerful virtuous effect on the lives of the people we write about.For example, earlier this year, we published the story of a pioneering group of Yazidi women who set up a female-only community in Syria as a safe space from the hideous violence and abuse they had faced at the hands of Isis.Within hours, emails were pouring in from readers asking how they could support the community. We gathered them together in a WhatsApp group and put them in touch with community leaders, so they could figure out how best to send money. One reader, Gill Whittaker, said the aim was “to do something together … Thus a more certain ‘upside’ outcome may be achieved”.Another example: last year we wrote about the Remakery, a cafe in Edinburgh that also fixes your broken appliances while you wait. Almost 100,000 people shared the article on social media. The piece became part of a virtuous circle, with people around the world getting in touch with the owner, Sophie Unwin, asking how they could set up a franchise in their city.“As a result of the piece I had more inquiries from across the UK (Nottingham, Brighton and elsewhere) and also internationally (one group in Montreal, others in the US) and I think a few others in Europe and New Zealand too,” Unwin told us. “Some people directly referenced the  feature and said they found it inspiring.“We’ve received other funding and are in conversation with other potential partners – there is a lot of interest. I would argue that the article also helped raise the wider agenda, as evidenced by news like Ikea’s work on the circular economy. Repair culture is moving more into the mainstream, which has always been one of the aims of this work.”When we wrote about an obscure cleric who drives around Iran’s poorest province bringing books to children, enough people were touched to club together and buy him a new car for his rounds.“This was a particularly cheering and hopeful piece in a climate of nastiness and Brexit tedium,” wrote Paul MacGowan. “I wonder if you could let me know if it’s possible for me to send donations to support his work?”A piece about paint recycling prompted no end of tips (and jokes) from readers. An article about an African environmentalist generated offers of legal support and a UN promise to champion her case. A focus on tree-planting in Niger brought inquiries from farmers in southern Africa. Best practice doesn’t always spread itself.The Upside has sought to deepen this connection between readers and subjects through a weekly newsletter, which attracts a prodigious digital mail bag each week. We continuously encourage our 30,000 subscribers to get in touch with alternatives, ideas and suggestions. When they do, others can be moved to get involved.“One of the pleasures was reading about the Green Ukhiya Star Team in The Upside,” wrote Beverley Colgan recently, referring to a little known Bangladeshi group planting 1m trees in the country’s south-east. “I went to their Facebook page but it had no big, obvious ‘contribute’ button.” We put Beverley in touch with the tree planters.Readers come up with great solutions, too. When we asked what people were doing to cut their carbon, we had hundreds of responses. The innovative things iniduals are doing in a dozen countries around the world prompted more readers to write in and commit to flying less, cycling more or eating less meat.When we asked people for their favourite foreign word that is hard to render into English, it threw up many ideas, notions, tendencies and instincts that some cultures have that others could benefit from. (My own favourites: saudade, turangawaewae, philotimo).The media must recognise it shapes the world we live in, as well as reflecting it.

The OBR sees property transactions falling by a fifth in the event of no deal, which is bad news for estate agents, removal companies and retailers of furniture, carpets and curtains.But there are always those who have to buy or sell because their job has moved or their family has expanded. What should they do? If you’re the seller, don’t fall for the estate agent’s trick of over-pricing a property to get the business, then slashing later to get a sale. Examine actual sold prices on your road – Zoopla has an easily searchable database – and take a bit off to reflect today’s market.Buyers have a choice defer a purchase until November to get clarity on Brexit (but if there is a deal, then prices could start moving up again) or make cheeky low-ball offers and see if a vendor is desperate enough to accept. How do you know a seller is desperate? One way is to search the property’s listing history – most sites will say how long ago it came to market, but won’t say if it was removed then relisted with a reduced price. But there are tricks, such as those listed at Propcision, to find old data from Google.There is far less data available on rental markets, but if a landlord tries to increase the rent in this market they’re having a laugh do your best to challenge it.What you can doThe other strategy is to take out a tracker mortgage that moves down (and up) in line with Bank of England base rate.However, buyers need to be aware that if interest rates went up substantially later on, payments would rise accordingly, says L\u0026ampC’s David Hollingworth. He says most buyers will still want to stick with a fixed-rate deal, given that they are still at very low historical levels, and buyers have the security of knowing what they paying for its term.What you can doSterling’s slide this week is the canary in the Brexit coal mine, as traders began marking the pound down to what they think it might be worth in the event of a no-deal exit. Against the euro, the pound fell below €1.10, while against the dollar it was heading to $1.20. A disorderly departure could see the pound fall to one-to-one parity against the euro and the dollar even before the 31 October deadline.One indication comes from betting company Boyle Sports. At the start of year it was giving punters odds of only 8-1 that the pound would collapse to be worth just one euro, but has slashed the odds to 3-1 that we’ll reach that point some time this year.What you can doIf you think the pound will continue to tumble, then buying your holiday money now makes sense, even at today’s depressed levels. Don’t ever buy currency at an airport bureau de change, where rates for euros are already fantastically low, with many giving you just 0.9 euros for each pound. Buy online and in advance for much better deals you’ll get around €1.06 for each pound from Travelex online this week. See our separate guide to getting the best deal on holiday money. The currency’s collapse would make everything in overseas resorts this summer more expensive. It’s probably too late for most people now, but late bookers may want to consider half-board or all-inclusive options to control the costs.There is also an argument for booking very early this year for travel such as ski holidays. If the pound falls heavily the tour operators will be forced to raise prices in sterling, so locking a price now may make sense. Or decide to take your next holiday in the UK.If you want to take a punt against sterling and make some money by trading, all you need is a credit card and an initial deposit of around £100-£200 to join online forex traders such as eToro, City Index and so on. The big high street banks also let you trade, with minimum deposits starting at £10,000. But forex trading is fantastically risky, and only those able to afford to lose a lot money should even begin trying.Workers with final salary-style pensions aren’t affected, as they have guarantees, but for everyone else, their pension pot depends on the performance of the stock market. Which way will markets go in a Brexit crash-out?Broadly speaking, domestically focused UK companies, which make most of their profits in the UK, will be obvious casualties and their share prices could fall heavily in the next few months. But the giants of the London stock market – such as BP, Shell, HSBC and Glaxo – make the vast majority of their profits in overseas markets, and are much better protected from Brexit. Indeed, as sterling plummets they are likely to rise in value, because their dollar earnings suddenly become worth much more in pounds.What you can doMost people think they can’t do anything about their company pension scheme, but they can.You have to find out who manages your pension scheme, and then see what level of control you have. For example, Legal \u0026amp General manages 14,000 pension schemes for 2.8 million workers across the UK, including those at GNM, the ’s parent group.Members can view the value of their pension, and make choices about where the money goes, picking between cash, equity (shares) and bonds (which pay fixed rates of interest but can also go up and down in value).If you are convinced that a Boris Johnson-led Brexit is going to be a calamity, that the economy will tank and UK corporate profits collapse, then you can choose to shift your pension into overseas shares.If you believe in a total disaster – a view not shared by investment experts – you could even choose to put all of your pension into a cash fund, which means it won’t be affected by a fall in the stock market. Alternatively, if you believe that no deal won’t be that bad, then that would suggest you buy into domestic UK companies which could enjoy a huge “relief rally”. But remember, going to any extremes in investing (ie, all your money in cash, or all in one particular market) is a very risky thing to do for the long term, with almost nobody able to expertly time their investments to catch major market swings.A  Money reader asked us this week what to do about his old privatisation and demutualisation shares in the event of no deal. He holds both Lloyds (as a result of the Halifax demutualisation) and Santander. Should he sell them, he asked, fearful that a no-deal Brexit will send them crashing.What you can doWe’re not going to give advice on inidual shares, but here are a few pointers. Lloyds is a UK-focused bank which makes nearly all its profits in the UK. Therefore it is in the bucket of shares not particularly attractive to worldwide investors, and if there is a recession after no deal, it is the most exposed to customers defaulting on their loans.But its shares have been weak for a long time. It was 72p a share just before the referendum, and is 52p now. It’s arguable that the damage from Brexit is already in the price, although it can always sink lower. It has returned to paying idends, so the yield on the shares is actually quite attractive. If you have no urgent financial need to sell, it may be worth holding for the long term, but expect bumps along the way.Santander is a global bank with a big British operation. So it is impacted by Brexit, but much less so than Lloyds. That said, its shares have, if anything, performed worse than Lloyds. They have fallen from €6.18 in 2017 to €3.90 this week. Maybe the lesson is that, after the financial crisis, investors are wary of banks, and that they will never again be growth stocks, and you should hold them instead for a steady supply of idends.What you can doRealistically, most people can do very little about the threat of job losses, particularly if they are in low-skilled positions.If your job does look at risk – car plants such as Ford and Vauxhall come to mind – about the best you can do is try to build up some savings to tide you over. According to the government’s Money Advice Service, “a good rule of thumb to give yourself a solid financial cushion is to have three months’ essential outgoings available in an instant access savings account”. But sadly few people are able to save that much. According to Aviva, low income families typically only have around £100 in savings.On a late autumn trip to the continent, after Britain has crashed out of the EU with no deal, you find yourself having been pulled over by a gendarme 20km outside Calais. Heshe will want to see your UK driving licence, your international driving permit (IDP 1968), your insurance green card, the car’s log book (V5 document) and a GB sticker. Tourists flying into the EU and hiring a car will also need an IDP in several countries including Italy, France and the Netherlands. It is this that is likely to catch out future travellers.What you should doIf you are heading abroad after 31 October, you need to take all these items with you. The Post Office will sell you an IDP for £5.50 – you’ll need to show your UK licence and passport. But they will only be required in some countries following a no-deal Brexit tourists hiring a car in Spain or Portugal won’t need one for stays of up to six months.If there is a deal, UK licence holders will continue to be able to drive using their UK driving licence while visiting all EU and EEA countries. Your car insurer will supply your green card.A no-deal crash-out leaves many of the 1.3 million Brits living in the EU facing a major problem – what will happen if they are rushed to their local hospital? A no-deal departure ends the UK’s involvement in the European health insurance card scheme and other agreements overnight. While it is bad news for holidaymakers, it has the potential to force many of those who live in the EU to abandon their dream.What you can doFor those going on holiday, it is simply a case of buying travel insurance before you leave, and the government is advising just that. For those living abroad, Spain has said it will guarantee continued healthcare access to British expats and tourists in the country until the end of 2020 – provided the UK offers Spaniards here the same deal.This is highly likely as the UK government has said seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights is a top priority.In France, another country in which lots of retired Brits live, the position is more complicated, particularly for those who are more temporary – spending just six months there at a time. They are being advised to formalise their residency where they can.It’s been reported that France is confident of reaching a bilateral agreement with the UK on health care – helped no doubt by the fact that there are lots of French people living and working in London.Other countries face the same challenge. The problem for some Brits is that those agreements will not be in position by 31 October. Those with dangerous ailments may have to consider returning to the UK temporarily.Medicine availability is what vexes people more seriously. Critical and short shelf-life medicines – some of which may need to be refrigerated until they are consumed – would be most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario, with fears they could be held up amid chaos at the ports.Already there are reports of diabetics informally stockpiling their own supplies of insulin by giving themselves less on a daily basis, with potentially dangerous consequences.But the government says the fears are misplaced, as drug companies have already been told to build up an additional six weeks’ supply of medicines to provide a buffer in the event of gridlock at Dover.What you can doThis suggests that if you have an eye on a new BMW or Mercedes, it might be worth bringing forward your purchase to before October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2690026ebc985dfc028b595bacf66b6610585d/0_0_3513_2108/master/3513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301eb02a510c004b22f7ffd849147442","title":"athleisure barre kale tyranny ideal woman labour","story":"How we became suckers for the hard labor of self-optimization. By  Jia TolentinoThe ideal woman has always been generic. I bet you can picture the version of her that runs the show today. She’s of indeterminate age but resolutely youthful presentation. She’s got glossy hair and the clean, shameless expression of a person who believes she was made to be looked at. She is often luxuriating when you see her – on remote beaches, under stars in the desert, across a carefully styled table, surrounded by beautiful possessions or photogenic friends. Showcasing herself at leisure is either the bulk of her work or an essential part of it in this, she is not so unusual – for many people today, especially for women, packaging and broadcasting your image is a readily monetizable skill. She has a personal brand, and probably a boyfriend or husband: he is the physical realization of her constant, unseen audience, reaffirming her status as an interesting subject, a worthy object, a self-generating spectacle with a viewership attached.Can you see this woman yet? She looks like an Instagram – which is to say, an ordinary woman reproducing the lessons of the marketplace, which is how an ordinary woman evolves into an ideal. The process requires maximal obedience on the part of the woman in question, and – ideally – her genuine enthusiasm, too. This woman is sincerely interested in whatever the market demands of her (good looks, the impression of indefinitely extended youth, advanced skills in self-presentation and self-surveillance). She is equally interested in whatever the market offers her – in the tools that will allow her to look more appealing, to be even more endlessly presentable, to wring as much value out of her particular position as she can.The ideal woman, in other words, is always optimizing. She takes advantage of technology, both in the way she broadcasts her image and in the meticulous improvement of that image itself. Her hair looks expensive. She spends lots of money taking care of her skin, a process that has taken on the holy aspect of a spiritual ritual and the mundane regularity of setting a morning alarm.The work formerly carried out by makeup has been embedded directly into her face: her cheekbones or lips have been plumped up, or some lines have been filled in, and her eyelashes are lengthened every four weeks by a professional wielding inidual lashes and glue. The same is true of her body, which no longer requires the traditional enhancements of clothing or strategic underwear it has been pre-shaped by exercise that ensures there is little to conceal or rearrange.Everything about this woman has been pre-emptively controlled to the point that she can afford the impression of spontaneity and, more important, the sensation of it – having worked to rid her life of artificial obstacles, she often feels legitimately carefree. The ideal woman can be whatever she wants to be – as long as she manages to act upon the belief that perfecting herself and streamlining her relationship to the world can be a matter of both work and pleasure, or, in other words, of “lifestyle”. The ideal woman steps into a stratum of expensive juices, boutique exercise classes, skincare routines and vacations, and there she happily remains.Most women believe themselves to be independent thinkers. Even glossy women’s magazines now model skepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look, who and when we should marry, how we should live. But the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her. If women start to resist an aesthetic, like the overapplication of Photoshop, the aesthetic just changes to suit us the power of the ideal image never actually wanes. It is now easy enough to engage women’s skepticism toward ads and magazine covers, images produced by professionals. It is harder for us to suspect images produced by our peers, and nearly impossible to get us to suspect the images we produce of ourselves, for our own pleasure and benefit – even though, in a time when heavy social media use has become broadly framed as a career asset, many of us are effectively professionals now, too.Today’s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form. This sort of feminism has organized itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible it has greatly over-valorized women’s inidual success. Feminism has not eradicated the tyranny of the ideal woman but, rather, has entrenched it and made it trickier. These days, it is perhaps even more psychologically seamless than ever for an ordinary woman to spend her life walking toward the idealized mirage of her own self-image. She can believe – reasonably enough, and with the full encouragement of feminism – that she herself is the architect of the exquisite, constant and often pleasurable type of power that this image holds over her time, her money, her decisions, her selfhood and her soul.Figuring out how to “get better” at being a woman is a ridiculous and often amoral project – a subset of the larger, equally ridiculous, equally amoral project of learning to get better at life under accelerated capitalism. In these pursuits, most pleasures end up being traps, and every public-facing demand escalates in perpetuity. Satisfaction remains, under the terms of the system, necessarily out of reach.But the worse things get, the more a person is compelled to optimize. I think about this every time I do something that feels particularly efficient and self-interested, like going to a barre class or eating lunch at a fast-casual chopped-salad chain, like Sweetgreen, which feels less like a place to eat and more like a refueling station. I’m a repulsively fast eater in most situations – my boyfriend once told me that I chew like someone’s about to take my food away – and at Sweetgreen, I eat even faster because (as can be true of many things in life) slowing down for even a second can make the machinery give you the creeps. Sweetgreen is a marvel of optimization: a line of 40 people – a texting, shuffling, eyes-down snake – can be processed in 10 minutes, as customer after customer orders a kale caesar with chicken without even looking at the other, darker-skinned, hairnet-wearing line of people who are busy adding chicken to kale caesars as if it were their purpose in life to do so and their customers’ purpose in life to send emails for 16 hours a day with a brief break to snort down a bowl of nutrients that ward off the unhealthfulness of urban professional living.The ritualization and neatness of this process (and the fact that Sweetgreen is pretty good) obscure the intense, circular artifice that defines the type of life it’s meant to fit into. The ideal chopped-salad customer needs to eat his $12 salad in 10 minutes because he needs the extra time to keep functioning within the job that allows him to afford a regular $12 salad in the first place. He feels a physical need for this $12 salad, as it’s the most reliable and convenient way to build up a vitamin barrier against the general malfunction that comes with his salad-requiring-and-enabling job. As Matt Buchanan wrote at the Awl in 2015, the chopped salad is engineered to “free one’s hand and eyes from the task of consuming nutrients, so that precious attention can be directed toward a small screen, where it is more urgently needed, so it can consume data: work email or Amazon’s nearly infinite catalog or Facebook’s actually infinite News Feed, where, as one shops for diapers or engages with the native advertising sprinkled between the not-hoaxes and baby photos, one is being productive by generating revenue for a large internet company, which is obviously good for the economy, or at least it is certainly better than spending lunch reading a book from the library, because who is making money from that?”On today’s terms, what Buchanan is describing is the good life. It means progress, iniduation. It’s what you do when you’ve gotten ahead a little bit, when you want to get ahead some more. The hamster-wheel aspect has been self-evident for a long time now. But today, in an economy defined by precarity, more of what was merely stupid and adaptive has turned stupid and compulsory. Vulnerability, which is ever present, must be warded off at all costs. And so I go to Sweetgreen on days when I need to eat vegetables very quickly because I’ve been working till 1am all week and don’t have time to make dinner because I have to work till 1am again, and like a chump, I try to make eye contact across the sneeze guard, as if this alleviated anything about the skyrocketing productivity requirements that have forced these two lines of people to scarf and create kale caesars all day, and then I “grab” my salad and eat it in under 10 minutes while looking at email.It’s very easy, under conditions of artificial but continually escalating obligation, to find yourself organizing your life around practices you find ridiculous and possibly indefensible. Women have known this intimately for a long time.I was a late bloomer in terms of functional physical practices, like eating vegetables and exercising. I was a gymnast as a kid and then a cheerleader later, but one thing was fun and the second was effectively a requirement: at my school, you had to play a sport, and I lacked the hand-eye coordination to do anything else. As a teenager, I subsisted on pizza and queso and cinnamon rolls, trying to immunize myself with apathy and pleasure-seeking throughout the long stretch of time when girls, overwhelmed by sudden expectations of beauty, transmit anorexia and bulimia to one another like a virus. For the better part of a decade, I figured I was better off being slightly unhealthy and leaving the active pursuit of body-related matters alone.This all changed when I was 21 and volunteering in the Peace Corps. Under the circumstances, it was impossible to think too much about my appearance, and health was of such immediate importance it was always on my mind. I started doing yoga in my room every day as a prophylactic measure against mental breakdown. When I returned to America in 2011, I kept at it. Yoga helped me be gentle to myself during the process of readjustment, when I was constantly flooded with dread and spiritual uselessness, the sense that I had failed.And then, in 2012, at the end of a yoga class, I felt something shift. I was in grad school, deep in a period of daytime beers and open-ended self-discovery, and I was lying in final resting pose, suddenly wondering why motionlessness was supposed to be relaxing. The specter of stagnation hung heavy over my existence. I missed, suddenly, the part of me that thrilled to sharpness, harshness, discipline. I had been directing these instincts at my mind, hiding them from my body, but why? At that moment I needed something stronger than yoga, the unrestricted ease of which had reminded me, just then, that I didn’t know what I was doing, and likely never would.So, later that week, I printed out a Groupon trial offer at a studio called Pure Barre. I was greeted by an instructor who looked like Jessica Rabbit: ice-green eyes, a physically impossible hourglass figure, honey-colored hair rippling down past her waist. She ushered me into a cave-dark room full of sinewy women gathering mysterious red rubber props. The front wall was mirrored. The women stared at their reflections, stone-faced, preparing.Then class started, and it was an immediate state of emergency. Barre is a manic and ritualized activity, often set to deafening music and lighting changes. The rapid-fire series of positions and movements, dictated and enforced by the instructor, resembled what a ballerina might do if you concussed her and then made her snort caffeine pills – a fanatical, repetitive routine of arm gestures, leg lifts and pelvic tilts.By the end of class, my leg muscles had liquefied. Jessica turned the lights off and chirped that it was time for “back dancing”, a term that I thought, collapsing on to the floor, sounded like what people on a parenting message board might use as a euphemism for sex. It was, in fact, pretend-fucking: we lay on our backs and thrust our hips into the darkness with a sacrificial devotion that I had not applied to actual sex for years. The lights went on. Jessica cooed: “Great job, ladies.” Everybody clapped.Barre was invented in the 60s by Lotte Berk, a Jewish ballerina who developed an exercise method based on her dance training, and at 46, with her rigidly disciplined body as a walking billboard, founded a women-only exercise studio in a basement on London’s Manchester Street. It is now a national fixture across the US. The rise of barre is unparalleled in a few aspects: as far as exercise methods go, nothing this expensive and this uniform has gone this big. Hot yoga and pilates are both ubiquitous, but the pursuits have expanded at the level of inidual studios rather than nationwide chains. (Yoga classes also mostly hover around $20 or less, where barre, if you pay full price, often costs double that.) Among hundreds of thousands of women in dramatically different political and cultural environments, there seems to be an easy agreement that barre is worth it.In grad school in the midwest, I became a believer. I had been primed, first with my girlishly regimented physical training – dance, gymnastics, cheerleading – and then with yoga, my therapeutic on-ramp to the thing I was slowly realizing, which was that you could, without obvious negative consequences, control the way your body felt on the inside and worked on the outside by paying people to give you orders in a small, mirrored room. Barre was much too expensive for my grad school budget, but I kept paying for it. It seemed like an investment in a more functional life.Was it health I was investing in? In a very narrow way, it was. Barre has made me stronger and improved my posture. It has given me the luxury – off-limits to so many people, for so many stupid reasons – of not having to think about my body, because it mostly feels good, mostly works.But the endurance that barre builds is possibly more psychological than physical. What it’s really good at is getting you in shape for a hyper-accelerated capitalist life. It prepares you less for a half marathon than for a 12-hour workday, or a week alone with a kid and no childcare, or an evening commute on an underfunded train. Barre feels like exercise the way Sweetgreen feels like eating: both might better be categorized as mechanisms that help you adapt to arbitrary, prolonged agony. As a form of exercise, barre is ideal for an era in which everyone has to work constantly – you can be back at the office in five minutes, no shower necessary – and in which women are still expected to look unreasonably good.And of course it’s that last part, the looks thing, that makes barre feel so worthwhile to so many people. Barre is results-driven and appearance-based – it’s got the cultishness of CrossFit or a boot camp class, but with looks, not strength, as its primary goal. It’s only vaguely connected to ballet in terms of your actual movements, but conceptually, ballet is essential to the pitch. Among women, ballerinas have a uniquely legitimate reason to look taut and disciplined. There are plenty of other women who are thin and graceful-looking by professional requirement – models, escorts, actors – but ballerinas meet the beauty standard not just in the name of appearance or performance but also in the name of high athleticism and art. And so an exercise method even nominally drawn from ballet has the subtle effect of giving regular women a sense of serious, artistic, professional purpose in their pursuit of their ideal body. This is a good investment or, more precisely, a pragmatic self-delusion. Learning how to function more efficiently within an exhausting system: this seems to me to be the thing, with barre, that people pay $40 a class for, the investment that always brings back returns.The term “optimize” was used for the first time the way we currently use it, in economics, in the mid 19th century. “To satisfy our wants to the utmost with the least effort – to procure the greatest amount of what is desirable at the expense of the least that is undesirable – in other words, to maximize pleasure, is the problem of economics,” wrote William Stanley Jevons in The Theory of Political Economy. We all want to get the most out of what we have.Today, the principle of optimization – the process of making something, as the dictionary puts it, “as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible” – thrives in extremity. An entire industry has even sprung up to give optimization a uniform: athleisure, the type of clothing you wear when you are either acting on or signaling your desire to have an optimized life. I define athleisure as exercise gear that you pay too much money for, but defined more broadly, athleisure was a $97bn category by 2016.Since its emergence around a decade ago, athleisure has gone through a few aesthetic iterations. At first, it was black leggings and colorful tank tops – a dex version of an early-aughts going-out uniform favored by women who might have, by the time of athleisure’s rise, shifted their daily social interactions to yoga and coffee dates. More recently, athleisure has branched off and reconverged in permutations. There is a sort of cosmic hippie look (elaborate prints, webbed galaxy patterns), a sort of monochrome LA look (mesh, neutrals, baseball hats), a minimalist and heathered Outdoor Voices aesthetic, and an influx of awful slogans like “I’ll See You at the Barre”. Brands include Lululemon (“Wunder Under High-Rise Tights”, described as “edgy”, cost $98), Athleta (“Pacifica Contoured Hoodie Tank”, a hooded tank top, is $59), Sweaty Betty (“Power Wetlook Mesh Crop Leggings”, which are “Bum Sculpting? You Bet Your Ass”, $120), the ghoulish brand Spiritual Gangster (leggings with “Namaste” across the ass, $88 cotton tank top screen-printed with “I’ll see it when I believe it”, $56).Men wear athleisure, but the idea, and the vast majority of the category, belongs to women. It was built around the habits of stay-at-home mums, college students, fitness professionals, off-duty models – women who wore exercise clothing outside an exercise setting and who, like ballerinas, have heightened reasons to monitor the market value of their looks. This deep incentive is hidden by a bunch of more obvious ones: these clothes are easy to wear, machine-washable, wrinkle-proof. Athleisure – like all optimization experiences and products – is reliably comfortable and supportive in a world that is not. In 2016, Moira Weigel wrote, at Real Life magazine, “Lululemons announce that for the wearer, life has become frictionless.” She recalls putting on a pair of Spanx shapewear for the first time: “The word for how my casing made me feel was optimized.”Spandex – the material in both Spanx and expensive leggings – was invented during the second world war, when the military was trying to develop new parachute fabrics. It is uniquely flexible, resilient and strong. It feels comforting to wear high-quality dex, but this sense of reassurance is paired with an undercurrent of demand. Shapewear controls the body under clothing athleisure broadcasts your commitment to controlling your body through working out. And to even get into a pair of Lululemons, you have to have a disciplined-looking body. (The founder of the company once said that “certain women” aren’t meant to wear his brand.) “Self-exposure and self-policing meet in a feedback loop,” Weigel wrote. “Because these pants only ‘work’ on a certain kind of body, wearing them reminds you to go out and get that body.”This is how athleisure has carved out the space between exercise apparel and fashion: the former category optimizes your performance, the latter optimizes your appearance, and athleisure does both simultaneously. It is tailor-made for a time when work is rebranded as pleasure so that we will accept more of it – a time when, for women, improving your looks is a job that you’re supposed to believe is fun. And the real trick of athleisure is the way it can physically suggest that you were made to do this – that you’re the kind of person who thinks that putting in expensive hard work for a high-functioning, maximally attractive consumer existence is about as good a way to pass your time on Earth as there is.I recently bought my first pair of Spanx in preparation for a wedding. My oldest friend was getting married in Texas, and the bridesmaids’ dresses – for all 13 of us – were pale pink, floor-length and as tight as shrink-wrap from the strapless neckline to the knees. When I first tried the dress on, I could see the inside of my belly button in the mirror. Frowning, I went online and bought a $98 “Haute Contour® High-Waisted Thong”. It arrived a few days later, and I tried it on with the dress: I couldn’t breathe properly, I immediately started sweating and everything looked even worse. “What the fuck,” I said, staring at my reflection. I looked like a bad imitation of a woman whose most deeply held personal goal was to look hot in pictures. And of course, in that moment, in a $98 punishment thong and a dress designed for an Instagram model, that’s exactly what I was.The ideal woman looks beautiful, happy, carefree and perfectly competent. Is she really? To look any particular way and to actually be that way are two separate concepts, and striving to look carefree and happy can interfere with your ability to feel so. The internet codifies this problem, makes it inescapable in recent years, pop culture has started to reflect the fractures in selfhood that social media creates. Not coincidentally, these stories usually center on women, and usually involve a protagonist driven to insanity by the digital avatar of an ideal peer. There is an exaggerated binary fatalism to these stories, in which women are either successes or failures, always one or the other – and a sense of inescapability that rings more true to life. If you can’t escape the market, why stop working on its terms?Women are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy – two systems that, at their extremes, ensure that inidual success comes at the expense of collective morality. And yet there is enormous pleasure in inidual success. It can feel like license and agency to approach an ideal, to find yourself – in a good picture, on your wedding day, in a flash of identical movement – exemplifying a prototype. There are rewards for succeeding under capitalism and patriarchy there are rewards even for being willing to work on its terms. There are nothing but rewards, at the surface level. The trap looks beautiful. It’s well-lit. It welcomes you in.There is a case, as laid out by Donna Haraway in her tricky 1985 essay A Cyborg Manifesto, for understanding the female condition as essentially, fundamentally adulterated and for seeking a type of freedom compatible with that state. “At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg,” she wrote. The cyborg was a “hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction”. The late 20th century had “made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.”Haraway imagined that women, formed in a way that makes us inextricable from social and technological machinery, could become fluid and radical and resistant. We could be like cyborgs – shaped in an image we didn’t choose for ourselves, and disloyal and disobedient as a result. “Illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential,” Haraway wrote. The cyborg was “oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence”. She would understand that the terms of her life had always been artificial. She would – and what an incredible possibility! – feel no respect whatsoever for the rules by which her life played out.In real life, women are so much more obedient. Our rebellions are so trivial and small. Lately, the ideal women of Instagram have started chafing, just a little, against the structures that surround them. The anti-Instagram statement is now a predictable part of the modelinfluencer social media life cycle: a beautiful young woman who goes to great pains to maintain and perform her own beauty for an audience will eventually post a note on Instagram revealing that Instagram has become a bottomless pit of personal insecurity and anxiety. She’ll take a week-long break from the social network, and then, almost always, she will go on exactly as before. Resistance to a system is almost always presented on the terms of the system. It’s so much easier, when we gain agency, to use it to adapt rather than to oppose.Technology, in fact, has made us less than oppositional: where beauty is concerned, we have deployed technology not only to meet the demands of the system but to actually expand these demands. The realm of what is possible for women has been exponentially expanding in all beauty-related capacities – think of the extended Kardashian experiments in body modification, or the young models whose plastic surgeons have given them entirely new faces – and remained stagnant in many other ways. We have not “optimized” our wages, our childcare system, our political representation we still hardly even think of parity as realistic in those arenas, let alone anything approaching perfection. We have maximized our capacity as market assets. That’s all.For the way out, I think, we have to follow the cyborg. We have to be willing to be disloyal, to undermine. The cyborg is powerful because she grasps the potential in her own artificiality, because she accepts without question how deeply it is embedded in her. It’s possible if we want it. But what do we want? What would you want – what desires, what forms of insubordination, would you be able to access – if you had succeeded in becoming an ideal woman, gratified and beloved, proof of the efficiency of a system that magnifies and diminishes you every day? • Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino is published by 4th Estate on 8 August.

The fact is that a lot of people living around Brecon are more insulated from the problems of society than people living elsewhere. Oliver ElkingtonA pretty close result in the end. Tory party would have held it if Brexit party hadn’t taken so many votes, or if GreensPlaid had not stood aside. The Brexit debacle is so serious party politics should take a back seat. Hopefully the progressive alliance will hold and Borish Johnson will be too up himself to get a pact going with Farage. Not sure where Labour fit in the battle of the coalitions, but not a great night for them either. RedSalamanderI’m delighted that a party which unequivocally opposes Brexit won last night.But we shouldn’t get carried away. Johnson will be pretty relieved at how the Conservative vote held up and if you add Conservative and Brexit Party vote share together, then their combined vote is higher than the Lib Dems. He will push the line that if you want Brexit delivered, you have to swing behind the Conservatives.On Labour: nobody is fooled by Corbyn’s ‘“constructive ambiguity” any more. It’s blatantly obvious that he wants Brexit and all his dithering and vagueness is intended to mug off his own party. TheGoodThiefThe remain-alliance’s total votes are less than the Conservative plus Brexit plus UKIP total, so expect plenty of politicians saying that this shows that the Tories need to move to a harder Brexit.More interesting to me is the Brexit politicians who are saying that they wouldn’t vote for a version of the withdrawal agreement without the backstop, showing that Boris Johnson either doesn’t know his own party, or has been lying whenever he’s suggested that a WA without the backstop could pass Parliament. octaariThe polls tell us there is a Boris Johnson bounce – they are back in the lead. And given the circumstances of this by-election, a seat they’d been widely expected to lose heavily from what I’ve read over the past few weeks, the narrow losing margin seems to confirm that.What the result shows is what can be achieved through electoral alliances. The winning margin was about the same as Plaid Cymru’s vote at the last election, and they didn’t stand this time. The Brexit Party’s 3,300 votes would have given the Tories a comfortable majority. Very grim result for Labour. stringvestorThere is still a substantial pro-Brexit vote out there. That is not surprising since we have not yet left the EU and what might happen is still speculation. Whereas we are still in the EU and people can blame everything they do not like on Brussels. Let’s see how the Brexit vote holds up after we have left and the consequences start to kick in.

Shared equally, it would amount to about £57,000 for each of England’s 353 councils and combined authorities, according to the ’s calculation.The Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “The idea that £20m across the 353 main councils of England is enough to prepare is an insult to our intelligence and to the hard work of public servants struggling with the consequences of the government’s decision to force a vicious Brexit on us.”Criticism intensified after a MHCLG spokeswoman admitted half the pledged funding comes from the chancellor Sajid Javid’s £2.1bn announcement on Thursday. The other half comes from funding announced by the department in January, she added.“This offers no new money and no new ideas for how to address the cliff-edge councils are facing,” Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, said.The Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said: “This extra money is a drop in the ocean for cash-strapped councils desperately concerned about what no-deal Brexit will mean for crucial public services in their areas.”Councils across the country welcomed the funding but highlighted the shortfall they are already facing.Kevin Bentley, the chairman of the Brexit taskforce at the Local Government Association, said: “With councils already facing a funding gap of more than £3bn in 201920, it is more important now than ever that councils receive the resources they need for their ongoing Brexit preparations.“There remains information and advice gaps that councils are facing while helping their communities prepare, which need to be met by the government.“Councils also need certainty to plan for their communities over the longer term, such as on the domestic replacement for EU funding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca36e9c1b7deacb4212331ef3808bd882141dbc1/0_36_5056_3034/master/5056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39026bc4966b057f03fa3bc32a304323","title":"sports quiz week football cricket ashes transfers","story":"Who moved?

In claiming the first pole position of his career at the Hungarian Grand Prix he also became the first Dutch driver to claim the top spot in Formula One. It was, moreover, a further statement of his talent and another more than welcome challenge to the Mercedes F1 hegemony.Verstappen did so for Red Bull with a flawless lap of the Hungaroring, although pushed to the limit by the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who is in second place. Lewis Hamilton, also for Mercedes, is third with Charles Leclerc next, heading Sebastian Vettel, in the Ferraris.Pole has been a long time coming for a man who is still deceptively young. Verstappen is only 21 but is in his fifth season in F1. Having become the youngest driver to compete in the sport, and its youngest winner, he was entirely unconcerned that he was only its fourth youngest driver to claim pole. He has matured so much in those five years that, while he was elated with the place, there was also the calm consideration of a driver who knows the real business begins on Sunday.“It’s incredible,” he said. “This was still missing. The car felt good all weekend. I’m very happy about today but there’s still a race to do and that’s the most important.”He has every reason to be confident for the race as well, with two wins from three races and with the Red Bull displaying a remarkable turn of pace around a track which plays to their aerodynamic strengths. Verstappen clearly had the balance and stability required for the frequent direction changes at the Hungaroring and was able to exploit them.He did so with some style. He went quickest on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 14.958sec, almost two tenths clear of both Bottas in second and Hamilton in third. That was a mighty advantage to overcome but, much as Bottas tried, he could make little impression. Indeed Verstappen found even more on his second run. Pushing his Red Bull to the edge, he was on another level on his last lap, when he went almost half a second quicker with 1min 14.572sec. It was superb.Bottas followed him to within a hundredth but could not match him. Hamilton, despite looking strong this weekend, was almost two-tenths back.There were rightly celebrations at Red Bull for their first pole this season and with the engine manufacturer Honda, for whom it is a first pole since Jenson Button took the top spot at Australia in 2006.Hamilton was disappointed in being unable to challenge harder. “The car wasn’t the same as it was in third practice,” he said.“It was a bit of a struggle, just plateaued. It didn’t really get better. But we’re still in the fight, hopefully for the race we’ll have better race pace.”There were smiles, however, at the other end of the pitlane, as Williams turned in their best qualifying of the year. Having finally brought the aero upgrades they have been waiting for to Germany it paid off in Hungary, with George Russell in 16th. It was a superb run and the first time Williams have not been slowest on track in qualifying this year. Optimism that they can move closer to the midfield looks justified.Ferrari had expected to be under the cosh through the slow and medium-speed corners of the Hungaroring but Leclerc did not help their cause. He lost the rear, too hot into the final corner and spun into the wall in Q1, taking minor damage. Remarkably his car was still able to put in good times and he did well to take fourth.The day, however, belonged emphatically to Verstappen, continuing a strong and consistent opening to the season. He is third in the world championship, 63 points behind Hamilton and 21 in front of Vettel and there was optimism there would be more reasons for the Dutch fans to celebrate come Sunday.“We know that, if you can start upfront for the race, it makes it easier to control,” he said.“We have been working really hard to improve the engine in quali to get more out if it. That showed today. We keep improving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b449fcec3fb5b7b81f8f845596ddeba97cd50b8/191_0_2830_1698/master/2830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ed0dcf099797277516ddb3cbfc288b","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia first test day three live","story":"Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad gave England a useful lead of 90 at Edgbaston before the magnificent Steve Smith led a strong Australian fightback And here’s James Pattinson “We’d have taken this position at the start of the day. Now it’s about trying to bat all day tomorrow. We were a bit unlucky yesterday, but our plans were good, we executed well and we got our rewards today. Hats off to Rory Burns, who played fantastically.“You’ve got to make the most of the new ball before it starts getting a bit flat and a bit soft, especially on these dry wickets. It’s great to be back playing Test cricket in front of a really boisterous crowd.”Here’s Chris Woakes “We are pleased to have taken three wickets, although we probably leaked a few too many runs. You’d probably say we’re slightly ahead in the game. The fields weren’t overly attacking. We probably didn’t quite get our lengths right. That was another intriguing day’s play. The initiative changes hands a few times, and at the moment it’s in the twitching hands of Steve Smith. If England don’t get him before lunch, they will be in trouble. And if Smith makes two centuries to win a lowish-scoring Ashes Test, it will be a comeback for the ages.“I think the catch to Michael Collins’s perfectly sensible suggestion is that many folk like to have ‘a few’ drinks at the cricket whilst not getting totally ‘tanked up’ and spoiling other people’s enjoyment,” says Simon McMahon. “A three, sorry thirteen, sorry thirty-pint limit would work at most grounds, no?”That’s a bit rich coming from the man who’s been running round the Hollies Stand dressed as Bobby Charlton all afternoon.And like that, the day’s play is over. The crowd boo but it has become very dark at Edgbaston. Australia lead by 34 at the close crucially, Steve Smith is still at the crease. He has batted with awesome certainty.31st over: Australia 124-3 (Smith 46, Head 21) Smith drags a short ball from Stokes round the corner for four. Australia are scoring at more than four an over, a reflection of their intent and also some loose England bowling. They have really missed Jimmy Anderson - not just his wicket-taking threat but also his relentless accuracy.“Rob, I’m mortified!” says Emiel de Bont. “Ben Macintyre’s interruption surely qualifies as the first ever mention of avocado toast in the context of a cricket match. Wait till the Aussies catch on. They’ll be laughing themselves silly and believe England are toast now. Millennials...”30th over: Australia 119-3 (Smith 41, Head 21) A slick of luck for Head, who flashes Root over the left shoulder of Stokes at first slip and away for four. He nails the cut stroke next ball, timing it through backward point for four more. Australia lead by 29.“There is always an alcohol-free stand at the MCG which seems to work well,” says Julie Wilson. “Has the advantage of not so many people obscuring your view on their way to the bar.”29th over: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) Smith continues of course he does. A maiden from Stokes.“Rob,” says Romeo. “It’ll be interesting if they try and find a like-for-like concussion substitute for Smith.”‘The new Australian batsman, Virat Kohli...’28.2 overs: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) A bouncer from Stokes hits Smith flush in the grille. He staggers away towards silly point, just about staying on his feet, and there’s a break in play while he has a concussion test. He looks compos mentis, and I’m sure he’ll want to continue, but that little stagger away from the crease did not look good. He was very wobbly.28th over: Australia 111-3 (Smith 41, Head 13) Joe Root replaces Moeen Ali, nothing much happens. I really feel for Moeen. He seemed to have cracked it as a Test spinner after his recall last summer, but now he’s almost back where he was 18 months ago.“The answer to the problem caused by the tension that exists between those of us wanting to just watch the cricket and others just wanting to get tanked up and engage in hilarious (sic) banter is to have alcohol-free stands,” says Michael Collins. “Let those who enjoy beer snakes and yet-another-round-of-amusing-chanting all sit together and revel in each other’s witty company.”That’s an extremely persuasive idea. What’s the catch? 27th over: Australia 109-3 (Smith 40, Head 12) Smith survives a big LBW appeal from Stokes after getting in a bit of a tangle on the back foot. The ball hit him between the legs and was going over the top, though not by much. England didn’t review.“Those readers frustrated about the liveblog time stamps should consider themselves lucky to be only a few hours off,” says Mac Millings, “because here in South Carolina it appears to be the year 1953.”26th over: Australia 108-3 (Smith 40, Head 12) Smith laces Moeen emphatically through extra cover for four. What a brilliant stroke. It’s only his second boundary, yet he is still scoring at almost a run a ball. It’s the third day of the series and it already feels like he’s broken England’s will. I’m starting to think England should pick Jack Leach at Lord’s, partly because of Smith’s record against left-arm spin. When Moeen’s confidence goes, it goes quickly, and at the moment he is bowling in hope rather than expectation. Australia have gone after him, a sensible approach given his fragile confidence, and he has figures of 9-0-48-1. Australia lead by 18.25th over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 34, Head 10) Head survives a run-out chance off the first ball after drinks. He would have been miles out had Burns’ throw from short square-leg hit the stumps. Thanks, incidentally, for all your emails about the time zone problem. You’ll be pleased to know they’ve made things even muddier, because everyone’s case seems to be different. 24th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 33, Head 9) Jofra Archer is on the field as a substitute. It’ll be fascinating to see how he tries to get Steve Smith out when he makes his Test debut. Moeen has an LBW shout against Smith turned down by Aleem Dar. It was a dangerous delivery which turned sharply and kept low, but it hit Smith well outside the line of off stump.“Nick Barlow doesn’t speak for the silent majority but rather for the older contingent of cricket fans,” says Ben Macintyre. “Not saying alcohol is the answer to get young people into cricket, but I find it’s the same people who sit around harking for the days of tea and polite applause who also wonder why cricket fans aren’t getting younger and think that my generation (I’m 21) is lazy because we eat avocado on toast. Not everyone has to be a part of the Barmy Army the same way not everyone has to restrict themselves to tea and polite applause.”I’m staying out of this one.23rd over: Australia 94-3 (Smith 30, Head 8) Smith works a single off Stokes to put Australia in the lead. He is stockpiling runs, mainly ones and twos on the leg side, with intimidating ease. I say this genuinely, rather than in a half-arsed attempt to jinx Smith: I cannot see him getting out.“Neil Golightly (19th over) is quite wrong,” says Dan Jones. “My phone has never been out of the UK and it persists in showing the time in EDT (and indeed any other opponents’ time zone). I therefore believe this *is* a conspiracy to annoy Heather Bartlett.”And what about Heather Greenstreet? Or are they the same person? This is like a bloomin’ John le Carré book.22nd over: Australia 90-3 (Smith 27, Head 7) If Smith does have a weakness it’s against left-arm spin, which may influence England’s selection as the series develops, especially if he keeps scoring 150 in every innings. At the moment, absurd as it sounds, you’d probably back Jack Leach to get as many runs as Moeen Ali, never mind wickets. 21st over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 23, Head 5) In his last 10 Test innings against England, Steve Smith has a preposterous average of 142.28. If anyone in this side can rip him from his bubble it’s probably Stokes. But not in that over - five from it. 20th over: Australia 80-3 (Smith 20, Head 3) Moeen Ali replaces Joe Root, who replaced Moeen Ali for one over. Head flicks for three to get off the mark. Although he took the wicket of Bancroft, Moeen looks a bit low on confidence and has gone for 31 from six overs.“Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “I effing LOVE cricket. And the OBO. I’m not even drunk. Somethings just need saying sometimes.”You’re the one dressed as Bobby Charlton in the Hollies Stand, aren’t you? 19th over: Australia 75-3 (Smith 19, Head 0) Head is beaten first ball by another cracker from Stokes, who looks pretty fired up. A wicket maiden to start what, knowing Stokes, could be a long spell. “It doesn’t actually matter which edition of the website you’re reading, the timestamps will be displayed as local to whichever time zone your device is set to,” says Neil Golightly. “If you want BST, you’ll have to change your device settings.”I’ll level with you - I haven’t a clue how it works. But I do know it’s not a conspiracy to irritate Heather Greenstreet.Ben Stokes has made something happen! He’s dismissed Usman Khawaja second ball with a sizzling delivery that straightened sharply to cut him in half and shave the inside-edge on its way through to Bairstow. That’s a big wicket for England, and a classic bit of Stokesian partnership-breaking.18th over: Australia 75-2 (Khawaja 40, Smith 19) Joe Root turns to his second-change bowler, Joe Root. That’s an interesting move. It might just be a single over so that Moeen Ali can change ends. Nothing much happens, with each batsman taking a single. I think England need to bring Ben Stokes on and set him to make-things-happen mode.Here’s Philip Saunders. “Nick Barlow (15th over) speaks for the silent majority (pun intended!).”I completely understand that view. I think years of watching darts has17th over: Australia 73-2 (Khawaja 39, Smith 18) Struggling to replicate the adrenaline rush of the World Cup final? Fear not: England are on course to provide another nerve-shredding runchase either tomorrow or Monday.Khawaja drives Woakes crisply through backward point for four, another shot of unobtrusive excellence, and waves another boundary through mid-on later in the over. This is an excellent spell for Australia and it’s very quiet at Edgbaston. England need a wicket, or even a near miss to get the crowd going. 16th over: Australia 64-2 (Khawaja 31, Smith 17) “Hello Rob,” says Geoff Wignall. “Re: the England batting order, I know I’m not alone in fancying Stokes at four. The suggestion of Bairstow at five astonishes me. Over the last year or so, aside from his outlier ton at Columbo his Test match performances suggest nine or ten would be about right. And of course they should be picking the best keeper since Taylor in Foakes, who’s easily good enough to bat at seven.” You may fancy Stokes at No4 but he doesn’t – he asked to drop from five to six in the winter because he felt there was a hangover from his bowling and fielding. I agree that Bairstow has batted abysmally of late, but he’s a much better player than that. If he’s anywhere near his best I would bat him at No5, not that this is likely to happen. 15th over: Australia 61-2 (Khawaja 30, Smith 15) Khawaja, surprised by a bit of extra bounce from Woakes, does well to get over the ball and drop it on the off side. The next ball is too straight and flicked through midwicket for two by Khawaja. He’s playing beautifully. “Hiya Rob,” says Nick Barlow. “Just watching the game and am getting seriously fed up with the football-style chants and general foolishness. I realise the halcyon days of yore are rare these days with polite applause sustaining the audience while cups of tea are served, but if I wanted pillocks chanting I’d follow football. Can’t we just ban the Barmy Army and make them watch the game in pubs? Yes, I am fun at parties.”Is it actually the Barmy Army, though? I always assumed it was isolated groups of banterers. I don’t mind them, personally, if the jollity is coupled with an appreciation of decent cricket. The booing of Smith and Warner feels like wackiness for the sake of it, the kind of thing Colin Hunt would do. The drunken gaeity doesn’t bother me so much, though I probably wouldn’t be as equable if I was at the ground and had a fat bloke in a ballerina dress belching in my face every couple of overs.14th over: Australia 58-2 (Khawaja 28, Smith 14) Khawaja has stealthily moved to 28 from 30 balls and looks comfortable against Moeen, which hasn’t always been the case. This is really excellent stuff England lead by 32.“When,” says Gary Naylor, “do England start giving Smith the single?”13th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 12) Woakes replaces Broad, who bowled a slightly loose opening spell of 6-0-26-1. This is such an important spell, because if Smith gets in England are in trouble. Woakes hits him on the thigh or pad three times during a fine over all too high for LBW appeals, but challenging bowling nonetheless.“Remember,” says Glenn Brazier, “when our top four consisted of Tresco, Strauss, Vaughan and Thorpe? Insanity looking at today’s batting line-up.”I cannot tell you how much I loathe myself for what I’m about to do, but … they were never England’s top four. Thorpe batted at No5 in the twilight of his career. The pedant in me is caged by frail and fragile bars.12th over: Australia 52-2 (Khawaja 27, Smith 9) His batting may have gone to seed, but Moeen has been a matchwinner with the ball since his recall a year ago. He should be England’s biggest wicket-taking threat on this dusty surface. For now, though, England could use a maiden or two. Khawaja flicks four more to fine leg - both he and Smith are scoring at a run a ball or better.11th over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 21, Smith 9) Khawaja hits consecutive boundaries off Broad, a flick through midwicket followed by a shovel round the corner. Australia are scoring very freely just now, with 29 runs coming from the last four overs.“Nope I see EDT too, not just Heather Greenstreet,” says James Governor. “To be fair you had weird time zones throughout the World Cup too.”Are you sure you’re reading the UK edition? It’s fine on my browser. I’ll ask the desk about it.10th over: Australia 33-2 (Khawaja 12, Smith 5) Khawaja is dropped! It was a very sharp, low chance to Buttler in the gully off the bowling of Moeen he couldn’t get his hands down fast enough and the ball ran through his legs. Smith then gets his first boundary with a classy flick behind square. He looks in ominous touch. He’s faced four balls.“Wonderful Test cricket we are witnessing,” says Sam. “Though not cricket, and to reverse the confusion back across the Atlantic, when I was around ten I believed that if you turned a baseball diamond into a straight line it would be a mile long. What incredible athletes they must be.”Cameron Bancroft is put out of his misery by Moeen Ali. He shaped to come down the track, changed his mind and gave a simple bat-pad catch to short leg. It was good bowling from Moeen, who saw Bancroft coming and fired the ball flatter and straighter. Bancroft, in a bit of a tangle, could only deflect it onto the pad and into the hands of Jos Buttler.9th over: Australia 27-1 (Bancroft 7, Khawaja 11) Bancroft is beaten, chasing a length outswinger from Broad. I’m not sure England have made him play enough when he does, he looks vulnerable. At the other end, Khawaja looks calmer and more secure.“Sir, if you do have a change take a glance at the Windies score in their T20I v India being played at Miami,” says Abhijato Sensarma. “Debutant teenager Saini took two consecutive wickets in his first over. They’re 435 as I write this ... Some scenes, and some talent on display!”Truly, you can never have enough scenes. If anything can save this world gone wrong, it will surely be scenes.This isn’t the only live sport today. “It’s not going so well for England at Woburn,” says golfblog genius Scott T Murray, “as birdie putt after birdie putt fails to drop for Georgia Hall, Charley Hull and Bronte Law.”8th over: Australia 26-1 (Bancroft 6, Khawaja 11) Moeen Ali does come into the attack. His second ball, to Bancroft, is an absolute jaffa that roars through the gate and just misses the off stump. Khawaja then edges wide of slip for four. Nine from the over but that was a promising start from Moeen.“Sat at Mombasa airport,” says Mike Harding. “I have got your commentary in one ear of the Test match and watching a live stream of my club Wilmslow Cc playing Woodford CC in Cheshire. It is tea at Edgbaston and tea at the Rectory Field Wilmslow. The wonder of the internet.”I especially love that it enables you to hear the written word. 7th over: Australia 17-1 (Bancroft 6, Khawaja 3) Joe Root must be tempted to have an early look at Moeen Ali against Khawaja, although Broad and Woakes are bowling well. Bancroft edges a good delivery from Broad along the floor to third slip before flicking a single to long leg.“On Curran, and this is meant seriously, not provocatively!” begins Andrew Hurley. “Who would you fancy to get more runs, he or Denly?”I know what you mean, but I don’t think Curran is ready to bat No4 against Australia. And Jos Buttler certainly isn’t. It wouldn’t surprise me if, come the winter, Jason Roy bats at No4 and Rory Burns opens with somebody else.6th over: Australia 15-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 2) Bancroft is beaten, fencing away from his body at Woakes. This is a million miles from the hord and forst wickets he bats on in Perth, and you can see how desperate he is just to get through this new-ball spell. “Faced with a dilemma,” says Colum Fordham. “Whether to watch the fascinating prospect of Broad and Woakes trying to dismiss the Australian batsmen or go out and get a bit of net practice with Sri Lankans in makeshift nets created on a former 5-a side football pitch surrounded by brambles (good blackberries by the way). Part of me says that I’m crazy even to contemplate the latter option. I suppose I can always follow the  OBO while in the scorching afternoon heat of Naples wondering why I made the wrong decision.”Do as I say, not as I would do: go and play cricket.5th over: Australia 14-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 1) England would love to get Steve Smith in against the new ball. Broad strays onto the pads of Khawaja, who flicks a single to get off the mark. Nothing else to report from a pretty quiet over. “You are a UK paper,” says Heather Greenstreet. “We are UK listeners. Match is being played in the UK. PLEASE use BST.”Listen, we are using BST. I suspect you’re reading the US edition. 4th over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 0) Woakes keeps the pressure on with a maiden to Bancroft. That’s only the third time in Warner’s Test career, and the first against England, that he has been out in single figures in both innings.3rd over: Australia 13-1 (Bancroft 5, Khawaja 0) That’s a huge wicket. Warner has started busily and had hit Broad for two fours earlier in the over.“Afternoon Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “Can I be the first to predict that rarest of outcomes, a draw? Australia, after a Smith double hundred, set England 401 to win, which they politely decline to attempt, and a fifth day filled with obdurate blocking, Mexican waves, streakers, and elderly members failing to stay awake.”That’s Stuart Broad’s 450th Test wicket. It was a mighty delivery that lifted and straightened dramatically from around the wicket Warner tried to leave at the last minute but was too late and the ball kissed the edge on its wasy through to Bairstow. The not-out decision looks a bit of a shocker from Joel Wilson, because there was a fairly big deflection, but in his defence Broad also wasn’t sure.I think this out, purely because Warner’s head snapped round the moment the ball went past the bat.2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Bancroft 5, Warner 0) James Anderson is off the field, so Chris Woakes will share the new ball. After a good start, he ends the over with a dreadful delivery on leg stump that Bancroft flicks through midwicket for four.“I suggested to the OBO last year that perhaps Bairstow could keep for one of the innings, depending on the toss and Buttler (or Foakes or Burns) keep for the other,” says Mark Slater. “That way you can have him bat at No5, and pander to his preference.”I think his preference is to bat No7 and keep. Either way, I’m not sure Test cricket is ready for such funky tactics just yet.1st over: Australia 1-0 (Bancroft 1, Warner 0) A superb start to the innings from Stuart Broad. Bancroft survives a big LBW appeal (too high), is beaten outside off and takes a quick single to get down the other end.“Remember when Dominic Cork made a half century at the Oval in 2002?” says Chris Fryer. “He held up seven defiant fingers to show he was up to batting that high in the order. England made 515, so it might have been a bit of a flat track.”That went well it was his last Test innings.“When we were kids,” says Paul Metcalfe, “big brother Andy had us all convinced that there was a rule called ‘Last Man Stands’ whereby the eleventh batsman could, in special circumstances, soldier on alone. I’ve never been sure whether he actually believed it himself.” “Nice to see a TV sports producer with a sense of mischief,” says Ian Copestake. “Warne comes on commentary and the camera switches to Steve Waugh. Silence ensues.”The innings break means the players will take an early tea. There are still 44 overs remaining, so the evening session could be a cracker. Although he batted, I don’t think Anderson is fit enough to bowl. We’ll soon find out.The third bowling change in as many overs. Lyon replaces Pattinson who replaced Cummins who replaced Lyon - and the move has the desired effect when Anderson slog-sweeps straight up in the air. That’s Lyon’s third wicket, all left-handers of course. Chris Woakes is left unbeaten on 37, and England lead by 90."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a117f1fc12d954021d0ae98505a6c1b01207ce5/0_81_2824_1695/master/2824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8baee6ccd0fbf23ca4ddce5418ace9","title":"golf womens british open 2019 third round live","story":"A wee spot of bother for Charley Hull at 18, as she drives into the bunker to the left of the fairway. She lashes a fine second towards the back of the green, just off. But her putt from the fringe stops six feet short. This is a huge par putt coming up. After her sensational back-nine surge, will she lose a little momentum at the very end?Ariya Jutanugarn’s hopes of winning a second British Open at Woburn look remote now, after a round that unfurled with bogeys at 13, 16 and 18. She ended up with a 72, slipping from a high of -9 to -6. Ashleigh Buhai is also threatening to unravel. Her five-stroke lead having been whittled down to one, she carves an iron from the centre of the fairway at 16 into thick rough to the right of the green. The ball nearly topples into the bunker, but sticks near the lip. She’d have liked to have seen that fall in. She made a huge up and down at 14 what she’d pay in cash money for another one here.Neither Buhai nor Shibuno reach the 15th green in two. But both fizz glorious wedges towards the pin. Buhai leaves herself a six-footer for birdie, Shibuno is perhaps six inches inside. Buhai prods in rather fidgety fashion at her effort, which squirts off to the right. Just a par. But Shibuno makes her birdie! Suddenly she’s just one shot off the lead, and the Smiling Cinderella is having a ball. This is a fantastic leaderboard!Park Sung-hyun bashes a 300-yard drive down 16. A wedge pin high, leaving a straight 18-footer across the green for a birdie that’d take her to within one shot of Ashleigh Buhai. One more joule of energy, and she’d make it. She remains -11. Up on 18, a 74 for Georgia Hall, and at -4 her grip on the title is all but loosened.Birdie putts for both Bronte Law and Lizette Salas on the par-five 15th. Neither can make theirs. They both remain at -9. Back down the fairway, the final pairing of Hinako Shibuno and Ashleigh Buhai wait for the green to clear after clattering big drives down the track.Ko Jin-young nearly curls in a 30-foot birdie putt from the back of 18. But that’s par, and a 68 that springs her up the leaderboard to -10. Her bid to become only the fourth player to win three majors in a year, after Ben Hogan, Tiger Woods and Inbee Park, is still on. Meanwhile Ciganda takes two putts for a closing double bogey. A farcical end to an otherwise fine round of golf. A third 69 of the week, but it should have been so much better.Hinako Shibuno’s recovery continues apace! Her tee shot at 14 was delicious, over the flag to 12 feet. And in goes the birdie putt! She’s -11. She closes further on Ashleigh Buhai, who clips a delightful sand shot to three feet, and saves her par. That showed such moxie in the circumstances. A third consecutive birdie would have really meddled with her mind. But as things stand she’s still got a two-shot lead at the top. She’s -13, two clear of Carlota Ciganda, who won’t be staying at -11 very much longer. But Park Sung-hyun will be there. She nearly drains a monster eagle putt, but a third birdie in four holes will do. She’s -11.Ashleigh Buhai is rocking. She pulls her hybrid at the par-three 14th into a deep bunker on the left. She looks really flustered at the minute. What she’d give for a ship-steadying sandy save. But she doesn’t have a lot of green to play with. And she’s not the only one in trouble. Second-placed Carlota Ciganda slices her tee shot at 18 into the bushes down the right. She should take an unplayable, but attempts to hack it out instead. She’s got hardly any backswing, and can’t punch her ball out. Now she takes an unplayable. So she’s hitting four into the green. She finds the putting surface, but it’ll be a long two putts for double bogey.Ashleigh Buhai was five shots clear of the field not so long ago. But now her lead is just two. She faces a slippery downhill chip from the side of 13, and sends a lovely soft-handed effort rolling slowly towards the hole. But the green is fast, and her ball ends eight feet past the cup. She pulls the one coming back uphill, and this championship is suddenly on. And there’s a fourth birdie in five holes for Charley Hull, this time at 15. She looked way out of this, but one back-nine charge later, and she’s only four off the lead! She’s soon joined by Bronte Law, who finally makes a birdie putt, draining one across 14. They’re both at -9.Ko’s tee shot at 17 is straight at the flag. But 20 feet short. She very nearly makes the right-to-left curler for another birdie, but fails to give it enough juice. A tap-in for par. Ciganda misses a birdie putt from half the distance, failing to set it far enough out to the right. Meanwhile the US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 signs for a blemish-free 69 featuring birdies at 2, 10 and 17. She’s nicely placed at -8.The world number one Ko Jin-young nearly finds a bunker to the side of the 16th green. But her ball snags on the bank, and she pops a wedge up onto the green. The ball twangs off the flagstick and drops! Her first birdie on the back nine. She joins the group at -10. Par for her partner Carlota Ciganda. If Ashleigh Buhai stumbles on the way home - and she looks a little concerned as she misses to the right of 13 - this is wide open.Hinako Shibuno is back in business! Her mood lifted, she wedges to ten feet at 12, trots elegantly after the ot, replaces it with a smile, then makes the putt to move to -10. And suddenly she’s only four off the top, because Ashleigh Buhai makes her first error since the 11th on Thursday. She trundles a 30-foot birdie putt six feet past, and shoves the one coming back. Only her second bogey of the week, and suddenly the lead is back to just three. No fourth birdie in a row for Hull, sadly, as she sends her curling putt too far out to the right.Park Sung-hyun took a while to get going. But suddenly she’s made back-to-back birdies, firing an iron straight at the flag on 13 and rolling in the 20-foot right-to-left slider. She’s suddenly -10. Celine Boutier birdies the hole too, and she’s -9 And this is beginning to cook up nicely, because Charley Hull has just lashed a majestic long iron towards the pin at the long par-three 14th. An eight feet putt for a fourth birdie in a row!Three birdies in a row for Charley Hull! The latest at 13. She’s been bang on it since the turn. She’s -8, alongside Bronte Law who misses yet another short-range birdie putt, this time at 12. Her game has been in fine nick today, but her putter’s stone cold. One of those days.Morgan Pressel finishes her round with four birdies in the last five holes! She creams her second at 18 to four feet, and deservedly makes it three in a row. She’s back in 32, and it’s a round of 66! She allows herself a quiet, satisfied smile. The new clubhouse leader. Back-to-back birdies for Lizette Salas, incidentally, at 10 and 11, as she reinserts herself into the story.Park Sung-hyun has been extremely quiet today. Just the one birdie up until now, at 4. But now the recently deposed world number one goes for the green at the short par-four 12th. She finds a bunker, but splashes out to five feet and makes her second birdie of the day. She’s moved stealthily into the group at -9.Another birdie for Charley Hull! This one comes at 12, and she’s -7 again. Back where she started, after those front-nine bogeys at 2 and 8. And there’s more belated good news for English fans, as Bronte Law - who had missed a short birdie putt on 10 and stormed off absolutely fuming - finally makes one at the par-five 11th. She raises both arms in ironic celebration, and this time she walks off smiling and laughing. She’s -8 and far from out of this ... providing Ashleigh Buhai gives some succour to the field. Which at the moment looks far from likely.Ashleigh Buhai just keeps on trucking! Her approach into 10 isn’t particularly close, but her flat stick is red hot, and she guides in a right-to-left slider for another birdie. There’s a much-needed birdie for her partner Hinako Shibuno, who hasn’t cracked her trademark smile for some time. For a second, it looks as though she’s not going to respond to this boost, ground down by her earlier misfires. But she can’t help herself. A smile plays around the side of her mouth. The professional within tries to fight it, but eventually she gives in, letting it spread across her face. The gallery respond to her infectious joy. Welcome back, Smiling Cinderella, we’ve missed you.You’ll have noticed Morgan Pressel creeping onto the bottom of the leaderboard. Well, she hasn’t stopped there! The Floridian made her name as the 18-year-old winner of the ANA Inspiration back in 2007, in those pre-Lydia-Ko days becoming the youngest-ever women’s major champion. Now 31, she’s looking to banish the ghosts of 2013, when she led this event at St Andrews after 54 holes, only to shoot a final round of 76. Out in 34 today, she’s just birdied 14, 16 and now 17, the latest deserved reward for a lovely iron landed softly to the right of the pin at the par-three, her ball gathering round to 12 feet. She’s right in the mix now!Jung Yan pars the last for her 67. She’s the new clubhouse leader at -8. In the meantime, Charley Hull makes her first birdie of the day, raking in a long birdie putt across 12. She’s back to -6, and the crowd give her an encouraging roar. But it’s a poor three-putt bogey for Hinako Shibuno on 9. She turns in 37, head bowed, the effervescent figure of yesterday afternoon a distant memory right now. She slips to -8. A fairytale win for the Smiling Cinderella will soon become a pipe dream if she doesn’t rediscover her mojo soon. The 20-year-old debutant looks extremely deflated. It’s a real shame.Bounce-back birdie for Carlota Ciganda! She responds to that yip on 11 with two careful, easy irons down 12. In goes the 12-footer, and the lead at the top is cut to four. Par for her partner Ko Jin-young. Another birdie Jing Yan, meanwhile, at the par-three 17th. If she makes it up the last without dropping a shot, the 33-year-old from China will be signing for a 67.A miserable and frustrating end to Anna Nordqvist’s excellent round. She sends her second at 18 bounding towards the flag. It nearly clatters the stick, in which case she could be waltzing off the green with an outrageous eagle. But the ball misses and topples off the back. A hot putt from the fringe ends eight feet past the hole, and the par saver coming back lips out. That’s still a marvellous 68, but every shot counts with Ashleigh Buhai romping away at the top, and she walks off looking as disappointed as you’d imagine. She’s the new clubhouse leader at -7.Ko Jin-young looks to have made a right-to-left 20-footer on 11 for birdie. The ball’s heading for the hole, dead on line. But then gravity does a number on her, the ball somehow riding the wall of death, making a u-turn around the back of the cup, stubbornly refusing to drop, then sitting up on the lip. That’s outrageous. So unlucky for the ANA and Evian champ. She remains at -9, now alongside Caroline Masson, who birdies 10 with a celebratory air punch, and Carlota Ciganda, who bogeys 11 after yipping a short par putt. Ashleigh Buhai now has a five-shot lead! It was nearly six, but she lets a 12-foot birdie putt on 8 tail off to the right.A beauty sent into the par-three 8th by Bronte Law. Her ball bounces up the green, resting pin high, 12 feet to the left of the flag. But her birdie effort is never going in, always heading right the second it leaves the face of the putter. Extreme frustration for Law, who shakes her head in bewilderment. That wasn’t a confident stroke. She stays at -7, just off the pace. She’s joined there by her partner Lizette Salas, who went long and left with her tee shot and couldn’t get up and down.The Smiling Cinderella looks a little down on herself right now. The sensational approaches aren’t going quite so close today. Shibuno’s 15 feet from the flag at the par-five 7th, but the birdie putt doesn’t drop. But her playing partner Ashleigh Buhai rolls in another fine putt from similar distance. Birdie. She looks so cool right now, so calm, it’ll send a chill through the rest of the field.We have a new clubhouse leader in Sakura Yokomine. The 33-year-old from Japan doesn’t have a stellar record in the majors - top-ten finishes at the US Open in 2010 and 2014, and that’s it - but a 67 today has propelled her up to -6. Meanwhile on 10, the 2016 champ Ariya Jutanugarn sends a wedge over the flag at 10, nearly spinning it back into the cup for eagle. The ball rolls a further couple of feet past, but that’s another birdie and she’s -9. And bogey for Celine Boutier at 8, a short putt pushed right of the cup. She’s back to -7.It’s beginning to look as though any faint hope of a home victory will be down to Bronte Law. She’s level par through 6, and remains at -7. But hot on the heels of Georgia Hall’s double at 9 comes bogey at 8 for Charley Hull, who slips to -5 as well. Hall and Hull have eight shots to make up on Ashleigh Buhai, a player who so far has dropped one shot all week.A lovely tee shot into 6 by the leader Ashleigh Buhai. Pin high, 12 feet to the left. She’s a bit tentative with the birdie putt, though, and it dies off to the left. A good chance to extend her healthy lead at the top even further goes by the wayside. Meanwhile we were spared the sight of Georgia Hall’s head poking out the top of the wild nonsense she drove into. But we do witness the misery of double bogey. She clatters down the standings to -5, and the chance of her becoming the first player since Yani Tseng in 2011 to retain the British Open may have just gone, right there. Bother here for the defending champion Georgia Hall. She sends a hook towards the gallery down the left of 9. It clears the punters, bounces on a path, and disappears into waist-high vegetation. That’s some mutant cabbage. Meanwhile the smile still hasn’t returned to Hinako Shibuno’s face: an underhit chip from the side of 5 leads to her first bogey since the 4th yesterday. Here’s the latest leaderboard, now featuring no English players at all.Ariya Jutanugarn isn’t far from eagle at 7. But birdie will suffice. She joins the group at -8. Lizette Salas repairs the damage of 3 with birdie at 5. She’s -8 again. Caroline Masson rolls in a 25-foot birdie putt on 5, and she’s back to -8 too. And Charley Hull pulls a eight-footer for birdie at 8. The home charge is stalling on the easier front nine.England’s dreaming as Bronte Law and Georgia Hall line up birdie putts. Law first. She’d sent her second at 5 over the flag, leaving a relatively straight 12 footer coming back. But she underhits it, the ball dying to the left and stopping one dimple short. Georgia Hall meanwhile clips her tee shot at 8 to eight feet ... but she underhits her putt too, her effort dying right. Both players take turns to look pained, a little bit of frustration creeping in.Back-to-back birdies for Ko Jin-young! A tee shot at 8 to 15 feet, and a putt guided nervelessly into the hole. Back-to-back majors as well? You wouldn’t bet too much money against it. Meanwhile they call Hinako Shibuno “Smiling Cinderella” back home in Japan, her sunny demeanour beloved by fans. She’s not smiling right now, though, a lesser-spotted cloud of misery gently hovering over her head after she sent a sensational approach at 4 to six feet, only to misread the right-to-left break on the birdie putt. I doubt she’ll wallow for too long.Another long putt at 7. It’s sunk by Carlota Ciganda’s playing partner Ko Jin-young from 25 feet for birdie. The world number one rises to -8. Meanwhile China’s Jing Yan is going along very nicely: birdies at 3, 6, 8 and now 11, and she’s -7. Yan, Ciganda and Nordqvist are showing that it’s possible to score low today. The English charge isn’t going to plan, though. Only Georgia Hall is under par for her round at the moment, with birdie at 2 her only prize through the first seven holes. She’s -7, as is Bronte Law, who has parred the opening three. And Charley Hull is still one over for her round, -6 overall through six.Scrub “ever-expanding” from that last entry, will you? Masson hits a second poor approach in a row, this time at 5. Her ball apologetically squeaks onto the front of the green, but well away from the flag. She leaves the first putt well short, then pulls the par saver. Bogey. Meanwhile Ciganda finds the par-five 7th in two, then curls in a 40-foot right-to-left breaker for eagle! Ciganda’s been in the mix so often at the majors in recent times. She may be due one. This could be it! Shibuno can’t make her birdie putt on 3, meanwhile, so she’s now got company in second spot.It’s easy to forget that Hinako Shibuno is playing in her first major championship this week. The 20-year-old Japanese sensation makes it all look so simple. She gently swishes a 6-iron pin high at 3. She’ll have another look at birdie, this time from 15 feet. Meanwhile a first birdie of Park Sung-hyun’s round, the reward for an approach to three feet at 4. She joins the ever-expanding group at -8.A three-putt bogey for Salas at 3. Maybe not technically, the first was from the fringe at the back, but you get the gist. She slips to -7, and her four-birdie blitz at the start of yesterday’s round seems an awfully long time ago. Moving the other way: Celine Boutier, who birdies 4 and joins the group at -8."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1f452c179aa7442fd02dec72eafd12c90df36e/184_247_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2474779018c21b5c24a64341172a19","title":"edinburgh fringe festival brexit politics standup comedy divided","story":"“How many of you here voted Leave?” wondered the Scottish comedian Mark Nelson of the crowd watching his new Edinburgh fringe show, Brexit Wounds. It is dangerous territory and only one man in the audience tentatively raised a hand. “So, are you happy now?” Nelson asked caustically.This year’s month-long festival is set to play out against a fast-changing political backdrop in Westminster and Holyrood, and many of the topical standup acts that dominate the fringe will struggle to keep up.Alongside Nelson, who professes bewilderment about how “the worst qualified man ever” has suddenly become prime minister, the award-winning political comic Matt Forde has brought up his show, Brexit, Pursued by a Bear, while for the first time the radio broadcaster Iain Dale will be hosting a succession of evenings with guests including Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, the Liberal leader Jo Swinson and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London.The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, is to appear in a show called Speaking Out Al Murray’s pub landlord will be parodying the nostalgic urge to recreate an imagined country of the past while the standup Phil Nichol is promising to give in to despair in his show Too Much.Leading impressionists Ronni Ancona and Lewis MacLeod have opted to tackle Melania and Donald Trump in their new show, Just Checking In, but inside many of the pop-up venues that fan out around the city’s Royal Mile during the festival the strain of reacting quickly to Britain’s isive leadership contest is almost audible.At a gala opening for the Assembly group of venues, the fringe impresario William Burdett-Coutts spoke of the need for the official arts festival and the fringe to project an image of Britain as a welcoming place in the face of anti-immigrant feeling. “At a time like this, that is a particularly important message,” he said.But should an arts festival really have a political position? Even leftwing performers in Edinburgh seem unsure what the best response to current affairs should be. Some feel that making Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP, and Boris Johnson into figures of fun has backfired.For Kieran Hodgson, who will be bringing his series of acclaimed one-man shows to the fringe, including one about the roots of Brexit in 1970s politics, it is a potentially perilous path. “I am not sure how effective it is. It seems as if the recent history of comics making joke after joke about Farage may actually have helped him to get across the idea that the whole of the British establishment was against him,” said Hodgson.“It don’t feel it would be genuine for me to put out a more passionate personal line on my own politics because I’d be thinking all the while to myself that I was probably wrong. That’s just my nature, so rather than fight it, I try to embrace the whole European question and say things that I can actually back up. At the same time I certainly don’t want to make light of things that are happening.”Other young performers at the festival have deliberately made the choice to “stay silly”, in spite of their political feelings. “We don’t want to audiences to have to rock back and forth worrying about what is happening,” said Marina Bye, who co-stars with her sister Maddy in the Underbelly sketch show they have written together, The Siblinging.“We have our opinions, of course, and we don’t want to seem as if we don’t care, but we see ourselves as offering a little bit of an escape and ease. At least, that is what we have deliberately set out to do.”And the Bye sisters have reason to understand how powerful comedy can be when used as a tool for changing perceptions. Their mother is Ruby Wax, whose television interviews with Imelda Marcos and Sarah Ferguson did much to shape the image of these controversial public figures in the 1990s.“We might well wonder why we’re going to a comedy festival while all this is happening in the world,” said elder sister Maddy. “But there are already a lot of Trump shows and Brexit musicals, and we have made a conscious decision not to write about it. Although it’s true that whenever there is a party, or we go for drinks at someone’s house, everyone ends up talking about politics now. It is sort of amazing that’s happened. You can see the interest in the number of shows up here about it all.”Another child of a famous parent who is taking a stand against political content this year is fringe debutante Grace Campbell, whose father, Alastair, was Tony Blair’s communications adviser. She is performing her show Why I’m Never Going into Politics throughout the month, in which she explains that growing up with a dad inside No 10 has given her a basinful of it.Early this summer the Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, a regular panellist on the BBC satirical quiz show Have I Got News for You, pushed back at the suggestion the programme was to blame for Johnson’s rise because it had welcomed him as a guest. “You voted for him!” Hislop said to the studio audience. Last week Hislop proved his satirical muscles are still flexing in a column in the New Statesman that called on Britain’s comedians to be more optimistic about prospects for mirth in a Johnson era, aping the prime minister’s own bouncy anti-doom rhetoric.“Hislop is great because he doesn’t accept received ideas and he hates a consensus,” said Hodgson. “But a lot of my audience will be Remainers, and I still want them to question or develop their ideas. Or at least to see everything is always muddy.” He suspects he is too “desperate to be liked” to write an overtly political show. “I want it to be a happy place for people. Also, I take a long time to write, and to be topical you would have to change your show on an afternoon’s notice.”What does disturb Hodgson, however, is the growing dislike of experts. “It is a strange phenomenon. It gives you a sense of vertigo.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What is it about malts, bourbons and blends that inspires such dedication?Few drinks inspire the way whisky does. Proud Scottish writer and raconteur Compton Mackenzie declared: “Love makes the world go round? Not at all. Whisky makes it go round twice as fast.” And Irish playwright and activist George Bernard Shaw romantically described whisky as “liquid sunshine”.While it’s easy to conjure the image of the spirit being swilled by middle-aged men wearing tweed the truth is that whisky’s appeal knows no boundaries. It’s been the go-to drink of celebrities (as well as politicians) for decades. Everyone from Kate Moss - who once threw a Burns Night party in a hotel that stocks 1,000 bottles - to Hollywood royalty such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, to Margaret Thatcher, have been keen fans … and they know it’s much more than just a drink. Tobermory whisky holds true to that philosophy. Born and distilled on the Isle of Mull, it’s a homage to the rich palate of its Hebridean home, where creativity and nature exist side by side.Tobermory’s spirit is rich with character and culture, like some of history’s most expressive whisky-lovers. Here’s what they have to say about one of life’s finest pleasures.Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra enjoyed a whisky on stage during his shows - so much so he was even buried with a bottle in 1998. He famously said: “Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.”It’s no wonder his second wife, Ava Gardner, loved it too. She once said: “I wish to live to 150 years old, but the day I die, I wish it to be with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of whiskey in the other.”According to some – although this is much contested – Humphrey Bogart’s last words were: “I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.”Winston Churchill drank a whisky and soda every day at 11am. During the war in India, he said: “The water was not fit to drink. To make it palatable, we had to add whisky. By diligent effort, I learned to like it.”Margaret Thatcher also enjoyed whisky and soda, believing it gave her strength. “You must have whisky to give you energy,” she said.Carry On legend Sid James kept bottles to hand on set, after quickly learning he got sent freebies if he could sneak them into shot. Shortly after James’s death, Les Dawson was in the dressing room of the theatre where James had collapsed when he saw a ghostly apparition – and the room began to smell of whisky.Fancying a lifestyle change, their pal Tommy Cooper once joked: “I’m on a whisky diet. I’ve lost three days already.”Mark Twain, author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was also in the “less is more” camp – until it came to the spirit. “Too much of anything is bad,” he declared, “but too much good whiskey is barely enough.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f0fa2b4ea4e1c3f98d062934e95a3b9240e4a1f/1183_815_2317_1390/master/2317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c656fa89cbc6456eb98133f24c8606","title":"offsetting carbon emissions how to travel options","story":"More and more people are trying to offset their travel emissions – so why isn’t it straightforward? We explain the options and how to navigate themHere’s the problem: in two months’ time I must travel to Malawi in southern Africa to help Gumbi Education, a small, -led kids’ education charity that I chair. There’s no Skype option, no railways or boats, and travelling 3,000 miles across Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania by bus is not recommended.I’ve cut my annual holiday flights, I’ve reduced my work travel, and my carbon footprint is nothing to what it was. But realistically, I must fly the 10,200 miles to and from Lilongwe – and I want to offset my emissions in some way. If done correctly, this should mean that I do less harm overall.But what I thought would be easy to arrange has proved a minefield. There is no agreement on how much carbon dioxide a journey may emit, confusion about what actions best reduce emissions, a huge choice of where to direct your money, and growing cynicism as airlines, airports and giant carbon-greedy corporations use offsetting to sell more flights or get permission to grow even further.A decade ago, the voluntary carbon offset market was tiny, unsophisticated and largely unregulated. The little money raised was aimed at worthwhile projects, but few schemes to cut emissions or promote development were verified or certified. Exposés, the financial crash and painfully slow progress in the UN climate talks all helped discourage iniduals and companies from offsetting.But as awareness of the climate crisis has grown, corporates in particular have turned to voluntary offsetting and sent the market mainstream. Small companies have been weeded out, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been set up, and thousands of participating companies and charities are now theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers.As the climate emergency grows, so too does the money involved – and the need for accountability.Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. One tonne of carbon is usually the equivalent of one credit and the market for these credits, worth possibly a few tens of millions of dollars in 2007, is now valued at over $500m a year and growing fast.This is equivalent to more than all of Australia’s energy-related emissions in 2016, according to Forest Trends, a New York-based conservation finance company that tracks carbon offset projects. The company’s report, Voluntary Carbon Markets Insights, says: “Demand for voluntary carbon offsets has grown … from just 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008 to 42.8 million tonnes in 2018.”Sarah Leugers, communications director of the Geneva-based nonprofit Gold Standard, which was set up by environment group WWF, says that – paradoxically – Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement transformed the market, with companies and iniduals all now wanting to do the right thing in contrast.As the market matures, so the choice of ways to offset emissions increases. You can now offset rail, road and air journeys, your stay in a holiday hotel, your daily commute, your home heating – indeed you could offset the emissions of your whole life.You could have a forest of banana trees or avocados planted in Kenya, reduce the amount of methane emitted from an Indonesian waste dump, provide fresh water to Malawians, rewild Romania or reforest areas of the Amazon basin home to communities of indigenous peoples.Today, the big offset certifiers such as American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra offer many hundreds of projects. To make it even more complex, the carbon price of these projects depends on where they are and the benefits they offer. Standards of verification also vary but in general are considered to be much tighter in Europe than the US.The problem is knowing what is best. Tree planting is theoretically highly effective but some offset schemes have attracted criticism for displacing people or creating monocultures wind and solar power projects are usually widely welcomed on a community level capturing methane gas from waste tips and landfill sites makes total sense but is hardly attractive and energy efficiency works best with the profligate rich. All schemes have pluses and minuses.“Offsetting must go hand in hand with an ambitious internal reduction strategy,” says Leugers. “The first priority should always be to reduce your own footprint before offsetting, but the reality is that not every inidual or business can do that quickly.“Business is putting in more money, but the number of people acting inidually is growing significantly. We have 1,500 projects in the pipeline. We don’t choose them NGOs come to us. They are all independently verified. The best advice I can give is to always look for the underlying standards.”Robert Stevens of Climate Care agrees: “Until we reach a zero-carbon world … paying to reduce an equivalent amount of carbon emissions through voluntary offsetting is the most cost-effective, quickest and efficient way of doing this.” But even trying to establish how much you emit on a journey is hard. Some offsetters take into account the extra impact of flying at an altitude above 35,000 feet others look at the age of the aircraft type you are likely to fly in, whether you travel business class, any stop-off points and how full the plane is likely to be. As the market grows, it throws up anomalies and prompts accusations that it legitimises the growth of emissions. Twenty-nine of the most fuel-profligate airlines, including Emirates, Delta, BA, Air Canada and Gulf, now offer to offset their customers’ flights, and 15 airlines now voluntarily offset their own emissions in some capacity.This allows Heathrow – which hopes that with a third runway it will be able to take an extra 265,000 flights a year – to say that it plans to use offsets to make it “carbon neutral” by 2030 and to be “zero-carbon” by 2050, even though it will build one of the world’s largest car parks and directly increase global emissions by millions of tonnes of CO2.This is wholly disingenuous, says Green MP Caroline Lucas, who describes Heathrow as “taking economy with the truth to new levels”.But there’s no doubt that companies, iniduals, nonprofit groups, even cities are now using offsets to go “carbon-neutral” or even “zero carbon”. Liverpool is working with Malta-based blockchain nonprofit Poseidon to offset emissions with projects in Africa and brands such as Disney, Microsoft, Lyft, Apple, Aviva and Sony have pledged to use offsets to become climate neutral.The bottom line is that to offset emissions, it is now possible to pay almost what you want to whom you want (though it is surprisingly difficult to calculate cruise ship emissions). The key to gauging the large-scale projects favoured by companies is to ascertain that they are real, measurable, independently verified and permanent, and would not have taken place without the finance provided by the sale of credits.Ideally, say observers, travellers should check to see whether they offer verified emission reduction (VER) credits, as offered by Gold Standard.The other approach is to use DIY offsets. This involves working out your emissions using an online calculator (see calculator tool above), then finding a project that roughly compensates (for example Gold Standard). Or you could just donate to an organisation working to suck up carbon or generate renewable energy. Many admirable environmental projects run by small energy and conservation groups do excellent work on tree planting and clean energy without always offering credits – just contributing would effectively help offset emissions. Forests Without Frontiers in Romania, Tree Aid and the Woodland Trust are personal favourites.Offsetting can work, and it allows people who have to travel to do so with a clearer conscience. But the best strategy must be to reduce your own emissions first.For his 10,200-mile round London to Lilongwe round-trip via Nairobi, John asked eight offsetting companies to calculate his CO2 emissions, how much they would cost to offset, and where the money goes.

The messages contained a slew of homophobic and misogynistic language directed at political rivals and cultural figures. They also contained a joke about dead bodies after Hurricane Maria, which tore through the island in September 2017 and killed thousands of island residents.Initially, there was jubilation over the success of the popular movement to force Rosselló out of office. But on Friday, Puerto Ricans bemoaned the succession process and Pierluisi’s ties to a federal control board that has promoted cutbacks on the island.“People are disgusted with the government in general, not just Ricardo Rosselló, everyone,” said Janeline Avila, 24, who recently received her degree in biotechnology.Pierluisi served as Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner in Washington between 2009 and 2017 and before that was the US territory’s justice secretary. He is a member of Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive party (PNP) and served as justice secretary under the administration of Pedro Rosselló, the current governor’s father.Several legislators have accused Pierluisi of a conflict of interest because he worked for a law firm that represents the federal control board overseeing the restructuring of more than $70bn in public debt after Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy. The body has repeatedly clashed with local officials over demands for austerity measures.Pierluisi, whose brother-in-law is the board’s chairman, tried to dispel those concerns earlier this week. “Who better than me to advocate for our people before the board? Who better than me to facilitate the process that will force the board to leave? That is what we all want,” he said.Pierluisi told lawmakers he was against several austerity measures demanded by the board, including laying off public employees and eliminating a Christmas bonus.He said he supported public-private partnerships and the privatization of the island’s public power company.“The people want a change, and I don’t blame them,” he said.In addition to concerns over Pierluisi’s past, Puerto Ricans appeared confused and exhausted by the succession process.Rosselló has argued that Pierluisi doesn’t need confirmation from both the house and the senate because he was named secretary of state last week. But several lawmakers and experts argued that Pierluisi did need senate confirmation.On Friday, Pierluisi gave in to that demand.A key obstacle for Pierluisi remains the senate president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, who has said he would not vote for Rosselló’s nominee and wants to run for governor himself next year. Several legislators have said they prefer Rivera Schatz over Pierluisi, but the senate leader is a powerful figure deeply associated with Puerto Rico’s political and business elite, and his elevation to the governorship could re-ignite popular outrage.On Friday, hundreds of protesters marched to the governor’s residence, the Fortaleza, banging pots and drums and singing the national anthem.Bryan Carhu Castro Vega, a 21-year-old university student, was one of hundreds of protesters who had marched to the governor’s residence, the Fortaleza, on Friday.“It’s obvious that the constitutional setup that we have isn’t working for the people,” he said. “None of the options is one the people chose or want or deserve.”Rosa Cifrian, a 47-year-old professor of nursing, said Pierluisi would not be a good governor “for the people.”“He’ll keep promoting policies of austerity, cutbacks, everything that the board says,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be876570a61a746bbc8c2d684ee0baef50cd215b/0_0_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71ad1cf95083f2711a90f65835ee9da0","title":"activists scramble to prevent uighur mans deportation to china","story":"Ablikim Yusuf, who had been living in Pakistan, faces detention and torture if he is sent to China, say supportersHuman rights activists are scrambling to prevent the imminent deportation of a Uighur man to China, where they say he faces torture.Ablikim Yusuf, 53, who has been living in Pakistan, posted a desperate video on Facebook asking for help from the overseas Uighur community. He says in the video, translated and circulated by activists on Saturday: “I am currently being held in Doha airport, about to be deported to Beijing, China. I need the world’s help. I am originally from Hotan.”After the video was shared widely on social media and the campaign gathered momentum, Ablikim was given leave to stay in Qatar for an additional 24 hours, said his lawyer, Kimberley Motley.However, he still faces the threat of deportation to China on Sunday. “We are desperately trying to convince another government to accept him,” she said.China has come under growing international pressure for its treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang, where as many as 1.5 million have been detained in secretive internment and re-education camps.According to activists advocating for Ablikim, he left Xinjiang in 1997 for Pakistan. They said he had left Pakistan on 31 July and was stopped while trying to reach Bosnia. He was brought to Doha International airport, where he was told he would be deported.A representative for Qatar Airways confirmed that Ablikim was booked for a flight departing Doha for Beijing at 11:20am local time on 3 August.“Sending Ablikim back to China would most definitely mean sending him to either concentration camps or prison or worse, his death,” said Salih Hudayar, the founder of the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a political and human rights group based in the US.He and other activists were camped outside the Qatari embassy in Washington in the early hours of Saturday morning.“It would also encourage other countries that China is pressing to deport Uighurs, which in turn would encourage China to continue its brutal campaign of persecution. We are shocked that Qatar would even consider this, given it claims to be a defender of Muslim rights,” he said.On Thursday, a senior Xinjiang official said the majority of those kept in the camps, which China describes as voluntary vocational training centres, had been released. Uighurs with relatives still in Xinjiang expressed incredulity and anger.Critics said such statements obscured the fact that ex-detainees had been shifted into forced labour, kept in other forms of police custody, and continued to be heavily surveilled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85affee249c567db745e9c93d7c9a5f370b324ab/0_0_1861_1117/master/1861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d11356adece9daa6d728f949f10bd90","title":"iran to further reduce compliance with nuclear deal","story":"Foreign minister says Iran has been withdrawing in stages since US pulled out last yearIran will take another step to reduce its compliance with a landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Saturday, according to parliamentary news agency Icana.Iran has repeatedly said it will reduce its commitment to the nuclear accord in stages and may even withdraw from the pact altogether unless the remaining signatories find ways to shield its economy from US sanctions.

Such moves have been long awaited and are a centrepiece of the kingdom’s much-touted reform programme, which has pledged to overhaul rigid laws and customs that have made the country one of the most oppressive in the world.In the capital, Riyadh, women responded enthusiastically to questions about the changes, with some saying they heralded a “renaissance”, and others claiming they would profoundly improve their status.“It means a lot to me and about time,” said Azzah, a woman in her mid-30s. “I have been to hell and back each time I needed my passport renewed, since my father passed in 2000. In 2018, I was able to renew passport without a . The personal fight and standoff at the passport office was not pleasant. More freedoms, I’m sure, will be coming.Dr Maha al-Muneef, the executive director of the National Family Safety Program (NFSP) and a recipient of the 2014 international women of courage award, said: “This takes the dependency on men out of women’s lives. We feel very strong and empowered, and it is completing me as a woman.“It means not only we are equal to men from a human rights perspective but on a practical level it will help women move, do their businesses, attend conferences and learn and be empowered further. It will also improve the situation of abused women dramatically because those who are affected most by ship law usually suffer from domestic violence.”Abeer Mubarak Bin Fahad, a 32-year-old MBA graduate who is searching for a job, was equally enthusiastic and said the implications of the changes were just as important for men. “The question should be what does it mean for Saudi guys who are not used to this and have been raised opposing equality,” she said. “As for conservative elements, they can’t do anything, they can either take it or leave it. If not they can leave us and move to the desert to enjoy life there, where there are no laws and no rules and they can do what they want.”A fourth woman, Wasan Hady Alenzi, a 35-year-old public hospital nurse from the conservative town of Sakākā in northern Saudi Arabia, was more circumspect.“We have stronger and stricter traditions than in Riyadh, which is something that affects women more.

Sarah Keane, chief executive of Swim Ireland and from Clontarf Swimming Club, finished second in the ladies’ competitio with a time of 12 minutes 20 seconds .Swimmers are given a time handicap depending on their level of proficiency, accounting for discrepancies in finish times .Over 600 swimmers took part in the 100th Liffey Swim on Saturday afternoon, despite a level of pollution recorded in the Dublin river this week which would close bathing spots covered by water quality regulations.Speaking after the event, Mr Hanley, from outside Laytown, Co Meath said he was feeling “tired but proud”. “I don’t think anyone goes in expecting to win and I certainly wasn’t,” he said.The 15-year-old took part in the Liffey Swim last year and has been swimming competitively since he was seven. He said water conditions “didn’t put him off”.“I actually thought it was cleaner this year than last year, less gunk on the top. It was easier to swim through.”Ms Delaney, from Dunboyne, Co Meath finished in first place alongside her mother Joan, who also finished in the top ten for the ladies event.“I’m absolutely delighted, I can’t believe it, just absolutely over the moon...I really didn’t expect this,” she said.Ms Delaney, who is based at Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park, took part in her first Liffey Swim 25 years ago, aged 13, alongside her mother.“I was trying to do it on my own and she says ‘mam can I come along with you’. I thought I’d have time on my own and I said ‘oh come on then’ so we’ve being doing it ever since,” said Joan Delaney.Both women said the water was “a little murky with a lot of seaweed” but that the crowds gathered for this year’s event were “brilliant”.“The organisers did a fantastic job with the publicity this year, it’s a huge honour to be part of it, never mind win it. It’s spectacular,” Ms Delaney added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3976707.1564852920!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liffey swim i wouldn t have missed it for anything","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinead Delaney, winner of the women’s race with her mother Joan, who finished 9th  in the  Liffey Swim.

It’s the 100th year and I thought it would be great to have five immediate brothers and a special brother-in-law who’s a sixth brother today.”The six men said they had no times in mind for finishing the event, merely stating “we’re just hoping to complete it”.Just after midday, the first batch of 600 swimmers began to enter the water, which was followed by a rendition of Molly Malone led by the Lord Mayor of Dublin Paul McAuliffe.The waiting participants, with their bright yellow swimming caps, on Victoria Quay threw their hands up in song while the hundreds of spectators gathered across the River Liffey on Wolfe Tone Quay joined in.As the fog horn sounded, the swimmers were off, with little care to the warnings Dublin City Council and the HSE gave about water samples being “exceptionally poor and could cause illness”.At the finish line, one of the oldest participants Claire O’Dwyer (77), from Killiney said the water was “very clean, with only a bit of seaweed now and then”.“It was very good, the water was very clear,” she said. Ms O’Dwyer, who has taken part in the race more than 20 times, said “I wouldn’t have missed it for anything”.“I couldn’t understand it because I’ve swam in much worse than that. That was clean compared to some years. There was no problem whatsoever.”Joe McSweeney (61) from Glasnevin was joined by his family at the end line, including his grandson Darragh (4).“I found it great, it was a fantastic swim, the water was good, great crowd, a very enjoyable day in all.“I found the water quality very good, there’s always queries every year about the Liffey but I think it was over exaggerated about the quality.”As for the O’Neill brothers, Keith O’Muiri or the “sixth brother” said “we survived it”.Teenager Mark Hanley (15) who is part of the North Dublin Swimming Club claimed first place in the men’s event with a time of 10 minutes, while Sinead Delaney, who swims with the Phoenix Club in Clondalkin, won the ladies’ event with a time of 5 minutes and 15 secoonds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3976617.1564848400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second recall issued for bottled water due to above normal arsenic levels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA number of types of bottled water from Aldi, Lidl, Dunnes Stores, Londis and Spar chains have been recalled over higher than normal levels of arsenic. A number of types of bottled water from Aldi, Lidl, Dunnes Stores, Londis and Spar chains have been recalled over higher than normal levels of arsenic. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) have issued a recall notice for: Aldi Comeragh (still and sparkling water), Applegreen (still), Broderick (still), Dunnes Stores (still and sparkling and flavoured), Itica (still), Lidl (still), Londis (still), Mace (still), Macari (still), Plane (still), San Marino (still) and Spar (still).“Arsenic was detected above the legal limit in several branded still and sparkling bottled waters,” the FSAI said. “The implicated batches are being recalled from consumers. Point-of-sale notices will be displayed in stores supplied with the implicated batches.”Retailers have been requested to remove the implicated batches from sale and display a recall notice. The FSAI said consumers are advised not to drink the implicated batches of water. “If you have consumed any of the affected batches and feel unwell, please contact your GP,” they added. In a statement Aldi said Celtic Pure had recalled some products “as a precautionary measure, due to the presence of arsenic above normal levels”. “All of the affected product has been removed from sale at all Aldi Ireland stores.”“Customers should be advised that they will continue to see Comeragh Spring Water for sale in some of our stores. This is because the product in these stores has come from a different Irish supplier and these products are unaffected.”“We apologise for any inconvenience and thank customers for their co-operation.”The supermarket said the bottles and multipacks of the Comeragh Spring Water range affected had batch numbers 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 177, 178,191,192, 199, 201, 202, 203, 204, 211, and 213.It comes after a recall earlier this week of two types of water from Spar and Londis stores.

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms.

They also give women more control over family affairs, making them eligible to be legal s to children, register births, marriages and orces, and be issued legal documents, rather than having a male  do so on their behalf.  The move comes amidst high international scrutiny over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, and widespread media attention after several young women fled the country this year, asking for asylum and protection from their families. About | Human rights in Saudi Arabia“These new regulations…call for the equal engagement of women and men in our society.”Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, presents himself as a reformer and has slowly eroded ship system since he came to power.In 2018 he lifted the ban on women driving in the Kingdom, and allowed women to attend university and seek employment without male permission.Last year, however, the government rounded up and imprisoned the country’s leading women’s rights activists. The country has also faced censure by the UN and foreign governments over the state-sponsored murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.“They’re using these reforms as concessions to the international community, to prop up an image,” says Taif Al Khudary of MENA Rights Group.Saudi Arabia lifted a driving ban for women last year“If they were really committed to women’s rights, they would release the women who fought for these rights for years and have been in prison for over a year now.”It is not yet clear when the new rules will become law. Similar legal changes in the country have been difficult to implement in the past, requiring the rewriting of generations of tradition in Saudi families.Remaining ship rules still require consent from a male  for a woman to marry, and bar women from passing their citizenship on to their children, or allowing their children to marry. They also require male permission to leave prison or a domestic violence shelter, meaning in many cases a woman who has sought shelter from a male  who is abusing her can only leave the facility if that same  agrees to collect her.Activists point out that while the changes are welcome, these are very small concessions given that women are still considered minors under Saudi law. “Whilst women can drive now, it’s important to remember that they still need a male chaperone to go places,” says Al Khudary.“So now they can apply for a passport and travel, but they still need a male  to agree to chaperone them to the airport or they can’t actually get there.”How Trinny and Susannah fueled the rise of rude TVWhaley Bridge dam in danger of collapse as threat of storms increasesWoman undergoes quadruple amputation after being licked by pet dogComment: Harry and Meghan are talking nonsense: we\u0026#39ll soon be fretting about the falling populationComment: Mark Carney needs to keep his mouth shut and let the Government get on with delivering BrexitCan Playboy win over the #MeToo generation?MEPs treated to chauffeur service, £220 chairs and sparkling water fountains as taxpayers foot the billTrue identity of the Great Train Robber known as \u0026#39The Ulsterman\u0026#39 finally revealedSyrians in Turkey rounded up for return as Assad pummels last rebel strongholdComment: It\u0026#39s time to stop blaming the elderly for the housing crisisDescendants of slave owners join Democratic candidates\u0026#39 call for reparationsElectric skateboard crash kills man just weeks after YouTube star dies on e-scooterRussian police arrest more than 600 protesters in central Moscow\u0026#39Vulnerable\u0026#39 white Zimbabwean farmers say they are desperate for long-awaited compensation payoutsComment: \tForget leave vs remain – it\u0026#39s the split in the Labour party that\u0026#39s really changing British politics Hong Kong protesters block tunnel as marches continue in defiance of BeijingSkirmishes over Hong Kong protests reflect growing Chinese influence on foreign university campusesKevin Spacey makes first public appearance since sex assault allegations with pointed poetry readingSudan military and protesters reach full agreement on transitional government after months of negotiationBrazil space research chief to leave job after Bolsonaro rejects data showing huge jump in Amazon deforestationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sea water microscope monsters swimming","story":"Next time you take a dip in the sea, beware -

But circulation has plummeted and is now somewhere below 400,000.Changing fashions made Playboy an anachronism and after a series of relaunches it is now trying to appeal to the millennial, #MeToo generation.  Founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, Playboy not only offered titillation but also serious writing, publishing short stories by writers as erse as Margaret Atwood and Roald Dahl as well as illustrations by some of America\u0027s most celebrated cartoonists like Jules Feiffer.  Hefner died in 2017 and for the first time, no members of the Hefner family are involved in the magazine, which is run by financier Ben Kohn.Kate Moss on the 60th anniversary issue of Playboy when the magazine announced it would stop publishing nude photosNudes are back, having been banished from its pages by Cooper Hefner, Hugh\u0027s son, in late 2015. A year later he recanted admitting that the move had been an error.  I\u0027ll be the first to admit the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but removing it entirely was a mistake, he tweeted.  Nudity was never the problem, because nudity isn\u0027t a problem. Today, we\u0027re taking our identity back and rediscovering who we are.But the approach is somewhat different from the magazine\u0027s traditional approach, which critics regarded as blatantly sexist and exploitative.  The latest magazine features an underwater nude shot, but the participants are not traditional models.  From the start, Playboy had worked to set itself apartOne is an underwater dancer who uses the medium to promote ocean conservation. Another, a Belgian artist, has already filmed herself walking naked through a Hasidic neighbourhood in Brooklyn.Many of the pictures in the magazine are taken by women photographers. Two of Playboy\u0027s editors previously worked for Ms, a publication co-founded by the feminist icon Gloria Steinem.The attempt to merge nudity and art is just the latest attempt by the Playboy empire to reinvent itself. Among the changes, the magazine has also become an ad-free quarterly.An editor\u0027s letter in the winter 2019 edition sought to convince readers of the new approach.Today, we strive to be more inclusive, stretching and redefining tired and frankly sexist definitions of beauty, arousal and eroticism.Not everybody is convinced, though - including Joanna Coles, a former editor in chief of Cosmopolitan.Through today\u0027s lens, Hugh Hefner is grotesque and his women victims, she told the New York Times.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018Siri, Apple’s iconic voice assistant, allows users to work their iPhone without using their hands, and can send messages, make calls and open multiple applications with voice commands alone.Consumers have become accustomed to calling out names for popular voice assistants, such as Amazon Inc’s Alexa, Google Inc’s Google Assistant, among others.In an effort to perform quality checks and improve the voice assistant’s responses, contractors graded Siri’s answers to user queries. They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, without a deliberate query from the user, the newspaper said.Amazon, which operates the hugely-popular Alexa assistant, is yet to make a similar commitment to Apple and Google, despite admitting in April that\u0026nbspemployees can listen to customer voice recordings\u0026nbspfrom Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers.“This information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone,” Amazon said in a statement at the time.“We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

What they do\u0026nbspknow is that the\u0026nbsproad ahead is\u0026nbsplooking\u0026nbsprockier by the day.\u0026nbspCarney reiterated that the Bank’s forecasts and projections are still predicated on a deal getting done, which is still more or less official government policy. But they’ve been downgraded, in part reflective of the fact that the UK economy has started to seize up as a result of all the uncertainty. \u0026nbspIn the meantime, he and his people have done their best to ensure that, for example, the banking system will be able to cope with the hard shock of a no-deal outcome. The big ones are pretty well capitalised. Hopefully we’ll avoid an RBS or HBOS 2.0 if the yucky stuff hits the fan courtesy of the Conservative Party’s descent into a nationalist pit and its determination to break the country on the back of its fevered fantasies.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Some of them are showing real signs of strain and, as Northern Rock graphically demonstrated, it only takes a small bank tipping up to create a very big mess.At least consumers are behaving in a “prudent manner”. In other words, they’re being careful not to borrow too much to fund their spending, offering some crumbs to Carney and his colleagues. \u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspcomfort is slim.

No deal will cause it to fall further. Traders will soon be using it as cheap substitute for toilet paper.\u0026nbspThe MPC doesn’t have much firepower to “support the economy” with rates at 0.75 per cent.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.According to trade publication Pollstar, the Divide tour’s final show tally is 255, compared with U2’s 100 dates for their 360 Tour.The number of shows Sheeran played was key to him breaking the attendance record, as he played to an average of 34,541 per show compared to U2’s 66,091.He is currently enjoying a third week at the top of the UK album charts with No. 6 Collaborations Project, which features guest stars including 50 Cent, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, Chris Stapleton and Eminem.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Would it have consciousness? And what happens if these stem cells turn into sperm cells?”But Estrella Nunez, of Murcia Catholic University (UCAM) and the project collaborator, said mechanisms were put in place so that if human cells did migrate to the brain, they would self-destruct.“The results are very promising,” Ms Nunez said.The research, which was financed largely by the university, was costly. “If we combine the humanpig, humanrat and humanmonkey research, it is many hundreds of thousands of euros,” she said.Dr Raya said scientists have traditionally set a “red line” at 14 days’ gestation, which is not long enough for the embryo to develop a human central nervous system. All chimera embryos are destroyed before that time.Juan Carlos Izpisua, who created the world’s first human-pig hybrid in 2017 and led the latest experiment, said: “We are now trying not only to move forward and continue experimenting with human cells and rodent and pig cells, but also with non-human primates. Our country is a pioneer and a world leader in these investigations.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes.

Kids are doing it and I don’t think they realise how dangerous it is. Celebrities are putting stuff on Instagram and Facebook and it seems to be more popular than it ever has been.“Having good videos to put on Facebook and to say ‘look at what I have just jumped off’. I don’t think social media has made it any easier.”“Everywhere I go there are kids jumping into water and it turns my stomach,” he added. “It is about time something was done to be honest.”The Coastguard has dealt with more than 200 incidents of tombstoning since 2004, with 70 injuries and 20 deaths.\u0026nbspKaimes Beasley, duty maritime operations controller at the maritime and coastguard agency, said: “Jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous.“The depth of the water can dramatically change with the tide, and what was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by teatime. You don’t know what hazards may be lurking under the surface until you are hurt or worse.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Books spill out from the pavement stalls onto the street, where browsers kneel to rifle through an eclectic offering.Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits alongside a book of American idioms. Thick engineering textbooks compete with countless biographies of George Bush and histories of the US invasion. But the street has a story as gripping as any of the books on sale.\u0026nbspReligious books used to dominate the market. Then for years under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the sellers were restricted in what they could offer. “I was jailed for selling ‘The Generals are the Last to Know,’” says one stall owner who goes by the name Haider ‘Magazine’.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing.

He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.“The idea of the book is that Saddam entered Kuwait without the knowledge of the generals. It was forbidden.”Mutanabbi’s Street’s troubles didn’t end with Hussein. In 2007, a car bomb ripped through the market, killing 30 people and injuring hundreds. It took years for it to recover.Today, the street is alive again, and the bestseller list is moving with the times.“The people who are buying are young people, honestly. They are currently looking for novels, or stories,” says Maher Muhammad, a bookshop owner on the street.“But this thing will not last. What do we say about that? It’s just like a pot will boil and collapse.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s.

He also made her a Thanpuying, a royal title meaning Lady during the lavish ceremony.However, the kings pristine ceremonial outfit was a far cry from the outrageous croptop and low-slung jeans he was once spotted wearing while wandering around a German shopping centre.The monarch even threatened to sue Facebook over the startling shots, taken in  by a passer-by who recognised the king.The images, which appeared to show Maha out for a stroll with a girlfriend while wearing fake tattoo “sleeves”, fall foul of Thailand’s extremely strict law of “lese-majeste” — or insulting royalty.But the king’s bizarre dress sense is just the tip of the iceberg for this clearly very dferent monarch.Indeed, his string of failed marriages and apparently insatiable appetite for women - his own mother Queen Sirikit branded him a womaniser - has had Thais quietly gossiping for years.During a  trip to the US, Sirikit said: “My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan.He is a good student, a good boy, but women find him interesting and he finds women even more interesting.”Maha has ruled Thailand since the death last year of his father who was married to Sirikit for  of those years.But in stark contrast to his father, Brit-educated Maha has already orced three times - and is now on his FOURTH we.In  he married his first we — his cousin, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara.They had a daughter, Bajrakitiyabha, but the relationship was doomed from the start.During the marriage Maha fathered four sons and a daughter with his mistress, actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth.They began living together but his we refused to orce him.Finally, in , he sued for orce, laying the blame for the failed relationship entirely at Soamsawali’s feet.He married Yuvadhida the following year but after a mysterious bust-up two years later, she fled to the UK to escape her husband.Livid Maha ordered posters to be placed all around his palace accusing her of adultery with a -year-old Thai air marshal.The prince then had his daughter brought back to Thailand. His four sons say they were banned from ing by their father.In a letter written in  they said: “We were ordered by our father not tohome to Thailand. We were afraid to risk even demonstrating the slightest inference of disrespect toward the Royal Family.”In  the king married his third we — former waitress Srirasmi Suwadee, who had been in his service since .He kept the marriage secret from the public until , when she gave birth to their son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.Maha even told a magazine it was his intention to settle down.The pair bought a poodle, Foo Foo, which Maha became devoted to in a way that even the most ardent dog lover would find extreme.He made it an Air Chief Marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force and the dog appeared at official s dressed in a dinner jacket.In  Foo Foo was a guest at a reception held by the US Ambassador Ralph Boyce.In a leaked document, Mr Boyce said: “Foo Foo was present at the event, dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts.“At one point during the band’s second number, he jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from the guests’ water glasses, including my own.“The Air Chief Marshal’s antics drew the full attention of the -plus audience members, and remains the talk of the town to this day.”Foo Foo hit the headlines once again when a video from its birthday party surfaced online.It appears to show topless Srirasmi lying on the floor in just a G-string, feeding cake to the dog.She sings Happy Birthday to it before getting on her hands and knees and eating from the same bowl as Foo Foo.When the dog died in  Maha gave it a four-day funeral complete with Buddhist rites before it was cremated in a lavish ceremony.A year earlier he orced Srirasmi, stripped her royal titles and exiled her to an undisclosed location in Thailand — with a reported settlement of £.m.He then jailed her parents for two-and-a-half years for “royal defamation”. Soon afterwards he hooked-up with his latest we Vajiralongkorn - who is nicknamed Nui.Among the dignitaries at their wedding were Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the military junta that has run Thailand since a  army coup.While the king took the throne after the death of his father, his formal coronation follows a mourning period for King Bhumibol, whose royal cremation was held a year after his death.

However, due to it being located on a toll road, drivers must pay £.they want to get access to it. Meanwhile, Thurrock Services, on the M, was voted the worst in Britain, described as “gloriously ugly” and “a building site”. Reviews claimed the service station’s toilets were “disgusting” and advised: “Avoidyou have other options.” The top six service stations are all to be found in the Midlands or the North.    But does Norton Canes deserve itaposs title Birmingham Liveaposs Graham Young went to find out what Britainaposs best service station is really like, and hereaposs what he thought.Grahamaposs Verdict: Itaposs barely  miles up the M with a short detour down the M Toll - but by the time I got to Roadchef Norton Canes Services my tongue was hanging out. In late morning on one of the busiest holiday Fridays of the year, the M was frustratingly rammed at all of the usual hotspots as I headed for the Fresh Food Cafe. An hour-long journey seemed like an eternity en route to a late breakfast. Especially as the green oasis service station has just been voted the UKaposs No  M-way stop for the second time. And yet... the M Toll itself was as quiet as the M itself was busy. So what I couldnapost then believe was how there seemed to be more cars in the Roadchef Car Park than Iaposd see on the M Toll to get to it.    Just outside the servicesapos main pedestrian entrance, some mouthwatering posters greeted me with the words: aposFresh Food Cafe - Breakfast Platesapos with a clever catchphrase: aposItaposs why you stoppedapos. Once inside the services, the main building was heaving too, especially around the narrow corridor that leads to both male and female toilets. Then it was time to seethe breakfast would be worth the ludicrous £. toll fee just to travel a few miles each way from the M.The breakfastIf you are not in time for breakfast at the Fresh Food Cafe, then you are too late. In my case, by  minutes - with a server who would, or could not, bend the rules. Ooops! No matter... you then order Breakfast Brunch for £.. The only trouble being, this option swaps two hash browns for about  measly chips. And you only get one egg, one sausage and one rasher of bacon instead of two of each as advertised on the outdoor breakfast poster. I ordered at the till and then had to wait for about four minutes while my plate was made up.    Once it was ready, I had to carry it to the main dining hall, hoping fervently that a table would be free so that I could sit down to eat it... Most of the family-sized tables in the dining room were full but I managed to go solo in a corner, just like Billy No Mates... or Tom the Trucker. The arched ceiling echoed the sound of all the children, making it feel like I was at a swimming pool that had been filled in. Tucking into the breakfast, I noticed how short inall of the chips were - and that there were barely two dozen of them. They seemed to have been frozen at birth and had virtually no taste. The mushroom was nice and big, though. A touch too moist, asit had been hanging around, so it was more sweaty Betty than, er, magic. The beans in tomato sauce tasted like beans in tomato sauce. No corners had been cut here which would have been the ultimate heresy.    I left the egg a few minutes, but it was still runny when I broke into the yolk. It was the best bit of the whole meal. The one rasher of bacon had lots of nice fat around the edges to potentially add flavour - but sadly hadnapost been crisped how I like it. And then there was the sausage. I sliced it in half right down the middle like I was a pathologist conducting a post mortem. I just knew what it would look like on the inside. And it wasnapost healthy. A quick taste of one end told me all I needed to know. The meat content was so low as to make the whole thing a waste of time. I gave it a speciality name before paying my last respects to O Sausage Bin Ready. Verdict:  The coffeeI noticed that Fresh Food Cafeaposs coffee came from a barista-free, push button Franke machine like the ones Wetherspoon use. But whereas the JD pubs charge you pand give you free refills, a single coffee at the Fresh Food Cafe is a whopping £..    The taste was as unfulfilling as I suspected it would be. For the price, it was actually a joke. Verdict:  AlternativesSoups like carrot and coriander can be bought at the Fresh Food Cafe for £..

Fuel prices at the BP garage were a sky-high .p for unleaded or .p for diesel - but at least they were price-matched with the neighbouring M Hilton Park services. The current ASDA price in Birmingham is .p. Near to the main entrance of the services outside of the Days Inn aposhotelapos, I could only see twocharging points for drivers of electric cars. Given the typically confusing layout of the car park, it wonapost take long for there to have to be a radical rethink when more people have electric cars - especially given theof time it took me to drive the  miles just to get there.  . The car park was so busy it had attendants directing traffic. One member of staff said: Itaposs always really busy Friday to Sunday during the day but it will be aposdeadapos after pm. Sunday will be the worst day when fans of Liverpool and Man City will be travelling back from the Charity Shield at Wembley. Whichever teams loses will have the worst behaved fans so we will have security here.. Even though itaposs not yet September, the car park was buzzing with wasps. One staff member said: There was a haze of wasps at the centreaposs back door today. We had to burn cardboard to get rid of them. . A nearby hill is popular with dog walkers. Not only does it give you a relaxing birds-eye view of the services and car park, there is a very scenic trail leading away from it, too. The bad news is that even though a sign warns of £ fines for dog mess, I could smell some once I wandered  yards up the track so I quickly turned back. At the top of the hill you will also find Richard Thorntonaposs December  Air Pulse Memorial for the Midlands Air Ambulance charityaposs th anniversary. Overall verdict The breakfast was OK but not exceptional either in taste or value for money. The kne had a couple of stains on it, suggesting no attempt was made to polish the cutlery once it came out of the dishwasher. And yet, as far as motorway services go, the all-round pleasant environment at Roadchef Norton Canes really does make it one of the best in the country. The hillside trail is greatyou want to stretch your legs. The main dining room has a high ceiling to reduce the sense of claustrophobia closer to the main entrance. If you love Costa, you will like the fact they have two barista bars and thereaposs outdoor seating, too.

Ruth Johnson was tonight identied as one of the people who tried in vain to stop Alana Cutland, , from plummeting ,ft out the aircraft as it flew above Madagascar. Ms Johnson is currently trying to come to terms with what she witnessed. The -year-old, who lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where she teaches at the £,-a-term Winchester House School, frantically tried to hold onto the teen for several minutes as half her body hung out the plane. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror    Tragically Alana, from Milton Keynes, slipped from her grasp. Local police chief Spinola Nomenjanahary reportedly said the teacher had screamed come back, come back as she had tried to save her. He is said to have added: Ruth said it all happened so fast she was lucky to even catch hold of her leg in time. The teenaposs body has not yet been found and her family believe she was hallucinating on prescription drugs and didnapost intend to kill herself. Ms Johnsonaposs bravery has now been described as stunning by her husband Matthew Smith. He told the Daily Mail:  Sheaposs our Wonder Woman. We are all so proud of her. She has been through a harrowing, awful ordeal and she just needs time and space to recover. Ruth was going out of her way to chaperone the poor girl and tried with all of her strength to save her le.    Ruthaposs bravery was stunning. But at the end of it all, a family has lost a daughter. Thataposs foremost in all our minds. Mr Smith added that everyone is so proud of Ruth but she is still coming to terms with what she witnessed, adding it will stay with her for the rest of her le. Ms Johnson had spent three weeks in Madagascar teaching in remote village schools and donating clothes, games, books and classroom equipment. She was staying at the Anjajavy Le Lodge in the north of the island where she met Alana, whose mental health had reportedly started to deteriorate. Alana was due to stay for  days while working on a conservation project investigating crabs in the nature reserve in the north of the island.    But the Biological Natural Sciences student decided tohome after just eight days after suffering a series of panic attacks. At the request of Alanaaposs parents, Ms Johnson was accompanying her home when the tragedy unfolded on July , just five minutes into the two hour and  minute flight. It is understood Alana unbuckled her seatbelt, leaned forward and turned the door handle prompting the pilot to desperately try and close it. Ms Johnson then tried to stop Alana from falling out, but was battling the wind and rocking of the plane. Pilot Mahefa Tahina Rantoanina, , said the teenager stayed “completely silent during the horrying incident. He told The Sun: “I had just taken off and I was still climbing when all of a sudden there was a rush of wind and Ruth started screaming. I turned round and saw Alana hanging out of my plane.    “I immediately levelled the aircraft to try and keep us on course, then I reached over and held the door. “I was trying to pull it shut while Ruth was holding on to Alana’s leg. I was trying to fly and stop her from falling at the same time. I was absolutely terried, we all were. Extensive searches to try and locate Alana in an area which includes a lake, dense forest, woodland and swamps have so far proved fruitless. As we previously reported, Alana was mumbling and incoherent in the days before her death, according to her uncle, Lester Riley.    He said she had became sick during her time in Madagascar, possibly due to prescription medication, although reports have claimed police are investigating her possible use of an anti-malaria drug. He told MailOnline: She had taken ill after being there for a few days and when she spoke to her mother on the phone two days before the accident she was mumbling and sounded pretty incoherent. We think she had suffered a severe reaction to some drugs but not anti-malaria ones because she had taken those on her trip last year to China without any side effects. One of Alanaaposs friends also claims the Brit sounded upset in a final phone call to her mum and said: Me, plane, home. A source claimed to the Sun: Alana was taking a type of malaria drug and police are working on a theory that is what was sending her delirious. Her last phone call to her mum wasnapost like her at all. It didnapost make sense. She wasnapost in the right frame of mind and it was unlike any normal conversation she would have had.

Typically I’d cover Donald Trump’s rallies from either behind the penned barricades or from the safety of a live feed off a TV news channel. But this time it was dferent. For, after braving five hours waiting to board the Trump Train at the President’s latest  re-election rally, I joined thousands of his supporters in Cincinnati’s C heat to become just another face in the crowd. Like the President, I was more interested in how his base responded, and to what, opting this time to just listen to what they were saying to each other, and to Trump, instead of fact-checking his every word.  The President wasn’t scheduled to take to the stage until pm but by .pm, after being patted down by the Secret Service, I’d taken my seat stage right. Sitting alongside the Deplorables, as Hillary Clinton labelled Trump’s supporters, I was told by farmer and uber Trump fan Nick Pepper to expect “fireworks”. “This will be like nothing you’ve ever seen before,” the three-time rally veteran told me. “He’s our leader and we believe in what he says. “If President Trump says we need a wall, we need a wall. “If he says send those who don’t like our country home, send them home. “He delivers on his promises.” As , filled the US Bank Arena, the die-hard crowd were played like a symphony orchestra as Team Trump whipped supporters into a frenzy as they waited for their messiah. One-by-one, local politicians and judges – yes, they are political here – took to the stage to tell why the President should be re-elected on November  next year, only then for the real warm-up act to enter. Grinning inanely like a constipated Cheshire Cat, Don Trump Jr, swaggered his way to the podium. Having torn himself away from the killing fields and put down his big-game hunting rles, the President’s eldest child picked up his political pistols to fire off volley after volley of attacks on his father’s critics. Whether it be Trump’s political opponents, cities which his dad had attacked, immigration or mocking Joe Biden, nothing was off-limits. Then, after what seemed like the entire Rolling Stones back catalogue, Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger kicked in and the crowd knew the king of bungle was due on stage. He swaggered on like a power-hungry Roman emperor, giving the same thumbs-up Caesar gave in his adoring amphitheatres. As he paced the walkway and smiled and waved, the crowd leapt to its feet and roared, waving campaign-provided signs reading, “Jobs Jobs Jobs” and “Women for Trump”. But it didn’t take long before the President was throwing political red meat to the baying crowd who applauded his every sentence, boast and lie. They reached their thunderous loudest quickly, however, when several protesters showed their hand. In unison, like a military-run pack of hyenas, the crowd turned on them as they held up posters reading, “Immigrants Built America”. The protesters’ cries that Trump was a racist were drowned by chants of “USA, USA,” and “Trump, Trump, Trump,” before the President told “law enforcement” to move in. Quickly, the US leader got back on message. He mocked rival Democrats for attacking former President Barack Obama during a debate this week and got in hits at rivals Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren during his remarks. But it was the behaviour of the crowd that I and the world were watching, following last month’s rally in North Carolina. There, Trump had continued his racist broadside at a foursome of Democratic congresswomen of colour known as The Squad, telling them to “go back” to the countries they came from – even though three of them were born in the States. Trump supporters at that rally increased the attack with chants of “send her back”. This time, Cincinnati’s crowd offered their fair share of boos, cheers of “USA”, “build the wall,” and even ed to the  campaign chant regarding Hillary Clinton, screaming “lock her up”. But they didn’t go as far as the Carolina supporters, as Trump told the arena: “We want no controversy”. He did, however, blame “the far-left’s destructive agenda” for poverty and crime in inner cities, increasing his effort to tie Democrats to poor neighbourhoods. Trump accused his rivals of prioritising undocumented immigrants over American citizens, called Calornia “a disgrace to our country” and sought to talk up his efforts to improve minority communities. “For decades, these communities have been run exclusively byDemocrat politicians and it’s been total one-party control of the inner cities,” he said. “For  years it’s been one-party control and look at them. We can name one after another but I won’t do that because I don’t want to be controversial.” Trump’s remarks were a clear reference to his recent attacks on Elijah Cummings, the black Democratic lawmaker whose Baltimore district Trump described as “rat and rodent-infested” and a place where “no human being would want to live”.  Trump belittled the Maryland city, a majority-black borough, claiming its murder rate is higher than war-torn Afghanistan. Tellingly, the vast majority in the arena were white – I counted no more than  African Americans. For an hour and  minutes, Trump rambled along, at times incoherently ignoring the autocue, but he knows how to sell himself to his crowd.  His repealing of the Iran nuclear deal, his scuttling of the Paris accords and the moving of the US embassy to Jerusalem, he insisted, had “restored American pride”. “Keep America great again,” he boomed, as he closed his show. The salesman in Trump had sold Cincinnati precisely what they wanted to hear.

And whilst they were not successful in tagging that particular beast, their hard work paid off as they were able to tag a male shark days later.     Little is known of the bluntnose sixgill in popular culture, but marine biologists studying them believe they can grow up to ft long. Ocean X said: The team came back to a hero’s welcome and a watch party of the footage in mission control. This is historic for a iety of reasons.

are doing their bit to help save lives by purchasing a potentially lesaving device for the community.Parishioners at Holburn West Church have bought a public-access defibrillator which,needed, could save the le of someone suffering heart problems.The device will be available for any member of the public to use while the church is open.It will also be logged on the Scottish Ambulance Service’s national database – enabling  operators to direct callers to the nearest defibrillator and dramatically increase the chance of survival.The church’s joint session clerk, city councillor Martin Greig, said churchgoers had taken inspiration from Scandinavia.He said: “We were given a really interesting piece of information about Norway.“Someone there who suffers heart problems has a much higher chance of survival because there is a higher number of defibrillators available to the public.“The congregation decided they want to follow that example and have a defibrillator here to be usedit is needed.“More and more churches and organisations are installing defibrillators because there is much more awareness of the importance of them and the vital role they play in saving lives.”Mr Greig added: “It’s an important public health issue and we are trying to be responsible citizens by making sure we do this.“We want there to be as many of these as possible in the city.“You hope it’s something that is never needed but it is thereit is.”A defibrillator gives reassurance in case of an emergency, said Mr Greig.He added: “It dramatically increases the chance of a good outcome.”The device was provided by Stuart Gordon of Inverurie-based firm SMG Safety who also trained members of the congregation on how to use the vital piece of equipment.Stuart said: “The statistics show that, for every minute without defibrillation, your chances of survival are dropping by a massive %. However,you can get a defibrillator on the casualty within three minutes, your chances can go up to an encouraging %.“It is great that the church has installed this le-saving piece of equipment as the ious halls within the church are used by a number of community groups.“This will give everyone peace of mind and ensure they can do everything they can should anything like this occur in the building.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17320160-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17320160-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17320160-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17320160-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"board member appointed at north east charity","story":"A food and drink boss has joined the board of a north-east charity.Ceri Ritchie has joined the board of CLAN Cancer Support.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall.

Some older cars rely on  ron petrol and with the replacement of the pumps in the Esso garage, drivers will be forced to drive almost  miles to Dunbeg, by Oban, or  miles to Helensburgh.Lochgilphead resident Lockhart Leitch raised the issue with MSP Michael Russell who contacted Esso for a response.A spokesperson for Esso said: #We recently replaced the pumps at the Tesco Esso Lochgilphead service station, removing supreme unleaded and replacing it with supreme diesel in addition to the regular unleaded and diesel products.#Sales of regular diesel make up two thirds of all fuel sales at this site, therefore having this additional diesel grade provides an alternative option for a bigger proportion of our customerswe experience dficulties with replenishing regular diesel stocks when the weather challenges us to reach Lochgilphead.#Although it would be a long drive, we can offer a supreme unleaded grade at Helensburgh Express as well as a site near Oban.#We continually review the fuel offerings at all our sites but at the current time we have no plans to reinstate supreme unleaded at Lochgilphead. We did advise the community with two weeks notice of our plans to close the forecourt during the works, however, I note we could have done better in providing advance notice of the grade change specically and we will endeavour to provide notices on site in advance of any future changes.#MSP Michael Russell said: #I would be concernedthere was a reduction in choice in any of the garages. If people need  ron they should be able to get it locally, particularly where there is more than one petrol station.#Narrowing the choice and making people drive to buy petrol is never a good idea.#In response, Lockhart Leitch said: #The reply from Esso is, to my mind, a typical big company response. They are entitled to change productsthey are not selling as they would like, however, to change from Supreme petrol to Supreme diesel without at least notying customers in advance that Supreme unleaded will no longer be sold is diabolical.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inchorus-aim-another-sell-out-fringe","story":"PEEBLES community choir InChorus is making a welcometo the Edinburgh Fringe next

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre.

My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

And would you recommend it to your friends back home  The answer to this one, however, was an emphatic ldquonon.Why  The trains, of course. Rickety, overcrowded, overbooked carriages, lack of luggage space, uncomfortable seats, catering that comprised of crisps and instant coffee, inadequate windows, overgrown trees making visibility dficult, service cancellations their list of complaints was extensive. The rolling stock, they said incredulously, was little better than that used on the local network in Glasgow, despite the journey from Mallaig to Glasgow taking five and a half hours.My heart sank. Irsquod tried to warn them that the trains would not be up to European standards, but they were aghast at the reality. ldquoWhat a terrible waste of incredible landscape, they kept saying. I was ashamed but couldnrsquot argue with a word of what they said. Irsquove taken the West Highland Line three times in the last five years and had passenger experiences that range from not as bad as Irsquod feared, to bloody awful. The staff who work on the trains are pleasant and stoic, but the trains themselves are an embarrassing disgrace.Greatest railway journey on earth  Hardly. That the landscape is breath-taking and spectacular isnrsquot in question. Glimpsing white sandy beaches and shimmering sea through the mountains on the approach to Mallaig is one of lersquos great experiences. But when yoursquore assured a more comfortable ride with better visibility and catering on the local rail network in Munich, something is fundamentally amiss.Read more: Row over -day closure of West Highland LineTo think that Scotland is letting its visitors down in this way, not to mention the communities that would see such economic benefit from a well-served West Highland Line, is frustrating and depressing in equal measure, especially since rail tourism, with its cleaner environmental footprint, is surely the future.Not that the state of trains is putting tourists off. Indeed, the global trumpeting of Scotland means passenger numbers are rising on all branches of the line Glenfinnan station saw a  per cent increase last year. Tourism has never been more valuable to the Scottish economy, bringing in upwards of poundbn a year, with visitors from Europe and the US flocking here off the back of a cheap pound and TV shows such as Outlander.But the more visitors that come, the more ill-equipped ScotRail will be to give them a pleasant journey on the West Highland Line. Improvements have been promised many times over the years but come to nothing. A few extra services have been put on in summer, and some new carriages with better luggage space are apparently in the offing. But better trains with improved seating and windows, and locally-sourced catering, are still nowhere to be seen, despite being mooted after Abellio was given the rail franchise in October .To be fair, ScotRail can only work within the financial confines of its contract. And a painfully slow-moving Transport Scotland review of the line is charged only with exploring improvements within current levels of investment. Itrsquos also worth pointing out that the line is old and remote, which limits the type of trains that could be run, and the Highlands has long been at the back of the queue when it comes to rail upgrades.Whatrsquos needed now, then, is a far more ambitious improvement plan for the West Highland Line, one that includes infrastructure boosts for the communities along the way as well as fully-staffed, modern trains with viewing carriages, comfortable seating and a high-quality catering offering serving tasty local produce. In other words, the sort of trains that are the norm on scenic journeys in Germany, Switzerland and France. How did they get such trains  By making public transport and tourism a political priority.If the political will existed in Scotland to raise the funds and bring stakeholders together, the West Coast Line could have the best trains in Europe. Are you listening, SNP Government  You canrsquot just blame ScotRail and Westminster-all need to work together forchange.Boris Johnson makes his first Prime Ministerial visit to Scotland today, fresh from backing a high-speed rail link between Leeds and Manchester. He could do worse than trying to win over his many detractors here by promising the Scottish Government the sort of funding that could transform our rail infrastructure. And first in the queue for investment should be the West Highland Line. Without it, this jewel in the crown of Scottish tourism can never be a truly great railway journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Judge society by how happy we are  not how wealthy","story":"The merest glimpse of the lives of moguls, oligarchs and millionaires tells you that. Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king.

One wonders how high his brother and sister-in-laws eyebrows rose at this line.Its a surprise its taken the prince so long to reach this position given his fathers preoccupation with the environment - but who of us listens to our parents If Harry has been listening he would have heard the Prince of Wales in  make a speech on Islam and the environment, calling for religious views that prevent the use of contraceptives to be considered alongside the \"monumental\" pressures on the planet of overpopulation.He lamented that traditional communities are becoming more consumerist and called on countries to retain local crafts in order to help save the planet, before jetting off to carry out the most overseas trips of any British royal.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Meghan guest edits British Vogue\",\"description\": \"Meghan guest edits British Vogue\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs mOhdOGKm-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests mOhdOGKm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch own official Instagram accountCharles, though, was a little ahead of his time. Questioning our inidual impact on the environment is fashionable now and a part of current public conversation. Earlier this year the American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that it is a \"legitimate question\" whether or not to have children in the current environment.Harrys views, then, are nothing new. Nor is Meghans decision to guest edit a magazine. The Duchess of Cambridge guest edited the Huffington Post while Prince Harry guest edited Radio Four. If anything should stick in the craw, its that members of a royal family which vocally despises the press quite enjoy trying a hand at journalism themselves. But thats perhaps a niche complaint.As well as mulling over who shall inherit the earth, Harry mulled over with Jane Goodall how we inherit our prejudices with regard to unconscious racist bias. \"Just as stigma is handed down from generation to generation, your perspective on the world and on le and on people is something that is taught to you.\"Harrys views are, though, new to him and his awokening, from Nazi fancy dress costume to nuanced understanding of racial discrimination, is no doubt heavily influenced by his educated, politically aware, feminist we. No bad thing, yet somehow it is.It was to be expected that Prince Harrys we - no matter who she was - would attract public scrutiny. Meghan, a well-established woman with a mind of her own, could never have been expected to twist herself into the shape of the demur, modest royal the public and the right leaning press desire.What Britain asks of its royals is to play a very specic game. To have insight into the struggles of their subjects despite living le at great remove. To be modest despite great riches. To be hard working without any real context for what hard work entails.Meghan was a celebrity, an Instagram influencer and a lestyle blogger and, now a senior royal, she has carried on regardless.Harry and Meghan are far enough removed from the throne that we should be able to say good luck to them. Behave like the Clooneysyou so wish. Even behave like the Kardashiansyou must.We cant say this, however, and there are two sticking points. One, the Kardashian and Clooney money is self-made: the Sussexes are part publicly funded. Two, celebrities promote only themselves the royal family is representing the United Kingdom. We should, it follows, have a say in how we want to be represented.For a pass-remarkable British public which respects the Queen for her apolitical, wide-ranging charitable support, the Sussexes are easy targets for traditionalists. No one likes to be preached to and heres rich Harry chiding people for eating fruit wrapped in plastic, while scooting about on private jets.The British upper lip stfens at the notion of schmaltzy instructions to \"be the change\" and \"live in the deep like a mermaid\". Britain expects access to its royal family in exchange for their luxuries so asking for privacy - keeping the lid of Archies christening, turning Frogmore Cottage into a fortress, forbidding photos at Wimbledon - ruffle feathers.Yet Meghan has been protective of her privacy since day one. Think on her engagement announcement interview: she would not be drawn on the identity of the matchmaker who brought her and her fianceacute together because she wanted to protect them.:Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle announce engagementIt stands to reason she would be reluctant to put her sons godparents in the spotlight and hypocritical of her to change her stance. Shes basically being lambasted for sticking to her principles and this is part of the problem: so many of the things initially attributed to making Meghan a breath of fresh air have been turned against her.The Sussexes are taking joint decisions as a household yet Meghan is the target of the associated flak. Four of the biggest gun right-wing columnists have used their  this week to try to take her down a peg or two. Her Vogue stewardship has been the source of television debate Eamonn Holmes on This Morning labelled her with the deeply problematic epithet \"uppity\".This flak comes in response to her doing things other royals have done before and singling her out in this way smacks of racism. From some quarters it does more than smack.She has been criticised for wearing too few British designers for how she touched her bump while pregnant for how she has influenced Harry for being rude to Palace staff for feuding with Kate Middleton. All othering, racist, sexist critiques.It is one thing to dislike the Sussexes as a brand and entirely another to claw and claw at Meghan Markle. Youd think we might have learned a lesson about tearing at royal women in this way.

There was no attempt to look at the material in the show to seeit was offensive ndash just a knee-jerk reaction from the venue. The fact that a white guy was saying it was enough, they assumed it wasnrsquot from my personal experience. It showed their prejudice and discrimination rather than mine.

I have to be conscious about the way I say things so they can see Irsquom in the same boat as them ndash Irsquom not from a wealthy family, I didnrsquot go to a fancy school, and when I worked for the Tories, I was one of the only people who hadnrsquot gone to boarding school or Oxford. The likelihood is: we probably think a lot alike, I just happen to vote dferently.Tentatively Tory is at PBHs Free Fringe, Waverley Bar, from August  - Geoff NorcottBorn in South London, Geoff Norcott is a comedian and political commentator who has appeared on Radio , Mock the Week and the recent TV documentary, How the Middle Class Ruined Britain, which looked at the effects of gentrication.LOOKING back, I probably had tendencies to be a conservative quite young. I remember hating getting free school dinners and thinking: why am I depending on this thing called The State  My dad was a Labour man and, although we have dferent politics, therersquos a streak in both of us of hating people having power over us. I ask myself: what is it that makes me think like that  My main guiding instinct is I just hate people telling me what to do. Itrsquos not libertarianism, itrsquos just the government staying out of our lives where possible.A lot of comedy is left-wing because there was a backlash against what was seen as the bigotry of some s comedians but not all the comedy of that era was like that ndash a lot was quite playful and family friendly but itrsquos been struck off the register. There was this sort of inherited victory ndash the feeling that the left won the debate in comedy and that went unquestioned for a long time. But whatrsquos punctured that is the Brexit vote because we discovered that itrsquos possible to be left-wing and vote Leave and a lot of people did and yet when you look at the comedy circuit it seemed like nobody did.Comedy audiences arenrsquot necessarily mostly left-wing though. When you go and gig and do tours around the country, itrsquos quite reassuring to find that the vast majority of people are still grown up, whether theyrsquore left or right, leave or remain. Because of the dialogue that happens on social media, you can be persuaded that everyone has lost their sense of humour but I donrsquot think thatrsquos the case. There is a small percentage of people that are like that or are likely to complain at gigs. Some people have a dferent lens on humour and will make a calculation before they decide they can laugh.I think, for some reason, people think right-wing humour must be mean about the vulnerable, but itrsquos not ndash I take issue with the idea that right-wing comedy has to be implicitly mean. Therersquos maybe less subject matter for jokes, partly because the left arenrsquot currently in power. But once you tap a vein, it can be quite a rich one.One of the things people said about the documentary I made was: how can you, as a Conservative, have compassion for people who are going to lose their homes, but hang on a minute: how does being a Conservative preclude compassion  That idea comes from the self-consoling views on the left that their side inherited all the virtue. The leftrsquos argument would be lsquoletrsquos give you a bigger slice of the same-sized piersquo, whereas my argument would be lsquoletrsquos give you the same-sized slice of a much bigger pie. Letrsquos make a bigger pie everybody.rsquo Therersquos something slightly infantile about the left thinking theyrsquore the good guys like theyrsquore in some sort of Marvel franchise where they are the Avengers and everyone  is Thanos.Geoff Norcott: Work in Progress is at Underbelly, Bristo Square from August -.Dominic FrisbyDominic Frisby is a comedian and writer on financial affairs. His book Le After The State argues that government should be much smaller.I WOULD say comedy is institutionally left-wing and a lot of comedians these days avoid politics altogether because they donrsquot want it to affect their work. Therersquos a comedy club near my house ndash I contacted them and I went down and compered. But I was taken off the roster because I voted Leave. Itrsquos the whole country gone mad ndash people will not give you workyou have the wrong political opinions. Itrsquos become so unacceptable to have views that donrsquot conform to the tyranny of the  BBC axis of liberals.Itrsquos a form of suppression and censorship and it goes back to smearing everyone who doesnrsquot agree with you. It goes back to Ben Elton ndash hersquos a great comic, but his generation, in attacking what came before them, they no-ed an entire generation of comics. Benny Hill for example, who was harmless.There is a trend now, though, towards right-wing comedians and Brexit has been the turning point ndash a lot of comedians have come out of the closet. However, therersquos an authoritarian left and its figureheads are Owen Jones [columnist and commentator] and people like that, who say: you cannot think that, you cannot say that. Itrsquos almost like a religion and anyone who utters thoughts that deviate from it are ex-communicated.Comedy audiences also tend to be a certain way. If you ask an audience, lsquowho voted Leave rsquo, it will be   per cent Remain and those who did vote Leave go quiet. Itrsquos because wersquove had left-wing comedy rammed down our throats so it attracts those people and people who donrsquot think that way keep their mouths shut.Libertarian Love Songs is at PBHs Free Fringe, Banshee Labyrinth, from August  -.Konstatin KisinKonstantin Kisin is a Russian-British comedian and a former student at Edinburgh University who made headlines last year by refusing to sign a university behavioural agreement insisted that all humour must be respectful and kind.MY show is about the fact I turned down the behavioural agreement contract which was offered to me, which is a jumping off point for looking at where we are with freedom of expression and censorship and no-ing. I also contrast it with growing up in the Soviet Union ndash Irsquom starting to feel like wersquore heading in that direction.I was shocked to receive the agreement. If Irsquod felt it was an isolated incident that has nothing to do with whatrsquos going on in broader society, I might not have said anything about it, but I turned it down because itrsquos part of a broader change thatrsquos sweeping through society. Wersquore in a world where we think that words are violence and jokes oppress people and saying the wrong thing triggers someonersquos PTSD or whatever and renders them disabled for le. We are starting to take words far too seriously.The left are now the people peddling ideas that donrsquot stand up to scrutiny and the reason they have to suppress free speech is that is the only way to continue advancing all the things they tell us are true, that Britain is a racist, xenophobic place that hates immigrants, that everyone is oppressed, that wersquore all privileged in dferent ways and this is what determines everything ndash all of this nonsense is being spread by the radical left and the reason they donrsquot want to engage in debate is that any examination of the facts immediately contradicts that. The people who want to suppress freedom of expression are people who know theyrsquore wrong.I think there is a kickback happening and rightly so ndash itrsquos almost like wersquove got to a point where wersquove gone so far in one direction, we almost feel: someone had to say something. But I can count the number of people fighting back against this in the comedy world on one hand. Comedy also reflects culture more broadly ndash universities have become more woke and that is leaking out into society. Comedy only mirrors what happens in society and the reason there are a few comedians challenging this stuff is because the progressive, woke narrative is perceived as the establishment and anyone who disagrees is a heretic.My feelings about free speech are not driven by something I read on the internet ndash they are driven by what happened to my family. My grandfather was arrested and exiled from the Soviet Union in  for saying that the invasion of Afghanistan was wrong ndash it was something that everybody thought but you werenrsquot supposed to say. I know just how important freedom of expression is and when I ask audiencesthey think it is more dangerous to say what they think than it was ten years ago, often more than half the audience say yes and that is not a healthy direction of travel.Orwell That Ends Well is at Gilded Balloon Teviot from July  to August "},{"url":null,"title":"go-go-time-welcome-back-scottish-football","story":"If yoursquore not fond of football, fear not. I shall be focusing on the gamersquos epistemological aspects .I love the game, though my late Dad found it deplorable: ldquoTwenty-two grown men chasinrsquo a wee barsquo, ken  Oh, I ken, I ken. And yet hellip there are few things more exciting in le than a goal being scored. Think about it. Two minutes to go. The game drawn so far. One of your chaps picks up the ball on the edge of the box. Come on! You will him on. Please score! He goes past one. He goes past two. He crosses. The big centre-half heads it in. Unalloyed joy! Chaps ndash and many women these days too ndash hugging each other with unerotic elan.On very special occasions, you might see grown men struggling, and in many cases failing, to hold back tears . A crucial goal at the football is way more exciting than anything you encounter at the cinema or in books or even at the bingo. Football isnrsquot one of these daft games where the score is counted in hundreds.That said, these days, the game can be as dull and incomprehensible as cricket. Itrsquos all possession football, passing the ball back and back and, very occasionally, forth. Therersquos much tripe talked about tactics.ldquoHersquos moved from a -- to a --. ldquoHas he, aye All I ever see is chaps wandering around willy-nilly, barring the fact that some are on the left and some on the right, and some up front and some at the back. Tactics  Such a lot of nonsense. Just get the ball booted up the park .One manager said: ldquoThe ball is round ndash itrsquos meant to roll along the ground. No! The ball is round. Itrsquos meant to bounce.However, wersquore straying into the technicalities of the game here so let me bring the discussion,not the ball, back down to the earth of politics, sociology and culture.In the run-up to todayrsquos kick-off, fans have been warned that bad behaviour wonrsquot be tolerated this season, amidst a crackdown on throwing objects, lighting up flares or indulging in sectarian singing.Why anyone would take a flare to a football match is beyond me. They must set off for the games, patting their pockets and going through a checklist: ldquoMatch ticket, wallet, phone, scarf, hat, napkin for half-time pie, flare. Itrsquos like these hooligans setting off up town on a Saturday night, getting to the door and saying: ldquoOops, almost forgot my samurai sword.I suppose flares are supposed to create a visual spectacle, when all they create is a stink and an obscuring of the pitch. Theyrsquore also potentially dangerous but, then, so is eating the pies at some grounds.Therersquos definitely an atavistic element to football crowds. The chanting is like warring tribes of old squaring up for battle, evenI canrsquot imagine Vikings or Picts or whatever singing footballrsquos most prevalent chant: ldquoMy side, cha-cha-cha!Several clubs are upgrading their CCTV systems, which makes me uncomfortable. Irsquove been with away fans and had police filming us all with large cameras, which I regard as an impertinence.At which point, of course, we should all sit back and remind ourselves itrsquos only a game. ldquoIs it, aye  Well, aye, it is. I remain of the view that we should applaud decent passages of play from the other side, unless itrsquos Hearts.We should isolate and shame the coin-throwers and sectarian bigots. And, as I imagine all the singing and shouting must put the teams off, it might be betterwe all remained quiet for a change, allowing the players to concentrate and get on with the game.These are just a few of my ideas that you might like to kick skywards or,you prefer, to pass back and forth. ++++ISNrsquoT technology marvellous  Voice at the back: ldquoNaw! Well, it is but.Itrsquos improving all aspects of our lives, some important, some not so much. Among the most important is getting served at a busy bar. Irsquom better at this than I used to be.In my youth, when I was a shy, dfident loser, I could never get served, partly because I looked at my feet all the time. Irsquom sure I was Finnish in another le .Irsquom also too considerate of other people, letting them in first but, worse still, not wanting to bother the staff or make them uncomfortable: ldquoBut he wonrsquot like being stared at.Now, technology has come to the rescue, with a facial recognition system that logs customers on camera and tells staff the order in which to serve them. Trials of the the coupon scanner indicate that,all Britainrsquos , pubs used it, bar staff could serve an extra  million pints a year.And that can only be good for the nationrsquos morale in these trying times.++++A SHOCK study has found that human toddlers know right from wrong instinctively. American researchers forced infants to watch a teddy bear puppet show in which the ldquowrongdoer took all the toys.When the ldquoleader failed to punish this, the nippers looked on aghast. But when the leader took action, giving toys to any bear who missed out, they looked away, apparently contented that justice had been done.The researchers, led by the University of Illinois, say this proved the bairns were hardwire to expect the leader to right the wrong.But, surely,infants knew right from wrong they wouldnrsquot be pooping in their pants  The implication is supposed to be that, rather than need schooling to learn right from wrong, they know it instinctively and le ndash or other infants ndash knocks it out of them.Hmm. Might make sense, right enough. I was raised a nice little boy, believing the world a happy and decent place, until I went to school. Encountering ruffians and nersquoer-do-wells, I distinctly remember thinking: ldquoThese people are evil nutters. The feeling has stayed with me into adulthood, when I long once more to be the age of four, when all was right with the world.++++PEOPLErsquoS champion Boris Johnson has been subject to unconscionable levels of hostility since being selected as Prime Minister of England and the Other Bits. He was made unwelcome this week when he visited one of the Other Bits, Scotland. But, really, the cruellest blow in a bruising week came when an opinion poll found that only  per cent of punters would be happy at the prospect of his becoming their son-in-law, while  per cent would be sad.That gave a ldquonet happiness rating of minus , his only consolation being that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn scored minus  and Donald Trump minus , though the US president is past his prime.This must have made sobering reading for his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, never mind for her pop. Undaunted, the couple have ordered furnishings from John Lewis for their new Downing Street home, and Boris continues to see the sunny side of le, moving from O to B, that is to say from optimism to boosterism, his new mantra for the economy.Given his Wodehousian mien, one might also say he has moved from Bertie Wooster to Boris Booster."},{"url":null,"title":"bearded-baker-edinburgh-reviewed-ron-mackenna","story":"EdinburghIn the overall scheme of things driving around  miles simply to try a hand-made bagel is probably quite extreme. Especially when that  miles is punctuated by getting lost in Edinburgh, inadvertently parking slap-bang in a no-parking zone, rushing out and moving the car to an expensive parking zone and then discovering that when it comes to early afternoons Irsquom the only bagel customer in town.But Irsquove been emailed about this place from a reader and it is apparently the best bagel in Scotland. So here I am. Alone with my -mile bagel. Occasionally punctuating the silence by asking the woman behind the counter interesting questions such as: is it busier in the morning  Answer: yes and wersquore open early. Is it OK to park out there  Answer: I donrsquot know. Do you use any chemicals when making these bagels  Answer: What  No! Itrsquos not that outrageous a question.In the States where they are somewhat obsessed with the art of bagel-making therersquos a school of thought that says the only way to get that perfect bagel crust is to boil the bagel in lye or sodium hydroxide. Who knew Course, this substance is also used in cleaning materials and can be,handled clumsily ndash more than a tad poisonous. Alternatively therersquos simply boiling the dough in water and perhaps a little malt barley. Or, and this is not definitely seen as a good development, simply ditch the boiling and bake instead in a steam-injected oven.In New York where they make a virtue out of a bagel the unique qualities of the famous native version are put down almost entirely to the properties of the local water. If that sounds a little like the Big Applersquos more famous flim-flam then consider this: in the journey from source to tap not only does their water apparently lie in pipes and storage pools for anything from three months to a year but it is, very unusually for the States, soft. Making it produce, apparently, a saltier and sloppier slack-gluten dough, resulting in NY water, so they say, being dubbed the Goldilocks of Water . Again: who knew How is Edinburghrsquos water  Ah, thatrsquos one question I donrsquot get around to asking in here. The internet actually isnrsquot that good at answering either. Seems like its generally labelled soft to moderate, but probe more deeply and it may not be soft at all but something called permanently hard. Ugh.More importantly, perhaps, how is Edinburghrsquos bagel  Or the Bearded Bakerrsquos  On this last subject I do see a man with a beard bustle in and out of a neat and tidy little baking area at the back of this clean little store-front cafe. When I scan a Twitter feed from the Edinburgh Restaurant Awards on my phone it looks like the same guy who was picking up the cafe of the year award. But you know beards. They can be deceptive. So I donrsquot chase after him.Refreshingly perhaps therersquos not a word of the usual self-promoting we-are-the-greatest literature to be seen in here. Therefore, itrsquos simply down to taste.One final point. When it comes to bagels therersquos no greater American insult than to describe one as being simply bread with a hole in it. Is this  Thatrsquos the question on my lips anyway as I heft, and frankly there is a bit of heft to this, my bagel upwards.Itrsquos a shiny brown on the outside, crusted with so many poppy seeds it almost has a blue sheen, itrsquos also unevenly round with the handmade feel that everyone seems to be looking for these days and with a bite it cracks and crunches and yields into a mild chewiness.Is it technically flawless  I dunno. But sliced and filled with pastrami, gruyere, sauerkraut and mustard mayo it satisfies me. Though maybe not enough to warrant another -mile round trip.The Bearded Baker Rodney StreetEdinburgh  Menu: Bagels and doughnuts. I had a cinnamon bun, too, but mainly bagels. All made with that hand-crafted, wholly wholesome touch.  Service: There wasnrsquot anyone  in but me and the service was fine, though they could blow their own trumpet a bit more.  Price: A few pence short of a fiver for a fully-filled, hand-crafted, possibly the best in Scotland, bagel. On their own theyrsquore considerably cheaper.  Atmosphere: Itrsquos all go in the mornings and they open at the crack of dawn, well .am, but way sleepy in the afternoon.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months. Installing #met masts# would allow data to be gathered which could be critical in determining how we move forward with the project.”For more information visit the Planning Application Search and Submission page on the OIC website• For the Quanterness planning application search for   PP.• For the Hoy planning application search for   PP.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon.

Has he passed this information on to the PSNI who are investigating this crime \"SDLP MLA Sinead Bradley said Mr Wells should provide whatever information he knows about the incident to police.“It is astounding that the DUP MLA suggested the locks had been ‘adjusted’ as those responsible broke into the water tower in Rathfriland. Either you support the rule of law or you don’t. Jim needs to make up his mind,\" the South Down MLA “I also note that Mr Wells claims to have spoken with those responsible. Given that a complaint has been made to police about this incident, the DUP should provide this information to the police to assist with an investigation.\"The DUP has been approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures thousands turn out for belfast pride parade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Her family and friends then began an epic Save Our Sunflower Campaign, appealing to the Northern Ireland public to sign up to donate their stem cells in an effort to save her le.Despite the fact that she was told that finding a match was very rare, yesterday Sharon got the miracle she prayed hard for.\"It is just fantastic,\" she said. \"I just cant believe it. I havent stopped crying all day. But its all good. Its all happy tears.\"I am in the City Hospital today getting chemotherapy and I was down getting an x-ray. When I went back up to the room I had a missed call on my phone. It was Dublin calling and I dont know anyone down there so I thought it was the hospital phoning me. I thought that it must be bad news. I rang it back and then I hung up because I was on my own andit was bad news then I didnt think I would be able to talk to them.\"I got scared. I phoned my husband Alan and I asked himhe got a missed call too, and he checked and he did. So I knew then it was them. He rang them and it was engaged. My nerves were wrecked.\"He eventually texted me to say that he got through and did I want him to tell me now or wait until he came to the hospital. I thought that didnt sound too good.\"So I sat on the edge of my bed with one of the other girls here in the ward. And we were so nervous. And he came in the door with a big cheesy smile on his face and he said you got a nine out of  [match], Sharon and I just couldnt believe it. I started to cry. I wasnt expecting that at all.\"Sharon says that a full match would be a  out of , as would be the casestem cells were from a sibling. She said it is a \"true miracle\".\"A nine out of  is the closest Im going to get,\" she said. \"After being told that I have little chance worldwide of getting a match. I dont know anything about this person who has saved my le. I have just been told that I have to go down for a consultation in Dublin.\"I have just done my third chemo in the City Hospital and I will be here for another couple of weeks still until my bloods start to come up. I have to go to Dublin on August  for a consultation and, all being well, they are going to start me on the really intense chemo on August . Then Ill be getting the stem cells on September .\"I cant believe that this has happened. I would never have thought that it would come to this. You always hear of these things and think God love that woman, she never got anyone in the end, but to get that news that it worked, its amazing.\"I have a chart beside my bed where I record my temperature and things. I had a high temperature this morning and I put a sad face beside it. But then this afternoon I was filling it in and put I got a donor and a smiley face on it. It feels amazing. I have got so many messages from people, its just brilliant. Its overwhelming.\"Sharon acknowledges she still has a \"mountain to climb\".\"The intense chemo I am to get is very high risk. And there is a graft versus host disease to contend with, which is when the stem cells belonging to someone  go into your body and recognise they are in the wrong body and start attacking your organs. But the doctors give you medicine to stop it. I have a big hill to climb before the easy part comes. But there is light at the end of the tunnel.\"I am just over the moon, words cant explain how I feel at the minute. Things were looking very bad there and this is like someone has given me a chance of le again. This person has saved my le and I dont even know who they are.\"Sharon said she will be eternally grateful to all who signed up to stem cell donation since her sunflower campaign began.For details visit Save Our Sunflower Campaign on Facebook"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts traffic and travel arrangements for belfast pride parade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

On Thursday, Mr Smith revealed there is a photograph of the Queen in his private office at Stormont House.That same day, the DUP urged him to reinstate a portrait of the Queen, with party leader Arlene Foster saying it was \"ridiculous\" that it had been removed.The partys East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson said yesterday it was encouraging that Mr Smith was now going to get to grips with the issue. He added: \"It is important that the Secretary of State conducts the internal review which he has now committed to. \"It is entirely appropriate that as Her Majestys Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he would see no dficulty with portraits of the Queen being displayed here in Belfast. \"We should ensure that displays such as Her Majesty are able to take place, recognising the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. \"In other embassies and government buildings across the world, there will be pictures of the Head of State on display. \"This is appropriate and such a display should therefore be the same for Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.\"Ulster Unionist peer Lord Rogan had tabled a number of questions at Westminster seeking further answers from the NIO regarding the payout.But Lord Rogan says answers he has received over the removal of the royal portraits simply raise more questions, not least why Stormont House should be treated dferently to NIO HQ in London and Hillsborough Castle.\"Stormont House is the official HQ of the NIO locally and it is therefore only fitting that portraits of Her Majesty should be on display there to both reflect and respect the constitutional reality of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"This situation should never have been allowed to happen and is the result of meek and weak leadership within the NIO which must be brought to a swt end\". The NIO employee had allegedly claimed under human rights legislation that it was unfair for him to have to work in a location in which he could be offended by the royal portraits.It is understood that the portraits were replaced with a photograph of the Queen meeting the late Sinn Fein leader, and former Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.But it emerged this week that all the paintings had since been taken down and replaced with landscapes. Responding to the controversy for the first time, a Sinn Fein spokesperson said yesterday: \"Since its creation, the six county state has been awash with symbols of the British and unionist identity. \"The Irish identity was deliberately erased from the official narrative.\"That imbalance needs to be fully addressed, not only in terms of the Irish nationalist identity, but in recognition of the ever-increasing ersity of this society. \"Where balance cannot be achieved, a neutral space should be the default option to ensure that no-one feels intimidated or uncomfortable.\"The Equality Commission has said a portrait of the Queen is not considered by it to be a sensitive item for display in a workplace in its guidelines. However, chief commissioner Michael Wardlow said the context of how it was displayed was key and could possibly lead to causing offence and disrupting workplace harmony.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected.

However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos.

The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

Then he said there were royal portraits in Hillsborough Castle, and that Northern Ireland enjoyed many royal visits.He also said he recognised “the importance of the NIO being an open and inclusive place to work”.So what was he saying  That royalty, royal images and visits are part of the cultural hinterland at the NIO, as you might expect in Her Majesty’s government  Or that the NIO interprets ‘inclusivity’ to mean that such imagery is a problem  If he is not saying the latter, why cite inclusivity Then, around the same time that we revealed further details of this shambles, and Mr Smith’s inept response, it emerged that the NIO had lost a key advisor, Jonathan Caine.Lord Caine, as he has been since , has been an advisor on Northern Ireland matters to two prime ministers since , David Cameron and Theresa May, and four secretaries of state Owen Paterson, Theresa Villiers, James Brokenshire and Karen Bradley.But his experience is greater than the last nine years of Tory rule. He was involved in the party in the s, when he advised the NI secretaries Peter Brooke and Patrick Mayhew, prior to Tony Blair taking officein .It is essential that NIO ministers have this sort of high level advice from people who know what is going on, and have an institutional memory of politics in the Province.\"  \"  Ben Lowry: Cyprus gang rape case is reminder that fake claims can happen and the need for jurors to be aware of that possibility Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In Lord Caine’s case, such NI experience is unrivalled in Westminster or the Tory Party, yet he has not been kept on by Mr Smith.In case any unionists have somehow not yet noticed, we are deep in crisis on a range of issues: cultural, constitutional, historical and legal.The Irish government is increasingly adopting a joint stewardship approach to Northern Ireland.Lord Caine is one of few people,not the only person, who tried to push back against this from a moderate unionist perspective.That is not to say his advice was always listened to. Patently, and regrettably, it wasn’t. There are competing voices and a long-standing culture of deference to Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs .As this column noted last week, NIO ministers will now almost never so much as verbally challenge the relentlessly partisan Irish. In the past, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers sometimes challenged it. Mr Smith urgently needs an experienced voice who will explain to him when joint statements with Simon Coveney are appropriate, and when they are not. A voice who will tell him when to ignore demands ofhis senior officials or of Dublin.That voice is now gone.Alarmingly, I understand that Lord Caine at times tried to resist Irish overreach in ious talks, and their failure to observe the three strands, which dictate when Irish input is apt, but did not always find unionist politicians inclined to take a robust stance .One immediate way to lay down a marker is to reinstate the NIO portraits, and face down complaint.A further is to make clear that London will pursue legacy cases, such as funding civil actions against terrorists and setting up inquiries, given that republicans are relentlessly chasing the past and Ireland has tried to humiliate the UK at both the Strasbourg human rights court and the Council of Europe . Another is to insist that the talks process faithfully uphold the three stranded approach and to observe the constitutional proprieties of Dublin’s role. Meanwhile, now that Boris Johnson is styling himself minister for the Union, he could perhaps now draw on Lord Caine’s experience.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Cyprus gang rape case is reminder that fake claims can happen• Ben Lowry last week: Julian Smith needs to reverse NIO weaknessJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      lsquoFor me, becoming a drag queen was definitely a callingrsquoUlster drag queen Delishus O#Toole talks about swimming the River Lfey in a ballgown and climbing a mountain in her underwear for a cause close to her heart.

By Helen McGurkBelfast city centre will have a carnival-like atmosphere today, with flamboyant costumes, extravagant floats, music, rainbow-coloured flags and general fabulousness, as tens of thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and their supporters, take part in the annual Pride parade. Among those dipping a diamanté heel into the festivities will be Delishus O’Toole, drag queen extraordinaire, singer-songwriter, animal rights supporter and all-round rising star.The resolutely glamorous Delishus, said: ‘‘I am really, really excited about Pride. It’s going to be amazing - I’m keeping what I’m wearing a secret, but it’s going to be fabulous.’’.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button She adds: ‘‘Belfast Pride gets bigger and bigger every year. There’s more people from Northern Ireland going to the event because they totally understand what it’s all about and they think it’s a very important cause to keep supporting. ‘‘It’s a great day. I see it as a celebration of where the LGBT community have come from and I would love, when I am a pensioner, that ‘coming out’ isn’t a thing - you wouldn’t have to come out to your parents - you’d just say ‘this is my girlfriend or boyfriend’, and that would be fine.’’Delishus believes there has been a definite liberalisation ofsocietal attitudes towards the LGBT community here in recent times, but says more could be achieved.‘‘The LGBT community has come a long way from what it was  years ago. It is a lot more accepted in Northern Ireland than it ever has been and I have seen such huge changes. I see -year-olds holding hands on the street and I think that wouldn’t have happened for me  years ago. ‘‘But I think more education is needed. I still think there are people who don’t understand the community and I think the more these iniduals learn more about it, the better.’’ Delishus, who describes herself as ‘ going on ’, is guarded about her identity, saying only: ‘‘I grew up in Belfast - the normal me is a very boring person. There’s nothing glamorous about me as a real person - all the glamour is about Delishus.’’And when this ‘normal’ Belfast man gets all dolled up with the make-up, the wig, the sequins and the stilettos, he becomes his alter ego, Delishus, a strutting, hyper-feminine goddess.‘‘I become a a, the singer, the artist. I become this confident figure where anything’s possible.‘‘ A lot of drag queens will tell you that when they put the outfit on, they become a character - they become a massive extension of who they really are as a person. Some people who are really, really shy become really out there. I become extremely colourful.’’\"  \"  : War looms as British fleet gets dramatic order to seize Spanish ships Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Reflecting on how the drag act took off, she says: ‘‘I always had dreams of being a singer so I learnt how to sing and went for singing lessons. As I got older I realised that being a drag queen was a calling because every time I performed somewhere people said ‘you sound like a woman - you should be a drag queen, you’ve got the look, you’ve got a pretty face’.‘‘In the early years I performed at very small gigs, then I broke into drag and it all took off for me and it was after doing Belfast Pride  dressed up like Mariah Carey that all the gigs came in and everything changed for me.’’At the moment she has plans to release a record and there are rumours of a TV show appearance and neither have her talents haven’t gone unnoticed in the celebrity circuit, with TV star Rylan heaping praise on her. ‘‘I did a talent iety show in London and Rylan was very supportive of myself and my act and he said ‘you should be in London performing, what are you doing in Belfast ’’But, although Delishus is happy to gig there, she won’t be upping sticks to the neon-soaked streets of London any time soon. ‘‘I love living in Northern Ireland. I just couldn’t leave everyone - family is very important to me. My family are very supportive they keep me grounded as a person. My mum and dad give me advice and I am very lucky that they accept me for who I am because there are so many people who are not accepted by their families, for whatever reason.’’Underneath the pancake and the glitz, Delishus is a passionate campaigner for animal rights. Just recently she swam across the River Lfey in Dublin to highlight the lack of Government action on recent revelations that , greyhounds are killed each year for not being fast enough. She gets emotional talking on the subject. ‘‘I was completely and utterly disturbed by what these poor greyhounds are going through, they are unwanted or they’ve got too old to race and are exterminated in such a horrible way. It’s disgusting and I thought I had to get involved. We need to wake up everybody that this can’t go on. ‘‘These animals have feelings, these animals have emotions and it is just barbaric what is happening to them.’’A lot of people turned up to cheer Delishus on in her swim.‘‘The Lfey’s not as easy as it looks when you swim from one side to the other in a big ball gown. ‘‘I was smiling and waving at everybody but I was getting dragged by the current and it was freezing as well.’’She is also due to climb Cave Hill in September, wearing only her underwear and high heels as part of thesponsored ‘Wunderwear Walk.All money raised will go to Lucy’s Trust, who aim to save Northern Ireland’s dogs from needless euthanasia.try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"simon hamilton strong desire for orderly brexit","story":"Posted on Friday August  by John Mulgrew Former jobs minister Simon Hamilton says there is a strong desire to achieve “an orderly Brexit” to avoid long term damage to the economy, as he takes up his new role as head of Belfast Chamber.Mr Hamilton, a former DUP MLA who held several ministerial posts at Stormont – including as Economy Minister – said % of its members backed the initial Withdrawal Agreement, and he will work with them to support a soft exit from the EU.“There’s a desire to make sure there wasn’t a clf edge, and it doesn’t have a detrimental effect on business,” he said. “Belfast Chamber members say they support an orderly Brexit – it’s a common sense place to be.”“… they are pragmatic.
