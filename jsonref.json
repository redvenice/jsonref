Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"from the minute the trial started until it was over it was all about him mother of nadine lott","story":"A collage of family photographs of Nadine Lott and family members. Photograph: Nick BradshawClaire Lott often finds herself arranging memories of her daughter, Nadine. Simple ones. The girl whose laugh prompted the laughter of others. The woman who would never leave home without make-up, even if only for a run, and who was devoted to her own daughter, Kya – “the love of her life”.Or the memories of the woman who, with a heart-shaped birthmark, literally wore her heart on her sleeve.In October 2019, two months before she died, Claire brought Nadine to Rome to celebrate her 30th birthday. There, as the summer waned, they sat and talked about “anything and everything”.“Nadine would tell you everything,” Claire remembers. There, she confided that she was at a point in her life where a relationship was not a primary concern for her. “She said: ‘I’m actually so happy in my life now, I don’t need anybody.’“She loved her job, her car, her apartment, she was so proud of everything she had achieved. She had been approached to do some modelling. Everything was right.” Life was filled with promise.But these memories are often overshadowed by darker thoughts from the three days when her daughter fought for her life, savagely beaten by her former partner, Daniel Murtagh, to the point where she was unrecognisable.“You try to put those away,” her mother explains.Less than two years after the attack, she sat and she listened in Court 19 of the Criminal Courts of Justice as the Chief State Pathologist, Linda Mulligan, detailed each of the 64 injuries to her daughter’s “tiny” frame.The evidence, including details of the blood spattered kitchen, was heard within “touching distance” of the man who had carried out this brutal, primal attack. “This is my daughter you are talking about. It was so cold and factual,” she says.‘The Monster’Next Friday marks the second anniversary of Nadine Lott’s death. She died three days after the grotesquely violent attack in her Arklow home at the hands of Murtagh, her former partner. Kya, then just six, witnessed it all.During the “total carnage”, Kya had screamed at and begged her father to stop and “not to kill her mummy”, but Murtagh had carried on. Kya had seen the devil at work, Claire Lott later told the court.His name is never uttered today in the Lott household. “We don’t mention him ever,” she says. “If he has to be mentioned, he is referred to as ‘The Monster’. He is never referenced by name. We don’t consider what he is doing, where he is, what he was. He is gone,” she says.In June 2012, Nadine travelled to Australia with friends on a year’s working holiday. Her mother was “heartbroken” to see her go, but would not have tried to discourage her. Her daughter did well there as a beautician.She had few boyfriends before she had the “dreadful misfortune” of meeting Murtagh in Darwin, the capital city of Australia’s vast Northern Territory. Initially, she told only her confidante and younger sister Phoebe (26) about the Clondalkin man. She told her mother later.Claire characterises their relationship as a “holiday romance”.“We wouldn’t have known anything about his background as she met him in Australia and his family is not from around here.“We are very trusting as a family and we rely on each other a lot and Nadine had a very trusting nature. She probably inherited that because we would have trusted at face value initially what we saw and that was to our detriment,” says Claire ruefully.In June 2013, Nadine returned home. She had become pregnant shortly after meeting Murtagh. The window-fitter followed her home a few months later and, when their daughter Kya was born, they moved into an apartment together.Things did not work out, however.“They lasted a very short time together. It was a holiday romance and when they got home the holiday was over and Nadine was pregnant. When he came home it dwindled very quickly,” says Claire.“They had had a baby together and she wanted to have the perfect family unit. She was doing what she could to make that work but within months it was all over.”In 2016, Nadine made a last attempt to save the relationship: “She didn’t have feelings for him, but I think she thought: ‘We have a baby together, we will try one last time.’ And she really did try,” she says.However, it ended when Murtagh failed to turn up at the house which Nadine had, with difficulty, rented for them. “She said she wasn’t upset about him and didn’t care about him. It was more a pride thing, she had been let down and everybody could see it.”Despite going separate ways, Nadine still wanted her daughter to have a relationship with her father. “Nadine wanted him to have a relationship with Kya more than he wanted to have a relationship with Kya,” Claire believes.Nadine’s biggest achievement in life was Kya and the mother she became, her mother says. Nadine’s birthing partner in November 2013 was her sister Phoebe, not Murtagh. Phoebe, not Murtagh, took the first photographs of mother and baby.During all of the time, Claire recalls that her daughter “never, ever, ever” told her that she loved Murtagh. “Even after having Kya, she never once said: ‘I love him.’ She always just said: ‘He is funny.’“He was a very insignificant part of our lives.”ControlJust under two weeks before the brutal assault, Nadine told Murtagh in a WhatsApp message not to “threaten” her and that “nothing is ever going to happen between us again, I want to make that clear.”With hindsight, Murtagh clearly had tried to control her daughter, Claire believes: “At the time we wouldn’t have looked at it as controlling. But he was trying to have everything on his terms.”He would promise to visit Kya and not show up. Money for Nadine had to be handed over personally: “He had to be in control. We always felt he wanted to see Nadine more than he wanted to see Kya. Kya was just his way of seeing Nadine.”Murtagh disliked Nadine seeing anyone else, even though they were not together: “Nadine did have to keep things from him even though they were no longer together. She would just say: ‘It’s easier, I don’t have to put up with the grief.’“Nadine was dating a Turkish guy and the next day she got a text to say: ‘So you were out on a date. I think I’ll go and get my hair done with a Turkish barber,’” Claire recalls. “He was letting her know that he knew she had been out with this guy. That was regular.”Despite her feelings, Nadine never criticised Murtagh in front of Kya. “Nadine never gave out about him if he never came to Arklow or never turned up. Nadine would make an excuse for him, she would do anything to make it easier for Kya to accept.”Murtagh had not been violent before the fatal attack, her mother insists: “Nadine was very open. Even if she would not have admitted it to me as her mother, if she was trying to protect me she definitely would have said it to Phoebe or her friends.”It never entered Claire’s mind that she would face such carnage when she went into her daughter’s apartment after a frantic phone call from a neighbour: “We literally thought Nadine would be sitting there with one stab wound. And he would have run and she would have been upset. That’s what I went up to deal with and what I was preparing for.”The Lotts will never know exactly what happened after she returned home from a family night out in a local Arklow pub. Murtagh had been babysitting Kya, having earlier attended her school recital and nativity play. Consequently, he was staying the night.At about 4am, Nadine’s friend and neighbour Amela Kulenovic found Murtagh “vicious with rage” and making a “growling noise” as he rained blows on his ex-partner as she lay on the living room floor. He was “going ape” and “like a wild animal”, Kulenovic later told gardaí.Before the attack, Nadine had changed into her pyjamas, neatly folding the dress worn on the night out. “I have so much in my head but I’ll never know what happened. I have a million opinions, a million scenarios and a million sounds,” her mother says.Murtagh fled after the attack, driving away in his Volvo. Thirty kilometres away, in Laragh, he crashed into a ditch, suffering minor injuries. A motorist stopped to help, only to be told by Murtagh that he had “killed my wife because she was with my friend”.InjuriesToday, Claire Lott believes that the “extreme and grotesque” injuries inflicted on Nadine’s face – which had separated flesh from bone – were utterly deliberate. “Without a doubt,” she says.Pointing from her neck to the top of her head, Claire goes on: “When I saw Nadine, everything was focused from here up. Everything was destroyed beyond recognition. Not only did she not look like Nadine, she didn’t look human either.“For all of that to have happened before she had even got into hospital and before the swelling had started to take place. Her head and face were destroyed. It was just a mess,” she says.Gda Supt Declan McCarthy, who headed the murder investigation, said he had never seen such violence in his 40 years of service, a view echoed by doctors. Her injuries were so catastrophic that she never regained consciousness.Claire brought some of her daughter’s belongings to put beside her hospital bed – a photo of Nadine, her wash-bag, her perfume and pictures of Kya: “I wasn’t sure what sort of damage was going to be there when she woke up.“Pictures help with memories and I thought if she had all these pictures around her, she would get comfort when she wakes up,” says Claire, who believed her daughter would recover consciousness, despite the injuries and the need for 42 pints of blood.“As a mother you hope against hope. Visually, you are seeing one thing but you just hope that the injuries are almost superficial and deep down there can be a healing and she would come out of it. I just wanted her back, it didn’t matter what form I got her back in.“I knew it would be a long recovery. I thought we were in for months of recovery before we even got to healing. I thought we were going to need plastic surgery. Those were the thoughts that were going through my head.“Even when they were taking her down for the last brain scan, I still was sitting in the chair thinking: ‘Come on Nadine, show them there is a little bit of you there. Just give them something that they can work with.’” She died on December 17th, 2019, at 3.16pm.‘His show’Today, Claire Lott\u0026nbspbelieves her daughter’s identity got lost during the trial: “From the minute the trial started until it was over, it was all about him. We referenced it as ‘his show’. He felt like he was running the show.”Her daughter’s voice, she says, was not heard until a victim-impact statement was read at the sentence hearing in October, when Murtagh received the mandatory term of life imprisonment for murder.“That’s why it was so important for us to do it as a family,” she says.Claire Lott attended every day of the three-week trial, bar the two days when Murtagh’s final video interview with gardaí was played to the jury. “I stayed at home with Kya. I didn’t want to be there to listen to him boasting about what he had done,” she says.In it, the 34-year-old boxer told of the “pounding” he inflicted, sitting forward in his chair as he did so, punching his fist into the palm of his other hand. He told, too, of how he used a tyre pump charger, with its wire wrapped around his knuckles for a solid punch.He lied throughout, she says, about his claims to gardaí that Nadine had been seeing someone else and when he claimed they were “kind of back together for the past three months, on and off”.“He never thought he would get convicted of murder, he thought he would be found guilty of manslaughter. At no point did he actually believe or did his family believe that he would be found guilty of murder.“He honestly believed that the jury would be on his side. I think he is so self-centred and egotistical that he thought people would believe what came out of his mouth,” she says, noting that he had called Nadine his “future wife” in his last interview.“She was neither his girlfriend nor his wife. They were amicable for a child and that was it. In her texts to him, she was being as nice as she could be but it didn’t mean she even liked him,” Claire insists.Nadine’s mother was repulsed by Murtagh’s demeanour in the courtroom, especially when he would blow kisses down to his mother from the dock before he went into the cells each evening.There has never been an apology from him.“One day we were leaving court and we had just seen the most graphic pictures of Nadine’s blood and drag stains all over the apartment. And his mother shouted up to him: ‘I love you.’ How can a woman sit and look at what is being done to another woman and then portray her love?”“That made it even harder for us because I, Phoebe, Tanith, Kyle, David, none of us could look up at Nadine and shout: ‘We love you. We will see you later. We will call you at seven.’ They thought this was okay to do.”Pain and griefToday, Nadine is talked about every day by the Lotts, to keep her memory alive for Kya.Hundreds of people attended a vigil for her in Arklow, her hometown: “She would never pass anyone without saying hello, she would always help someone out if needed help, she would never see anyone stuck,” Phoebe says.This month, the Lotts’ priority is to give eight-year-old Kya, who is looking forward to Santa, the best memories of Christmas possible, even though December is the month when she had to say “goodbye to her mammy”.“But the reality is that Kya will say herself that not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about that night. She says ‘Why my mummy’ and tells us how hard it is to be the only person in her class who doesn’t have a mummy,” Claire says.“We talk about Nadine like she is still here. It’s almost like she will walk in the door. Like she was here yesterday and is coming back. Then you are driving the car and you get this overwhelming pain and grief like you are actually going to go insane.“And then your brain switches off and even if you wanted to keep the crying going you can’t. You live in 2019 and in those couple of weeks before Nadine passed where everything was fine. That’s where you live.”The Nadine Lott Trust Fund has been set up in Nadine’s memory and as a secure fund for Kya’s benefit throughout her life. Contributions can be made through Bank of Ireland in Arklow, or through Pádraig J Hyland \u0026amp Co Solicitors, Arklow.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds turned away from ucd vaccination centre amid high demand for boosters","story":"Hundreds of people seeking booster shots have been turned away from the Covid-19 vaccination centre at UCD after the queue reached maximum capacity by 9.30am. Video: Ronan McGreevyMore than 500 people were in the queue at UCD by 9am for a Covid-19 booster vaccination on Saturday. Photograph: Alan BetsonHundreds who turned up for their booster shot at UCD on Saturday morning were turned away because of long queues and delays on the university campus.The UCD Gerard Manly Building vaccination centre was due to open its doors at 9am, but such was the queue that it opened at 7.50am. The centre is administering booster vaccines to those aged between 50 and 69 and healthcare workers.UCD site manager Hugh Kane said there were already more than 50 people in the queue when he arrived at 6.45am. There are 10 booths in operation with a capacity of 120 an hour.By 9.15am, there were 472 people awaiting the booster, according to Mr Kane’s headcount. Anyone else who arrived after this time was turned away while those at the back of the queue were told they would have to wait four hours to get their booster vaccination.“We are not in a position to take anybody else at this stage as we have booked appointments in the afternoon,” he said.Long queues were also reported at City Hall in Cork and at the CityWest vaccination centre in Dublin. There were queues at the vaccination centre in Kilkenny city an hour before it was due to open at 9am.Early arrivals at UCD waited for two hours to get vaccinated. “I was here on Thursday and I was turned away so I was there at 7.30am,” said Maura Lynch. “There was about 150 people in front of me. It’s a relief to get my booster shot.”Blanaid Mehigan complained that an official said her vaccination certificate could not be read. “He let 20 people through when I was queuing. A girl who is going to Argentina was out by a day was turned away. I don’t understand it. It’s a bloody flu shot,” said Ms Mehigan.Many people who thought they had arrived early were turned away. “I’m frustrated. This is clearly not working properly,” said Karen O’Sullivan, who arrived just after 9am.“We are being criticised for not taking the flu shot, yet you can see the enthusiasm and the commitment here today. I don’t mind two hours waiting, but to wait and be told it is not going to happen is disappointing.”Contact tracingAsked about contact tracing among passengers arriving into Irish airports over the coming weeks, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said all passengers on flights with a confirmed case of the Omicron variant which has arrived from a designated country of concern will be contact traced under new public health measures updated by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.If a case of Covid-19 that is not suspected to be Omicron is confirmed on a flight arriving from one of these designated countries, passengers within two rows in all directions of the inidual with the virus will be contacted traced, he said.If there are two non-Omicron suspected cases, the whole flight will be contract traced, he said. The same measures will be in place if one case of the Omicron variant is detected.Asked whether some visitors could end up stuck in quarantine for Christmas, Mr Reid urged the public to stay tuned to Government messaging on the issue.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"women of honour not happy with independent review terms of reference","story":"The terms presented by the department of defence had not been reviewed independently, said retired company quartermaster Sgt Karina Molloy. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe Women of Honour group has said it is “not happy” with the Government’s draft terms of reference for an independent review into allegations of bullying, sexual abuse and harassment in the defence forces.“We have a responsibility to once and for all bring about radical change and to root out the systemic toxic culture in the defence forces. This system won’t do it, this review won’t do it,” Ms Molloy told Katie Hannon, the broadcaster behind RTÉ’s Women of Honour documentary which aired earlier this year. “We’re saying why don’t you skip the independent review, and go straight to the commission of inquiry with full statutory investigation powers,” said Ms Molloy. “That’s what we wanted. Why waste tax payers money on a review.”Ms Molloy said the group had expected to see an “independent facilitator” brought in to oversee the terms of reference of the inquiry and that all stakeholders, including Women of Honour, would be brought in to “workshop” these terms of reference. However, the terms presented by the department of defence had not been reviewed independently, she said. Under the current terms, witnesses will not be “compelled” to give evidence, added Ms Molloy. “The problem is we want them to delve into what happens after the victims put in their complaint... once again they are protecting themselves as a department and they’re also protecting the perpetrator.“We’re being allowed to tell our stories but they’re not investigating as to what went wrong with the investigation and how to rectify it, how to stem out the toxic culture.”Questions must be asked as to “how did the victim get re-victimised”, she added. ‘Sticking point’Ms Molloy acknowledged that the Minister for Defence Simon Coveney had contacted the group on Friday, stating that the women could now bring legal advisors to meetings on the review process. “That had been a sticking point because he said that this is not a legal process, that we are not changing any legislation here,” said Ms Molloy. “We are thankful that he has changed his position in allowing us to bring in our legal advisor and we welcome the chance of going into the room again to bring things forward.”Ms Molloy said the group would continue to engage with the department on the inquiry because it wanted to ensure “radical change” happens. “We’ve made it clear to the minister and the secretary general with correspondence over the past four weeks that we weren’t happy with their proposed terms of reference and we felt we were getting nowhere, we were being railroaded into an express train that we didn’t want to get on.”Asked to comment on the group’s concerns, a spokeswoman for the department of defence said it had shared draft terms of reference on October 21st with “the relevant stakeholders for an independent review into the matters brought to light by the Women of Honour Group”. “At this stage in the process the Department has received feedback from all stakeholders other than this Women of Honour Group,” the spokeswoman said. “We are keen to progress the review without delay and would welcome the continued engagement and to meet the Women of Honour group.” “Further meetings, including facilitated meetings, have been offered by the department.

Which can only mean the other third have not been paying attention. Just to bring you up to speed, in case you fall into that category: the Prime Minister knew absolutely nothing about a Christmas party that definitely didn’t happen in Downing Street on December 18 last year.“How could it have happened when Christmas parties weren’t allowed due to Covid?” I hear you cry. Well, quite, that is precisely why it didn’t. Just as Owen Patterson did not commit any breaches of lobbying rules and just as Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman. Nothing whatsoever to see here. Just a nice baby girl, born to Johnson’s wife Carrie this week. Can’t we just focus on that?But here’s the curious part: although this party didn’t take place, Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s former press secretary, was filmed laughing about it anyway in a video that was leaked to ITV News. Which was somewhat unfortunate for all those who had insisted it never took place. Obviously Stratton had to resign from her current job, for laughing about a party that didn’t happen. The country, meanwhile, has kept itself busy sharing jokes and memes about what has inevitably now been called Christmas partygate. One wag on Twitter suggested Labour refer to the Tories from here on in as simply “The Christmas Party.” Another said of Johnson’s apparent non-attendance at the party that didn’t take place:Yes, it has been a rich seam to mine, and if we didn’t laugh we’d be crying as we asked ourselves in disbelief how a man who seemed so trustworthy at the outset, so clearly guided by a strict moral code, could have let us down so badly. I’m talking about Dominic Cummings, by the way, who has been sticking the knife in with contributions like this one below, which doesn’t seem in the Christmas spirit at all, since he seems to be implying these non-existent parties actually happened:The public has drawn its own conclusions on the matter. They firmly believe Johnson, as should we all:Some even expressed their support by comparing him to their favourite television comedians, such as Kathy Burke...But if, despite all the copper-bottomed assurances that no party or parties took place and no rules were broken, at least we know the very best officers have been assigned to the case.

Not the one by Edward Gibbon, but rather that by Evelyn Waugh. In particular I have been thinking of a strange scene at the end of the novel where Waugh suddenly introduces a serious note to his comedy.In his first novel Waugh already exercises his trademark gleeful malevolence towards the fate of his characters. All are picked up and spun through the most vicious cycles. But there is also a curious character, a sinister architect, who towards the novel’s close suddenly says something wise. Professor Silenus, is watching a ride in an amusement park when Paul Pennyfeather comes upon him.Silenus explains the fairground attraction they are watching. For five francs the punters go into a room with tiers of seats, and in the centre is a great revolving floor that spins everyone around quickly.At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. “It’s great fun.”Pennyfeather wonders whether this is much like life.“Oh, but it is” says Silenus. “You see, the nearer you can get to the hub of the wheel the slower it is moving and the easier it is to stay on.“There’s generally someone in the centre who stands up and sometimes does a sort of dance. Often he’s paid by the management, though, or, at any rate, he’s allowed in free. Of course at the very centre there’s a point completely at rest, if one could only find it.”I’m sure I don’t need to extrapolate to readers why this passage has been on my mind. This week has included an especially horrible turn of the wheel. And the fairground attraction of Boris’s Number 10 suddenly seems to have lost all of its amusement value. It can even turn a party into a portion of the horrible, destructive game.Earlier this week the front pages blazed out images of the weeping Allegra Stratton, made to carry the can for Number 10.Stratton was hired away by Number 10 a year ago from her highly successful career in the media. She never even spent a day in the job she was hired to do, but was instead shunted aside (some say on the insistence of the Prime Minister’s wife) and given the booby prize of the Cop26 summit. Now she has been thrown off completely.When the footage was leaked showing her laughing with others at Number 10 over how to answer certain questions it was especially ugly because so many people in the media and politics had worked with Stratton, yet helped speed this cycle along.They pretended that Stratton had been laughing at the public, when she had been doing no such thing. But the outrage spin-cycle is so attractive. Everybody wants to be a part of, and make it go faster and faster until it throws them off in turn.To a great extent it is not just Number 10 but the whole political and media world in this country that is now stuck on this destructive ride with not a still point anywhere. Every hour we see another bizarre turn. Sometimes it takes out someone in politics.Sometimes it takes out someone in the media.Last week the BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan was clinging onto his job because some tweets of his from a decade earlier resurfaced. A few days later and the Prime Minister’s former girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri is being sued by the broadcaster Andrew Neil. Sometimes the wheel throws off one person. Sometimes people manage to cling on. It is all very distracting, certainly.And that is what brings to mind the speech of Professor Silenus. He feels, indeed hopes, that he might be near the still point himself. But there is a problem with getting there.Professional men get in the way, he says. Worse is that “Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again. How they all shriek and giggle! And then there are those who sit as far out as they can and hold on for dear life and enjoy that”.How that sums up much of Westminster today – MPs and hacks who just enjoy the game and enjoy holding on as others go to the wall. But in the process they forget why anybody would want to get into this game in the first place.You might say, as Silenus does, that “you needn’t get on it at all, if you don’t want to.” And that, at times, seems like the easier and more attractive option. Yet the ride this country is on is not an amusement.If our country is to succeed in the coming years we are going to have to build as well as destroy, to develop people as well as fling them off. To find still points as well as the amusement. But nobody seems to want to think of that, so on it goes.     More from NewsThe imposition of bans should upset us more than the flouting of themAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine

them, the university watchdog chief has said.His remarks come amid a growing free speech row at Durham University which began with a student walk out during a formal dinner in protest at the columnist Rod Liddle’s appearance as a guest speaker.In his first intervention, Lord Wharton, the chairman of the Office for Students (OfS), told The  that a “robust but tolerant” exchange of views is an “essential” part of university life.Earlier this week the Durham college principal who invited Mr Liddle to speak was barred from public roles, with the university accused of “hanging him out to dry”.Prof Tim Luckhurst, principal of South College, came under fire for calling students “pathetic” after they walked out when the journalist Rod Liddle rose to speak at a formal dinner.He reportedly shouted “at South College, we value freedom of speech” as several students left the dining hall in protest at the choice of guest speaker.Prof Luckhurst is now “stepping back” from some duties while the university investigates what took place at the formal dinner.During his speech, Mr Liddle said he was disappointed not to see any sex workers that night, in reference to recent controversy over safety training provided by Durham University to student sex workers.He went on to say that the “science or pure facts” are that “a person with an X and a Y chromosome, that has a long, dangling penis, is scientifically a man, and that is pretty much, scientifically, the end of the story”.Following the event, Prof Luckhurst apologised for describing the students’ walk out as “pathetic”.But his apology was not enough to quell the anger of students, and hundreds gathered at South College this week to protest against Prof Luckhurst, wielding placards which included the slogans “Proud to be Pathetic”, “Luckhurst Out” and “Tim Out”.The university’s student union has urged him to resign, calling his position “untenable” and some undergraduates saying they will back a rent strike next term if “adequate action” has not been taken.Speaking for the first time about the events in Durham, Lord Wharton said that the university watchdog has always promoted “the widest possible definition of free speech within the law”.He went on to say: “As a point of principle it is important for students to engage with views and theories with which they may not agree.“A robust but tolerant sharing of views is an essential element of the whole experience of higher education.”He said that the OfS would not comment on inidual situations but added that it is “right for universities to invite a range of speakers to events, including those who might hold or express views in a polemical way”.Lord Wharton said students also have free speech rights including the right to protest peacefully. The row escalated on Saturday as the Free Speech Union, which is representing Prof Luckhurst, wrote to Durham University’s acting vice-chancellor to remind him of his legal duty to uphold free speech on campus.Toby Young, the general secretary of the FSU, said: “Durham says it believes in upholding academic free speech, but if so why has it placed Professor Luckhurst under investigation for describing the decision of students to walk out of the speech as ‘pathetic’?“In expressing that perfectly lawful view, Professor Luckhurst was exercising his right to free speech and penalising him for doing so could well be a breach of the law that requires universities to uphold free speech on campus.”A Durham University spokesman said that they “uphold freedom of expression within the law” adding: “We have a strong and clear policy statement and code of practice on freedom of expression and we practise this across all areas of University life”.They said it would be inappropriate to comment further while their investigation is ongoing.More from NewsThe imposition of bans should upset us more than the flouting of themAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s

much loved cafe to shut while at the same time planning to open one of its own.The Brownlow Café at the Ashridge Estate in Hertfordshire will be closing in the New Year after the trust decided not to renew the lease.The café has been run by Jensigne Molbeck-Blyth and her husband Ian Wood for nearly 13 years, with locals describing it as one of their favourite spots in the area.But the NT has said it is time to make changes to the refreshment services it offers at the country park, where it is now planning to open what it describes as an “exciting new café proposition” in the spring.That has prompted widespread anger among visitors to the Ashridge Estate, near Berkhamsted.Mrs Molbeck-Blyth, 49, and her husband accuse the NT of refusing to discuss their decision and not giving them any opportunity to appeal against it.She said: “We’re a small business employing local people and using local suppliers and we have gone through lots of ups and downs recently with Covid, thinking we wouldn’ be able to re-open after lockdown. - but now a large organisation is putting an end to us.“I believe in organisations like the National Trust. We need them to look after our manor houses and countryside. But this is awful.”Mr Wood, 52, added: “The National Trust is undermining a small business we’ve worked hard to build up over 13 years. Frankly I’m furious about it and so are lots of our customers.”Customers have vented their frustration at the NT’s decision, with more than 7,500 already signing a petition against the closure of Brownlow CafeLouise Denholm, regular visitor to the cafe, wrote on it’s Facebook page: “I can\u0027t believe you are closing on 2122 as you make the most amazing food and cakes and it is a crying shame that you are being shut down by NT after all these years.”Another visitor told her local newspaper, Hemel Today: In my view the National Trust has made a grave error in closing the café and by doing so is going to drive down the numbers of people coming to Ashridge Estate. It is also disappointing that the National Trust isn’t doing more to support a clearly successful local business.We love going to the café because it has great food and lovely staff. It is also nice to support a local business, and clearly lots of people agree as it is always busy.Mr Wood and Mrs Molbeck-Blyth were informed by the NT in July that their lease would not be renewed, with the trust activating the break clause in their contract with effect from January 31. The National Trust defended the decision not to renew the cafe’s lease, saying it was time “to revisit arrangements and make changes to our visitor offer”.A spokesperson for the trust said: “While we are unable to comment on inidual agreements, we would like to thank the Brownlow team for the contribution they have made to visitors over the years.We also want to reassure visitors that we will still offer refreshments, initially in the form of a temporary outlet, which will be open 7 days a week.We will soon be sharing an update about our exciting new café proposition, proposed to open in the spring. Visitors should not see a disruption to the service and we hope they will welcome the extended opening to suit their needs.”More from NewsThe imposition of bans should upset us more than the flouting of themAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s trial, but have the jury heard enough to convict?Beijing cracks down on Macau gambling hub amid morality driveHeir of art collector Jules Strauss forced to sell painting taken by NazisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid boosters over 30s race limit omicron stepped christmas","story":"Covid booster jabs will be offered to 30-year-olds from Monday as the Government launches a desperate dash to jab “as many people as possible” before Christmas.In a massive push to protect millions more people in the face of the new omicron variant the NHS has announced the booster will be available to everyone aged 30 to 39 three months after their second dose.More age groups are expected to be included in the coming weeks, with ministers determined to “massively expedite” the booster roll out.The  understands that several billion more pounds is to be poured into expanding the roll-out.Data shows that a third jab gives up to 75 per cent protection against infection from omicron, as well as decreasing the chances of severe illness if infected.It comes as government modellers warned the new omicron variant could cause more hospitalisations and deaths than last year’s peak, despite Plan B restrictions of mask-wearing and working from home being imposed.On Saturday the UK recorded 633 omicron cases, the biggest single daily increase since the variant was detected in the UK in November. The confirmed number of cases for the country stands now at 1,898.The Government on Saturday night made it clear it wants to dramatically speed up the programme as the best protection against omicron, with ministers considering calling in more military medics to help deliver boosters in areas where the roll-out is being held back by capacity as opposed to demand.A Government source said: We\u0027re looking at what we can do to massively expedite the booster programme. We are trying to get as many people a booster before Christmas as physically possible. It doesn\u0027t solve everything but it obviously would slow things down.Extending the top up jabs to those 30 and over, which follows updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, means another 3.5 million people will be eligible from Monday with the rest of the 7.5 million people in that age range qualifying in the coming weeks.Sajid Javid, the Health and Social Care Secretary, said: “The Covid-19 booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than 22 million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas.“This is our national mission - the most recent data shows boosters are the essential defence against omicron and we are doing everything in our power to get jabs into arms as quickly as possible.“We are now expanding the offer to over-30s – so please come forward as quickly as possible to get boosted and help our country get ahead in this race with the variant.”More from NewsThe imposition of bans should upset us more than the flouting of themAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s trial, but have the jury heard enough to convict?Beijing cracks down on Macau gambling hub amid morality driveHeir of art collector Jules Strauss forced to sell painting taken by NazisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"imposition bans should upset us flouting","story":"When I was campaigning for Brexit, I learned to keep my criticisms of the EU on a human scale.If I told people that Brussels was squandering billions of pounds in CAP fraud, they would express perfunctory disapproval. But if I told them that, as an MEP, I could have kept my wife on my payroll to the tune of £11,000 a month, they would become incandescent. Few of us can conceptualise billions but we can all imagine what we’d do with £11,000.For similar reasons, there is far more anger about staffers attending a cheese and wine event in Downing Street than there is about what now looks like a permanent curtailment of our liberties.Our brains are not designed to reckon with the gargantuan sums wiped off our GDP, to compute infection rates or to understand vaccines. But they are very good at resenting perceived unfairness.Nonetheless, I am going to try to persuade you that rows about parties are trivial. Vastly more worrying is the precedent now being set. The lockdown, instead of being a one-off, is becoming the handiest weapon in our rulers’ armoury, almost their first resort.If ministers are going to impose restrictions every time there is a new Covid variant, we will never break the cycle. And if the rest of us let it pass because we are too busy wagging our fingers about illicit gatherings, we shall be complicit in the surrender of our freedoms.I am well aware that, in the present mood, the only permitted reaction to the (alleged) party is rage. Express any other view, allow for any nuance, and you are placing yourself in the path of a lynch mob.Still, before we get too carried away, let me ask you a question. Can you tell me, hand on heart, that you stuck rigidly to every regulation and stricture through each lockdown? That you never had a surreptitious cup of tea in your garden with a neighbour, never lowered your mask when your glasses were steaming up, never cut short your hand-washing after 10 seconds, never met a friend under the cover of taking outdoor exercise?Whenever there is any alleged breach of the rules by people in politics, the rest of the country furiously complains that It’s One Rule For Them And One For Us. But this isn’t true or, if it is, it is true in precisely the opposite way from that intended.I’m pretty sure that most people, at one time or another, have interpreted the rules flexibly. But, unless they are in the public eye, they don’t expect to be condemned. Think, for example, of the massive BLM protests over the summer. They were, by any definition, illegal. Are columnists demanding that all the demonstrators be prosecuted? Of course not.Most people treat the lockdown rules rather like the Highway Code. They occasionally break the letter of the law in what they see as safe and proportionate ways. But this does not prevent them from condemning infractions in others – especially types of infraction that they happen not to commit themselves.In every locked down country, politicians proved themselves human. Some attended gatherings, some had haircuts, some travelled after testing positive. In Ireland, several public figures had to resign after a dinner in a golf club.In every case, the One Rule For Them line was trotted out regardless of how harshly the politicians were punished.Here, Labour MPs have been found to breach the rules by, among other things, attending big funerals, having an affair and (in the case of Jeremy Corbyn) having dinner with too many guests.My point is not that they are hypocrites it is that the rules are wrong. Laws that no one follows are, by definition, asinine laws. By all means blame politicians. But blame them for imposing these absurd prohibitions in the first place rather than for behaving like everyone else.Which brings us to the latest set of restrictions, the so-called Plan B. I believe they are a mistake, but not for the facile reason given by cynics. The idea that they are a distraction from bad headlines about the Downing Street gathering does not stack up. If the PM wanted to move the conversation on from breaches of the rules last Christmas, he wouldn’t have started a conversation about rules this Christmas. In any case, the notion that Chris Whitty, Patrick Vallance and the rest are playing along with a dead cat ersionary tactic is too silly for words.No, ministers are responding to the advice they are getting from officials. They have been told that, unchecked, the Omicron variant will cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths. They have also been told that, while two vaccine doses provide a low level of immunity, a third dose massively increases our resilience. Their strategy is therefore to slow things up while dispensing as many boosters as possible.The trouble is that, yet again, they are reversing the burden of proof. If they want to apply the full coercive force of the law, it should be up to them to demonstrate that their bans are proportionate.In the case of Omicron, we don’t yet have any reason to think that restrictions are needed. We know that the mutation makes the virus easier to catch – some studies say three times more transmissible than Delta. But there is no evidence that it is lethal.Indeed, early data give grounds for optimism. The World Health Organisation has so far not documented a single recorded death from the variant. The South African doctor who discovered it says its effects are mild, a view shared by both the European Medicines Agency and the US Centre for Disease Control.If these early findings are confirmed, we may be witnessing the end of the epidemic, the moment reached by almost all viruses, when their transmissibility increases and their virulence subsides. Covid, like the Spanish flu before it, will become one of the many seasonal respiratory diseases that we call “a cold”. Omicron will be its Omega.Yes, of course this is a big “if”. Things may change. But, to repeat, the burden of proof should always rest with those wishing to curtail our elemental liberties. It is not up to opponents of further prohibitions to show that they are not needed. Freedom should be our default.That is why we should be so concerned about these pre-emptive measures. They suggest that, from now on, we will respond to any putative threat by sending people home. And that road, once taken, will not be easily abandoned.There will surely be more Covid mutations. And there will surely be more diseases as yet un-encountered by our doctors. Are we seriously going to start banning things every time, just in case?True, the measures so far announced are relatively light. To be honest, I thought that face-masks were already required in theatres – certainly they have been worn in all the theatres I have attended since they reopened.But as long as there are any restrictions at all, they allow a chunk of our public sector to sit on its hands. Civil servants refuse to come to the office, local councils fail to process forms, schools cancel events – and, of course, there is a commensurate knock to our national output.My worry is that these restrictions are being imposed, not because of bad headlines, but because ministers know that, even if the rate of hospitalisation is very low, a small percentage of a big number is still a big number. They don’t want to be accused of having acted too late, and would rather slow our recovery and diminish our civil rights than run the slightest risk of appearing complacent.Again, why should that logic be any different in the event of a future threat, however notional, to public health? Before 2020, government advisers believed that people would not put up with a lockdown for more than a few weeks.In the event, it turned out that we have an almost unlimited tolerance for authoritarianism. Yes, there are some outraged libertarian dissidents. But, though their outrage has increased, their numbers have not.No, we are doing this to ourselves. Having fought the two world wars and the Cold War in the name of inidual freedom, we seem to have lost all interest in the concept. We are upset, not at the imposition of bans, but at others flouting them. What a servile lot we have become.     More from NewsAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s trial, but have the jury heard enough to convict?Beijing cracks down on Macau gambling hub amid morality driveHeir of art collector Jules Strauss forced to sell painting taken by NazisRichard Osman: Over-70s have ‘disappeared’ from British arts and cultureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"return shirking home","story":"Here we go again. As from tomorrow, millions of people will once again be working from home. ‘Go to work if you must,’ said Boris Johnson on Wednesday, ‘but work from home if you can.’ For swathes of workers, the news they can once again switch the frosty commute for the warm bath of remote working will feel like Christmas came early, but not everyone is so impressed: ‘Small biz will collapse’, Lord Sugar succinctly tweeted. WFH is supposed to be the new normal, a flexible utopia of happy shiny employees working harder, better and smarter at kitchen tables across the land. But it simply isn’t working out that way in many sectors – sectors which are critical for the smooth and efficient running of the country.The most obvious and shocking example of this is the testimony of former Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) employee Raphael Marshall about the department’s handling of mass evacuations from Afghanistan in August. More than once, Marshall said, he found himself alone in the office, and ‘staffing shortages were exacerbated by some staff working from home, which hampered communication.’This was one of the biggest foreign policy crises in living memory: a time when thousands of desperate Afghans were pleading for their lives and British soldiers on the ground were doing an extraordinary job under the most difficult conditions imaginable. In other words, this was a time when any conscientious and well-managed department would have been working round the clock. Working from home? Shirking from home, more like.The catastrophic mismanagement of the petrol crisis a few weeks after the Afghanistan debacle was also partly due to the fact that so many officials in the Department of Transport were remote working. At times like that, and also during the fiasco over granting visas for 5,000 foreign HGV drivers, Zoom meetings simply don’t cut it. You need people in the room so they can brainstorm how to solve problems. Otherwise information gets misplaced and responsibility dodged.A similar pattern, albeit under less extreme circumstances, can be seen across many government departments, with public service inefficiency bringing a deluge of complaints. More than 500,000 driving licences were delayed over the summer after industrial action by the Public and Commercial Services Union, some of whose staff were reluctant to return to the office even when told that they could. People applying for passports are advised to ‘allow up to 10 weeks’, more than three times the clearing period pre-coronavirus. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks, designed to weed out certain public sector applicants with criminal records, have at times taken twice as long as usual to process.Latest HMRC figures show that they are clearing only just over a third of postal cases and inquiries within their 15-day target. And in some parts of the country, planning searches are taking up to 14 weeks. These searches are neither especially complex nor specialised, and in normal times efficient councils can turn them round in a week or two. Delays affect not just homebuyers and mortgage lenders but commercial projects too.It would be bad enough if it was just the public sector affected. But everyone has their own stories of private sector incompetence too: not just in the early days of the pandemic last year, when every organisation was feeling its way and trying to adjust to an unprecedented situation, but still to this day. Dante Alighieri gave his Inferno nine circles of hell, but were he alive today he would surely add a tenth featuring automated answering services and their repeated insistence that his call was important to them.Research both here and abroad has found that working from home has negative effects on productivity. A Cambridge University study published last month showed that during restriction periods people spend less time on work-related activities than usual, with parents of young children unsurprisingly accounting for the biggest difference. A University of Chicago study found that productivity of those working from home fell by up to a fifth, especially among women (who take the brunt of household and childcare tasks.) And Japan’s Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) says that the average productivity of employees when working from home compared to in their workplaces is 68 per cent - a drop of almost a third.Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology at the University of Manchester, says that ‘even before the lockdowns, we had the technology to move to remote working and there were very good reasons why we didn’t.’ Offices exist for a reason. They’re designed to encourage and facilitate work, and in doing so minimise the kind of distractions common at home: housework, shopping, social media, cooking, children, housemates, delivery drivers, pets.A positive company culture is much harder to maintain by remote. Video meetings are a pale facsimile of real-life ones: concentrating on a screen makes them tiring, the inability to sense others’ body language and non-verbal communication makes them limited, and the awkwardness of dialogue patterns when only one person at a time can have the electronic conch of the framed window makes them unwieldy for any more than three or four people. The chance encounters and spontaneous conversations that lead to great ideas and foster better relationships are reduced to zero. WFH involves more time and expense spent on communication and co-ordination, cutting into uninterrupted work hours.It’s for reasons such as these that Netflix boss Reed Hastings says: ‘not being able to get together in person is a pure negative.’ It’s even worse for people who’ve joined organisations in the last 18 months, and will have met few or maybe even none of their colleagues in person. How are they supposed to do their jobs efficiently? How can they have been trained properly without the ability to go and ask questions of a colleague a couple of desks away?Researchers at the Rotterdam School of Management in Netherlands found that world-class chess players have in general been making worse moves when playing online from home than when physically facing opponents over the board: and work tasks often require the same skills as chess moves, such as strategy, analysis, pattern recognition, option evaluation and decision-making under time pressure.The concept of the work-life balance, which WFH was thought to aid, has always been predicated on the separation between work and life: you go somewhere separate to work, and when you leave that place so too is your work done until the next day. The erosion of the work-life balance is usually couched in terms of work taking over life - and indeed in the wake of the pandemic there have been calls from unions for the government to follow the French example and allow workers to ‘fully disconnect’ and have no legal obligation to answer office communications outside working hours.But of course the work-life balance can work the other way too, with life taking over work to the detriment of the latter. In his testimony, Marshall referred to ‘a deliberate drive by the FCDO to prioritise ‘work-life balance’. FCDO employees, including senior leaders, are often told that working more than eight hours a day suggests that they are inefficient…. Whilst a healthy ‘work-life balance’ is important in moderation, in my opinion the FCDO’s approach has undermined organisational effectiveness,’ he said.No-one’s claiming that WFH is the only reason for poor performance, of course. Covid has seen millions of workers signed off sick at one stage of the pandemic or another, and for businesses relying on physical supply chains there have also been problems arising from Brexit border issues and the closure of the Suez Canal. But one of the first rules of any efficient organisation is ‘control the controllables’, and there are few things more controllable than the whereabouts of your employees.‘Working from home’ used to be a term of sarcasm, with air quotes around the phrase and a knowing smile. The suspicion is that in some cases it remains at least partly so. At the start of the pandemic, the Queen told the nation that ‘while we may have more still to endure, better days will return… We will meet again.’ Those days will return, but only if those meetings are in offices rather than just in pubs.More from NewsThe imposition of bans should upset us more than the flouting of themAnalysis: Prosecution rests in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s trial, but have the jury heard enough to convict?Beijing cracks down on Macau gambling hub amid morality driveHeir of art collector Jules Strauss forced to sell painting taken by NazisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Sunday.

Political staff and officials would frequently drink after work until the early hours of the morning, and order takeaway food to Ms Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions- while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. While most DWP staff worked from home throughout the pandemic, a “core team” of her private office staff - who have desks in a small area outside her office door - continued to work from the departmental HQ, close to Westminster Abbey. At one such occasion during last year’s festive season, Ms Coffey handed out Christmas presents to her team. It comes as Whitehall was in ‘outright panic’ that more details of lockdown-breaking parties would surface in the coming days. The Mirror has been told aposgatheringsapos in Ms Coffeyaposs office throughout the pandemic were an open secret, with one source saying even during lockdown, there were parties all the time. Bottles of wine and beer were routinely found between staff members’ salads and sandwiches in fridges at the department, to be drunk at the informal, late-night soirees. A DWP insider said: “There is a constant flow of booze in the office.”  While the parties were not ‘organised’, staff meetings would often “evolve” into drinking, which would carry on until the early hours of the morning. Before the pandemic, Ms Coffey was reportedly the host of notorious late night karaoke sessions in the Houses of Parliament, which would regularly take place in her Commons office. The DWP told the Sunday Mirror there was “no karaoke” at the gatherings during the pandemic, but did not deny that late night drinking and mingling took place. A DWP spokesperson said: Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the COVID- rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place. On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gts to her core team, as she does every year. Ms Coffey faced fury earlier this year after the Mirror published a video of her singing aposIaposve Had the Time of My Leapos at a karaoke party at Tory party conference, the day before slashing Universal Credit for thousands of struggling families.Last week, the Mirror revealed a Christmas Party with drinks and canapés had been held at the Department for Education while Tier  rules were in place.And today, it emerged that staff at the Treasury held a boozy celebration to mark Rishi Sunak ’s spending review in November .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TreasuryDepartment for Work and PensionsBoris JohnsonAlcoholPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Why  No one knows. Or, at least, no one is willing to say. For as far back as anyone can remember, a stream of out-of-touch, often privately educated, Education Secretaries, have signed off on the idea that teaching student’s th century literature, at Level , is just what students need to secure them a decent job in the workplace. Students who don’t pass their GCSEs are forced to repeat what they’ve already failed at. Forced to engage with books written in a language they will never use. Trying to explain to young students who already feel like they have failed, why Jane Eyre is so important to them, is borderline abuse. At a time when young people are turning away from books and literature at an alarming rate, no one in government seems bothered or interested in providing students with something a little more relatable. Last week I had to face one such group. The futility and unfairness of it struck me mid lesson. I had no argument as to why they should engage with Dracula.  Why reading Stoker would be of use, interest, or benefit to them unless they had an express desire to go into further education. Which the vast majority don’t. Starting off a lesson with the words, ‘Today we are going to be looking at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ will mean within two minutes % of a GCSE class will have shut down. Do the powers that be think there is no other literature available to young people  Using contemporary texts by authors like Kit de Waal or Lisa McInerny, would at least give students and teachers a fighting chance. If educators were permitted to teach English using contemporary literature that told of the lives and challenges of iniduals who looked and sounded like the students they were teaching, on subjects like county lines, gangs and drugs, or any other aspect of st century teenage le, more students would engage. It’s what they are familiar with. What takes up much of their time. And using a language they use themselves exploring issues and situations they can identy with. A large section of the materials we currently use to teach our young students are entirely ineffective. In fact, they are worse than ineffective. Relying on these texts throws unnecessary, unhelpful barriers in the paths of students. It damages their already damaged faith in themselves and a system that is supposed to support, nurture, and encourage them. If you don’t believe me, ask them yourselves. @StephenTuffin is a lecturer in Swindon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsChristmas partyGCSEsRochester and Strood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Senior MPs, including a Tory former health minister, gave the Prime Minister  days to answer questions about the guest list for the party on December , and details of a party alleged to have taken place in his flat on November . The cross-party group of MPs and peers - including Tory Dr Dan Poulter - today called on Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s probe into the parties answer key questions within  days. Mr Case was last week tasked with investigating “the facts” of the party on December  in Number , details of which were first revealed by the Daily Mirror. The probe has since been extended to cover the party at the Department for Education, as well as a further gathering alleged to have taken place in the PM’s Downing Street flat on November . But Number  has resisted putting a timescale on his probe, with the PM only saying it would report back as quickly as possible. Today, in a letter coordinated by the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Coronavirus, a cross-party group of MPs and Peers called on the PM to admit to “any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  ”And they demanded to know the guest list for the December  Christmas party, who organised and sanctioned it, and what knowledge of it the Prime Minister had at the time. It follows new polling, which suggests that % of people no longer trust the UK government to handle the nation’s pandemic response with % saying the scandal would negatively impact compliance with Covid rules. The polling, from from Best for Britain, the APPG’s Secretariat found % of  Tory voters thought it made people less likely to follow Covid restrictions - while % of Leave voters had also lost confidence in the government. Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus said: “We’ve heard first hand of the pain and loss people have endured during this pandemic. “To know that at the same time, those in Number  were partying and laughing about their rule-breaking, is absolutely sickening. “This investigation must be thorough. If the Prime Minister was aware of this party it is a resignation matter.” Naomi Smith, Chief Executive of Best for Britain said: “Our polling shows the real world dangers of a government that plays fast and loose with the trust of the British people. “This investigation cannot be a whitewash, with fewer people now expected to observe Covid guidelines, answering these questions is a matter of le and death.”  The letter in full Prime Minister,As the UK faces the new Omicron iant this winter, it has never been more important for the public to trust the UK Government’s response to the pandemic and observe all restrictions in place to save lives and protect the NHS. Therefore, the growing evidence supporting allegations of a social gathering at  Downing Street in contravention of Covid restrictions is deeply concerning.Your belated announcement of an internal investigation into this breach of Covid rules is welcome, but we remain concerned at the scope and the timeline of this investigation. For this reason we the undersigned ask you, to guarantee in writing that within the next  days, the investigation will provide answers to the following questions which are in the urgent public interest:Who attended the Downing Street party on th December  Who sanctioned and organised the event  Was the Prime Minister aware  And when did he become aware  Will the Prime Minister guarantee that all evidence is shared with the politan Police as soon as it becomes available  Were there any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  A Christmas party in Downing Street at a time when the public made enormous sacrices, including spending Christmas in isolation and far from sick and even dying relatives, would not only represent a flagrant breach of the rules, but a breach of the trust of the British people as well. At this crucial time in the pandemic, the public must have full trust in the UK Government’s ability to safeguard lives. It is vital that this investigation urgently restores public trust in the UK Government’s pandemic response and all public health measures in place.

And Tehran signalled two weeks ago it might accept the payment in Covid jabs and medicines which would count as humanitarian aid. In an exclusive interview Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe said: “All countries need vaccines. If the offer was worth more than £million Iran could be interested. “Andwe settled this debt Nazainin could be released the next day. It would be an amazing Christmas present for her to be home.” But as things stand Richard and daughter, Gabriella, , will spend their sixth Christmas without Nazanin despite his  day hunger strike outside the Foreign Office last month. Richard added: “Nazanin has been very blue these past few days, as the realisation has hit her that we are drting again. “But Gabriella has had a happy time decorating the tree and helping me put up lights. After the intensity of the hunger strike, it is also nice to have some good times.”  Nazanin, , has been detained in Iran since April,  and was sentenced to five years over spying charges. She now faces another one year jail term. Britain claims she is being held hostage with other dual nationals as the two countries wrangle over money. Ministers admit the cash is owed for battle tanks never delivered but keep coming up with dferent excuses not to pay it. In March Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK’s refusal to cough up was “a stain on Britain’s honour”. Now he says the money can only be paid“a practicable and legally-viable means” can be found. Foreign Office minister Lord Zac Goldsmith said last month to pay would be ransom money. He added: “Payment of any money becomes payment for a hostage. That is not in our current, medium or long-term interests.” Richard said: “His comments were legally illiterate and irresponsible for the message it sent to Iran. “Ministers cannot throw out words like “hostage” and “ransom” when they just want to deflect Parliamentary scrutiny. “My fear is that the debt is also leverage for the UK side - using it to push Iran into the nuclear deal or something  - and Nazanin has become a bargaining chip for both sides.” Middle East minister James Cleverly refuses to talk about negotiations saying he “will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on th November and another with his deputy Bagheri Kani three days later without any resolution.  In  Iran ordered , Chieftain battle tanks and  repair vehicles costing £million from Britain. Only  tanks were delivered before the  Iranian revolution overthrew the Shah and pitched the country into the hands of Islamic clerics and Britain banned arms sales. When new Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini asked for a £million refund to make up for the missing weaponry Britain refused to hand it over. Yet in  the international court in The Hague ordered Britain to repay the money which is still sitting in an independent trust in the UK. Iran now wants £million in interest which Britain will not pay either. Britain has argued the money cannot be repaid because Iran is under UN sanctions - yet that did not stop America coughing up a similar sum to release four American prisoners in . And former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “We are a country that pays its debts.”Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s family have said she was repeatedly told that her arrest was linked with the debt that the UK owes. Richard has now been on two hunger strikes - the first two years ago outside London’s Iranian Embassy - but he is not about to embark on a third. He said: “They put a real strain on the family, as well as on my body. So none planned for a while, and hopefully none needed.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSMiddle EastUnited NationsForeign OfficeJames CleverlyAyatollah Ruhollah KhomeiniZac GoldsmithJeremy HuntNazanin Zaghari-RatclfeLiz TrussPrisonsIranChristmas partyDebtHandsTribunals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is aimed at reducing contacts.The furlough scheme has not ed, however, as no businesses are being shut down at this stage. The advice is to work from home aposwhere you canapos.Face masksNew rules brought into force on Friday mean that anyone aged  or over must wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues. These include places such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys. The full list: community centres , youth centres, members clubs and social clubs libraries and public reading rooms shops public transport polling stations and premises used for the counting of votes places of worship crematoria and burial ground chapels visitor attractions and entertainment venuespublic areas in hotels and hostels indoor areas of sports stadiumsPubs, bars and nightclubs are exempt. There is also an exemption for singing, which applies to, for example, congregations and choirs. Technically, a person could avoid wearing a face mask by singing, but the Government has warned protestors attempting to abuse this rule will be stoped.Care homes  From Wednesday, there will be a new restriction on care home visits.Care home residents will be asked to pick three people to visit and one essential care worker.Covid passports From Wednesday, England could be facing the introduction of mandatory covid passes proving your vaccination status to enter some venues, including nightclubs.So a punter could have proof of double jabbed status or, under the new pass rules, a text message or email from the NHS showing a lateral flow result to get into a venue.Firms failing to check Covid passes properly may be fined £, and up to £, for repeat offences.But Boris Johnson is facing a major backlash to the plan as Tory backbenchers look set to vote against the plan. The PM may get the changes though parliament with Labour support but given he is under major pressure over the Christmas parties plan, the rules could be watered down.What about Christmas So far, there are no limits on travel, household mixing and meeting groups of people.Downing Street has also rejected calls to put new restrictions on hospitality venues, so your Christmas party can still go ahead.What about a aposPlan Capos  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already. But Omicron could change things, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under pressure to bring in more stringent measures before Christmas.Further measures could include hospitality check-ins, tougher isolation rules, face masks in all indoor venues and further vaccine passport rules.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Plan BBoris JohnsonNHSAppsThe economyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The UK recorded its highest number of Covid infections since January  today and UK scientists warned millions could catch the new strain before the New Year as it will become the dominant iant in the UK by mid-December. The Survation poll for the Mirror reveals % of people are less likely to follow Covid rulesGovernment officials have broken them. The survey of , Brits online found % believe Government officials did break the rules at the peak of the second wave, with % stating the incidents should be investigated by the police. And % of Conservative voters who backed Boris Johnson in the last General Election believe the Tories think itaposs one rule for them and another for everyone .The poll comes after Professor Chris Whitty said he fears Brits will not accept new lockdown restrictions after enduring almost two years of the pandemic. Speaking to a  at the Local Government Association he added: “My greatest worry at the moment is that people…we need to do something more muscular at some point, whether it’s for the current new iant or at some later stage, can we still take people with us ”  The Office for National Statisticsinfection survey found  in  people had Covid in England, in the week ending December . This equates to around , people. On Friday face masks were made mandatory in most indoor spaces including cinemas, theatres, churches and galleries.And from Monday those who can work from home are advised to do so, and on Wednesday the NHS Covid Passwill become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and other large gatherings.The PM’s spokesman slapped down rumours of a Covid ‘Plan C’ or a ‘Plan B plus’ being prepared for the New Year just in case the plan B measures did not curb the new iant. Plan B measures are set to be introduced next week, with MPs set to vote on the measures in the Commons on Tuesday. But at least  Tory MPs are set to rebel and vote against the introduction of tighter Covid restrictions, with many furious with Mr Johnson’s handling of Downing Street party revelations.  Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper said the PMaposs authority has been diminished by the Owen Paterson sleaze row and the alleged Downing Street party. He told the Commons on Wednesday: “Why should people listen to the Prime Minister’s instructions to follow the rules when people inside Number  Downing Street don’t do so ”And renowned rebel Steve Baker told the Mirror he hoped Labour would vote against the measures.But shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting slammed rumours of Labour voting against plan B restrictions in order to defeat the PM.He told BBC ’s Radio  Today programme “public health has always come first for the Labour Party during the pandemic. Despite the trouble the Government finds themselves in, public health will still come before party politics”. Sir Keir Starmer said the booster programme should have been ramped up weeks ago. “The Government pooh-poohed that it’s now doing it but again, as ever, too late, he added.The Survation study put Labour on a six-point lead over the Conservatives, which suggests voters have lost faith in Mr Johnsonaposs handling of the pandemic following the party scandal. Since the Mirror first revealed parties were held at the Prime Ministeraposs Number  flat in the run up to Christmas last year, the PM is now facing accusations of seven separate parties and drinks doaposs held across Westminster in November and December last year. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case is currently investigating three dates on which bashes were said to have been held in breach of lockdown rules. They are, a No leaving do on November  at which the PM spoke a No Christmas party on December  and a Department for Education bash on December . Downing Street has cancelled its Christmas party this year blaming the increase in workload for the cancelled plans. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: I think weaposve made it clear since the latest situation with Omicron, obviously thataposs taking up a great deal of time at the moment. He added: Thereaposs no plans for [a party] in Number .On November , sources told the Mirror people gathered for drinks in Boris and Carrie Johnsonaposs flat above  Downing Street. And on the same day, farewell drinks were held in number s round table room - the night Dominic Cummings quit. Two weeks later on November , sources claim  to  people crammed into a room at Number  to say goodbye to top aide Cleo Watson, an ally of Cummings. Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has admitted to holding a canapes reception for his top team on December . Four days later people working on the London mayoral campaign for candidate Shaun Bailey held their own ‘raucous’ party. And on December  the Mirror broke the story about the Number  Christmas Party. ITV News reported on Thursday that Jack Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications at No , addressed up to  people at a Christmas gathering said to have been held on December .He offered to resign but the PM turned it down. A Number  spokesperson said Ed Oldfield is still in his position and the PM is still confident with his position, despite accepting Allegra Stratton’s resignation.

Let’s assume the officer found groups of ying sizes, including one room with - people, participating in a Christmas quiz, with alcohol, which led to drinks later and mingling between offices. On  December , London was in Tier . Under paragraph  of Schedule  to the “All Tiers” regulations, no person could participate in a gathering indoors of two or more people. The officer would have considered possible exceptions. The first relevant one is a “permitted organised gathering”, under paragraph . But that could only workpeople participated alone or in household groups. That doesn’t seem to apply here. The second is that the gathering was “reasonably necessary for work” under paragraph . Maybe the civil servants would say that they needed the quiz for morale, or had to stay at work to run the government.  The officer might think: well, what is “reasonably necessary” for an office is a bit subjective. But the government told us exactly what they thought was “reasonably necessary for work” – their own guidance at the time said “you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity”. So that seems to exclude the work exception. The final question is whether No.  was somehow exempt from the Covid regulations. Lawyers have been debating this. I’m not convinced. I think the “crown property” exemption was about government buildings, not people. And I doubt that people could say they were doing their duties as crown servants and therefore exemptthey were doing things which the government had advised everyone not to do – and which broke the law. As for the Prime Minister – he appears to have been taking part in a social gathering indoors of more than one person, so may well have breached the regulations too.

He predicted that the figure could be reached “sometime in January”the iant is resistant to existing protection and it has a similar severity to Delta - which is not yet known.  “Even the best-case scenarios involve several-fold more admissions per day than we’re getting at the moment – we are at about  right now,” he added. It comes as scientists say that Omicron could become the dominant iant by as soon as next week. And the government is currently looking at putting in stricter restrictions, it is reported. Daily Covid- cases have now reached their highest level in almost a year and the UKHSA predicted that,current trends continue, the UK will exceed one million infections by the end of the month. The UKHSA has also found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared to Delta.Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned of a “deeply concerning situation” after holding a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and the co-ordinated response across the four nations.The government said there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK and the last time a higher daily figure was reported was on January , when , cases were recorded. An additional  confirmed cases of the Omicron iant have been reported across the UK, bringing the total number to ,. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said early data indicates that “a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron iant compared to Delta strain”. She added: “The data suggest this risk is signicantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible.” Gove said the Omicron iant is doubling every two to three days in England “and possibly even faster in Scotland”. He added that % of reported cases in London are the new iant, and warned that evidence suggests Omicron is “more likely” than past Covid iants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated.  Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned of the possibility of a “tsunami of infections” from the new iant – and said she could not rule out more restrictions north of the border as a result.But so far Boris Johnson has “no plans” to go further with measures in England, amid claims that he is considering a Plan C with tougher restrictions.Now under Plan B, people are required to wear masks in more indoor spaces including museums, galleries and community centres. There will be ato working from home guidance from Monday, and mandatory Covid passports for large venues from Wednesday.The new regulations will be put to a debate and vote in the Commons next week – and with Labour ’s support they are certain to be approved despite the prospect of a large Conservative revolt.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSOmicron iantCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some staff who worked on the  autumn spending review had office drinks while England was under lockdown restrictions.It comes as Boris Johnson battles mounting revelations of rule-breaking festivities in Downing Street in the run-up to last Christmas.The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on November , . A Treasury spokesman said: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the Spending Review . We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.  “They’d all been working really hard,” a source told the Times. “They had to be in the office anyway that day. It wasn’t a formal party but perhaps in hindsight it wasn’t the most sensible thing to do.” At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including workit could not be done from home.The Times said Chancellor Rishi Sunak was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year.

Collectively, from the public to the Govern­ment, we need to do every­thing we can to prevent any future such acts of cruelty and injustice. Social workers are passionate about change, and it’s a really tough job – it is unfair to single out iniduals for the death of a child when we need to be looking at society as a whole.  I also really welcome the Attorney General’s announcement of a sentence review in the case of little Arthur’s killers. It highlights a wider issue of the need for tougher sentences on serious crimes. As I have personally experienced this with sentences for the perpetrators of acid attacks, I feel strongly that there should be a minimum term for serious crimes such as these – with no exceptions. And we can only hope harsher sentences act as a deterrent to those who would otherwise commit such acts.  Serious crimes are trivialisedsentencing is not tough – it’s vital the justice system places a true value on human le and dignity. Seeing football stadiums erupt into applause for Arthur in a display of public unity last weekend really touched my heart. As the public, we have the luxury of hindsight. But by addressing these issues head-on now, we can prevent another tragic case such as little Arthur’s from happening again.

Susan Forde, will marry partner, Rob, in just over a weekaposs time and had been looking forward to the big day after it being repeatedly pushed back because of the pandemic. But she and her partner have been left distraught after scaffolding was erected around the Church of St Mary Magdelene in Melton, Leicestershire, ruining the couple’s picturesque location.“I never thought I would get married, but I met Rob and that all changed,” Susan told Leicestershire Live.“I’m a believer in God and want to get married in a church. I have been to Stapleford Hall a lot over the last  years and just fell in love with it. This was the only place I could imagine getting married at.  “When you’ve invested so much time and emotion into this over so many years, it’s upsetting that my dream has been ruined.” The appearance of the scaffolding and associated works came at short notice and has left the couple from Oadby angry at those in charge of the church and Stapleford Hall. After investing thousands in their wedding and delaying it multiple times, they say they’ve been badly let down. Rob said: “We had paid so much over the years, money which has gone into the upkeep of the place and this is what we get in   “It’s disgraceful.”  “I’m angry they’ve behaved like this,” said Susan. “Why couldn’t they hold back until after our wedding  It would have been just a matter of days, that’s all.” The Churches Conservation Trust, which owns the Church of St Mary Magdalene, said the scaffolding was needed out of urgency.A spokesman said: “As a charity, we have been fortunate to receive a grant from the Government’s Heritage Stimulus Fund to carry out urgent repair work to the tower pinnacles and parapets of the west tower, which has become heavily fractured due to weather erosion and unstable,“This funding opportunity is time-limited, and we are obliged to carry out the repair works as soon as possible. “We are very sorry for the distress caused by the appearance of scaffolding at the church. We realise the huge impact this must have had on the iniduals involved and for this, we are very sorry.” Stapleford Hall was keen to point out how urgent the works were. A spokesman added: “As the work was deemed as essential emergency repairs, Stapleford Park is pleased that this amazing church is being safeguarded for the future. “We sympathise greatly for the couple and can confirm that no element of the wedding ceremony or reception has been affected due to the nature of the works to the exterior of the church.” With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

It’s a major part of our day,” said Susan. “There’s a picture of the church on our order of service. We’ve got people coming from Ireland and Leeds for the day and all of them want to see the church.” “This isn’t going to be the same. It’s so disappointing.” “We’ve been treated shoddily and are not happy,” said Rob. “We believe more could have been done to avoid this happening.” The Churches Trust said they did everything they could. A spokesman said “We were in touch with the Stapleford Estate as soon as we were aware of the works needing to take place at the church to enable them to liaise with the couples and we offered options of rescheduling or refunds. “In the meantime, our contractors are doing what they can to make the church as presentable as possible despite the scaffolding.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Elizabeth Astin, , and her husband, sourced materials, furniture and bargain decorations from the likes of Amazon, BM and The Range instead of paying professionals to do the legwork. The couple, from Birmingham, sourced wooden sleepers for their builder saving them £,.Their nephew fitted the electrics and they built a relaxing zen area using leftover supplies, , BirminghamLive reports. Elizabeth sourced bargain decorations and furniture from Amazon, BM and The Range.  She told money-saving community LatestDeals: We moved into our house as a new building  years ago. When we bought it, the agent told us that there was no back garden. What they meant was that there was a lower patio area with a huge retaining wall and a sloping upper area that was north facing. Not very attractive at all. Still, it stood us in good stead over the years. Our girls had water fights, we bought numerous bouncy castles, water slides and paddling pools and my husband and his dad made a decking for the adults to chill. We always wanted to improve it but it was for the kids. While they were young, it was more important for them to have a safe place to play. Now they are grown up, we wanted to finally tackle the garden and improve it. The first step was planning. It was dficult with the garden being on a slope. We realised we needed at least two levels or terraced areas to be able to have somewhere to entertain and relax. The back garden gets sun at the top of the garden all day long, she said, so the couple worked around it to make sure they maximised the sunshine.She added: Before starting on the makeover, I had spent a lot of time browsing the Facebook group ‘DIY on a budget gardens’.I learned a great deal and got lots of inspiration from group members. We were always mindful to try and keep costs down without compromising on quality and our dreams.  We saved up for all of this including replacing the iron railings with a lovely glass fence. It was a big project. The existing decking was built by my husband and father in law when we moved in two decades ago. This had to be pulled down and the areas levelled. We had a beautul clematis that sadly had to be pulled down too and that was done by my husband - it took him two days to do it. It was a complete makeover. We also had to pull down and replace an ugly iron fence on top of the large retaining wall. The couple paid a builder to do the landscaping, build the patios and replace concrete slabs with Indian stone, which took up the main budget. Elizabeth said: We had to get someone in to build the glass and steel fence as well as do parts of the project ourselves due to the nature of the makeover and the retaining wall. We had to ensure the wall could hold the new patio areas so we needed professional help. The building work was £k but we saved money by having the electrics fitted by our nephew who is an electrician. Also, we managed to reduce the price by using wooden railway sleepers rather than building retaining walls. The builder provided all the materials. We had an original quote for £k from another builder so by having the sleepers we saved approximately £k. The glass fence was £, and once that was installed, my husband used the leftover Indian stone and sleepers from the builder to create a little zen area. He built a bench and a space to put a relaxing water feature on. We also reused the old gray slabs from the original patio and laid them in the front garden, to build a little seating area. Part of this area included tub chairs we already had from Aldi, which we had bought the year before for £. I bought furnishings such as cushions and decorations from Amazon and BM. I probably spent around £ on these, again trying to source the best value for money.  The day bed was from The Range. I searched for the best price and got it for around £. The same bed on other websites were between £ and £ so I basically got it half price. I also wanted to arrange the plants to suit the new makeover. Most of them were already there before - I just replanted them. We did, however, buy a few more from a local garden center. They were very cheap - probably no more than £ for all of them. Now the project is finally done, it’s our safe haven. We managed to save thousands by combining professional work with DIY and my husband created an amazing little zen area that was previously barren. The garden is a sanctuary for us to relax in now. The only thing which didn’t go to plan was the installation of the furniture, as it took a while for it to arrive. If we had to do this project again we would order it well in advance as we only received the dining set this week. It’s now in the garage waiting for next year!’ Tom Church, Co-Founder of LatestDeals said: Elizabeth and her husband have managed to create a stunning garden that no doubt increases the value of their property, after waiting nearly two decades to complete the makeover. With dficult areas, sometimes getting a professional in is best - but as Elizabeth has proven, sourcing budget supplies and doing parts of the overall makeover yourself can save you thousands of pounds. I hope this garden lasts them many years to come.

People can make their booking two months on from their second dose - a month in advance of becoming eligible to receive the jab.  There are around . million people aged  to , and . million of those are eligible from Monday. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid- vaccination programme, said: Following the updated guidance from the JCVI, which shortened the interval between second and booster doses, NHS staff are redoubling their efforts to protect the public from the virus. The NHS vaccination programme, the biggest and most successful in health service history, will from tomorrow offer top-up jabs to everyone aged  and over three months from their second jab. With the emergence of the new iant and the rising case numbers, there has never been a more important time to get boosted. So, when itaposs your turn, come forward and book in.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: The Covid- booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than  million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas.This is our national mission - the most recent data shows boosters are the essential defence against Omicron and we are doing everything in our power to get jabs into arms as quickly as possible. We are now expanding the offer to over-s - so please come forward as quickly as possible to get boosted and help our country get ahead in this race with the iant. Experts from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine , who also sit on the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingor the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , used experimental data to look at how Omicron may transmit as the country heads into , and predicted a large wave of infections in January. On Friday, analysis by the UK Health Security Agencyfound that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provided much lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared with Delta. But the UKHSA said a booster dose gives around % to % protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron, as it urged people to have their boosters.

Taking it on as a lockdown project, the couple also scrolled through Pinterest to get their inspiration. During lockdown when we were house searching we had a lot more time on our hands, they told bargain site LatestDeals. So I spent hours on Instagram and Pinterest saving pictures of my favourite ideas and creating a mood board for each room.The kitchen had plain brown cupboards and black worktops, so we decided to create more of a monochrome feel with marble effect countertops and matching accessories. We did the whole project on a budget by sourcing items from BQ, IKEA and Facebook Marketplace. They found some of the items they needed at Homebase, including a roller set for £. and two tins of Maison Deco Refresh paint to cover the worktops, cupboards and splash-back. But to jazz it up, they painted their fittings gold. They said: To add a special touch we decided to make all the handles on the wardrobes and drawers gold. We did this by removing them all and spray painting them with a can from Amazon. It cost just £.. They protected the worktops with two rolls of self-adhesive film that they bought at BQ for £. They added: One addition we wanted for the kitchen was some shelves. One of our friends gave us the idea so we could get some cupboard space back, as well as have the ability to rescue some of our nicer ceramic pieces from the back of the cupboards. I’d also seen the idea of a shelf pantry all over Instagram and wanted to recreate it for myself. To find the materials, we searched Facebook Marketplace for people selling scaffolding wood for cheap and we managed to get them for £ a board.  Then we just sanded them slightly, keeping some of the roughness, as that was the look we were going for. We got the brackets off Etsy, and these turned out to be one of the most expensive purchases. We went for some rustic handcrafted brackets made from reclaimed timber and they were £. And they added to the rustic, homely feel by placing items, like an Asda casserole dish for £ and Poundland jars, on top of the wood. They said: Some of the other jars came from IKEA for the pasta, and they were £. each. While we were in IKEA we picked up some faux foliage for the shelves and the tops of the cupboards for around £, and a gold rail for additional wall storage for £. They used sugar soap to wash down the surfaces before sanding them down. By taking off the draw handles, they could spray them gold without causing a mess in the kitchen. They slapped two coats of paint on the skirting boards, ceiling and cupboards. They said: Overall it was very easy to do, it was just time consuming waiting for the paint to dry and hard to get to some of the cupboards to paint them. If we had to do it again, we would take the doors off to complete the job. We had tried to avoid doing this as we thought we might struggle to get them back on. However, it made it a lot harder to paint without getting inside the cupboards too.

Anecdotal reports follow a large outbreak of the Covid iant in the UK.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas been part of a concerted effort to understand Omicron after it was classied as a iant of concern by the World Health Organisation last month, WalesOnline reports. The strain spreads far faster than previous iants, although so far few hospitalisations have been reported.In itsMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , researchers at the CDC have put forward a preliminary symptom profile for Omicron.The report states that a cough is the most common symptom, afflicting  percent of those infected. The authors of the CDC wrote: “Many of the first reported cases of Omicron iant infection appear to be mild, although as with all iants, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes.” “Symptoms would be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV- infection than in unvaccinated persons.  “Characteristics of the cases described in this report might also not be generalisable because case findings might be associated with inidual characteristics. The details of the report draw on the cases of  infections attributed to the Omicron strains. Only seven percent of subjects presented with ‘asymptomatic’ infection or ‘unknown’ symptoms, with  percent of cases deemed symptomatic. “Evenmost infections are mild, a highly transmissible iant could result in enough cases to overwhelm health systems,” wrote the authors where in the report. The report lists cough , fatigueand congestion or runny noseas the three most common symptoms. Shortness of breath , diarrhoeaand loss of taste or smellall featured at the bottom of the CDC’s list.

Posters and hoardings were put up along the route from Digbeth to St Andrewaposs saying Gone But Never to be Forgotten.  There were blue and white balloons and blue smoke poured into the air in a touching celebration of a le cut way too short. Cardf City fans clapped Blues fans as they arrived at St Andrewaposs, where floral tributes and teddies were laid for the little boy. Arthur was tragically murdered by his stepmother Emma Tustin, who routinely beat, isolated, starved and force fed him salt laced meals.  He was also made to stand for up to  hours a day at their home. She is serving at least  years in jail while his father, Thomas Hughes, , was handed a -year term for manslaughter. Birmingham City Football Club produced a special match day programme in memory of young Arthur. For every copy sold on December , the club will donate £ to a local children’s charity.  Fans and well-wishers also took to social media posting their messages of love for the little boy after a heartbreaking video was shared in court where Arthur could be heard sobbing aposnobody loves me.apos Birmingham City supporters posted photos of the hoardings and posters lining the streets of the route, saying: A Little tribute to Arthur. Lot of frantic effort but well worth it. GONE BUT NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN. Brilliant work by those that made this possible.  Birmingham City bosses have also renamed their family zone Arthuraposs Area, which has gone down well with fans. Chris O’Brien tweeted: “Well done Blues. The Peoples Club. Arthur will always be part of the Blues family. Wish he could see all this love he has had and will have.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Football fans\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The display, which s every December, is expected to peak some time during the night of December  and will be visible into the early morning of December . Meteors are pieces of debris that enter Earthaposs atmosphere at speeds of up to km per second, vaporising and causing the streaks of light we call meteors. Geminids are very bright, moderately fast, and are unusual in being multi-coloured. They are mainly white, some yellow and a few green, red and blue, partly caused by the presence of traces of metals like sodium and calcium - the same elements that are used to make fireworks colourful.  The shower is known to produce more than  meteors an hour at its peak, although light pollution and other factors mean that in reality the actual number visible is far fewer. The source of the shooting stars is a stream of debris left behind by the asteroid  Phaethon, making this one of the only major showers not to originate from a comet.  Skygazers will be able to see the display with the naked eye so there is no need for binoculars or a telescope. It is best not to look directly at the radiant as this can limit the number of meteors people can see. Instead, people should look just to the side in a dark area of sky for a better chance of seeing the display.

Her Majesty receives around  daily letters from her fans and it is little wonder she needs a hand to reply to each one. The new assistant correspondence officer will help ensure the monarch’s mail receives a prompt and proper response befitting of the royal crest. As the job advertisement says, many of the posted letters are unique. From a request to send a cat a birthday card, an appeal to overhaul bus stops to save a hairdo and adorable children’s drawings, readers share their stories of writing to the Queen and getting a reply. Would you like to come for tea  Jane Frances’s six-year-old daughter Neve was travelling from Merseyside to London in April  to see a theatre show and thought she’d invite the Queen out for tea. Jane says: “I didn’t want to crush Neve’s dream by not posting the letter, even though I never thought we’d get a reply in a million years.  “Neve was ecstatic when she received a reply from Buckingham Palace. Her Majesty respectfully declined Neve’s invitation, which is perhaps inevitable since the day we were in London was Prince William’s wedding day!” I painted a picture of your favourite horse Shane Hagan felt so much affection for the Queen she felt compelled to send her a painting of her horse Sanction. The -year-old, from York, says she “absolutely loves” the monarch and wanted to give her something back after all she has done for our nation. She adds: “I took up painting after corrective eye surgery and, because I know the Queen loves horses, I painted one of her favourites and sent it along with a Christmas card. “I don’t think anyone imagines they’ll receive a letter back from the most famous woman in the world. “So when I received one, thanking me and encouraging me to continue painting, I was chuffed to bits. Now I’m a full-time artist.” Can you cover bus shelters  My mum is fussy about her hair In , nine-year-old Emma Parsons was so annoyed by mum Jeanette’s hairdo being ruined by rain as they stood at a bus stop she decided to do something. “I thought the Queen could sort this out,” she says. “So once I’d dried out at home, I wrote to Her Majesty to ask for help. I askedshe could put seats and roofs on all the bus stops, but to cover our one first. “My dad, Vince, said I’d never get a reply. Two weeks later none of us could believe our eyes when I received a letter from Buckingham Palace.”  The Queen’s lady-in-waiting explained “it is not within the Queen’s control”, but Emma, now , says: “Soon afterwards the bus stop, outside Cardf Castle, was modernised and I have taken full credit for that.” Civil servant Emma adds: “My parents weren’t sentimental, but that letter was kept and I still have it. My grandchildren are very impressed.” My daughter charmed the Queen with her story about the young Princess Elizabeth A teacher was so impressed by Lottie Trewick’s story of the Queen and Princess Margaret playing in the grounds of Buckingham Palace that she sent it to Her Majesty. And -year-old Lottie was thrilled to receive a reply.  Lottie’s mum Karen, from Winchester, Hants, says: “Lottie wrote the story during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in  and there was a lot of excitement about the Royal Family. “And she was doubly excited to receive a response.  “The letter says: ‘Her Majesty was pleased to see your charming tale about a mighty oak tree which, in your story, became a great fortress for Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret’. “We framed the letter.” Will you send my cat a th birthday card  When Rachel Thomas, of Barmouth in North Wales, heard that the Queen sends cards to those celebrating their th birthday she was keen to remind her not to forget a special centenarian: her cat. Rachel, now , says: “When I was , I realised my -year-old cat Sindy was  in cat years. “So I wrote to Her Majesty asking for a card for my cat. “Her reply said that the Queen can’t send a card to a cat.  “But I was so proud to get a letter from the Queen’s lady-in-waiting that I went around all the classes in my school to show off the letter I had received.” Iaposm worried about koalas Fearing for the impact on wildle during last year’s Australian bushfires, six-year-old Esme Robinson wrote to the Queen to express her concern. Shortly after sending it, the nation was plunged into lockdown and the Queen stayed at Windsor Castle.  Esme, of Herts, lost hope of receiving a reply to her letter sent to Buckingham Palace. A few weeks later she was stunned to receive a special letter franked with the royal stamp. Mum Suzi says: “It was a great moment of excitement at a time when we all had to stay at home.” Get well soon Nine-year-old Summer Wise was off school with Covid in October when she heard the Queen had spent the night in hospital. She wrote to wish her a speedy recovery. Her mum Natasha, of North West London, says: “Summer wrote in her neatest writing and decorated the envelope with stickers and drew a picture of Windsor Castle. Summer told Her Majesty she was also ill and asked her lots of questions.  “She was astounded when she received her reply from Windsor Castle containing a leaflet all about the Queen so she could find the answers to her questions. “We’ll keep the royal reply for ever.” Here’s a chocolate medal  some bunting Three-year-old India Grainger sent Her Majesty a chocolate medal and some bunting to celebrate her diamond jubilee in . Her mum, Hester, from Reading, Berks, says: “India dictated her letter to me and was very specic about what she wanted me to write. She was incredibly excited when we posted it but doubly so to receive a letter back.  “She said she was touched that India had given her a chocolate medal and some flags. And India was over the moon. “The framed letter hangs in our bathroom.” You are the best queen in the whole wide world Keen to bring a smile to the poorly Queen’s face, seven-year-old Chloe Elmer drew her gold and purple crown, her hats and a giant love heart. And in a letter adorned with more hearts and “I love you”, Chloe, of Basingstoke, Hants, wrote: “Dear your majesty, I hope you are fellingbetter. You are the best queen in the wholwide world.” Mum Elizabeth said: “Chloe really wanted Her Majesty to know she was in her thoughts. She even researched the Queen’s favourite colour for the hats. “A few weeks ago we had a letter from the Queen’s lady-in-waiting, thanking Chloe. She was completely shocked and had the biggest smile ever. She’s so proud to know Her Majesty took the time from running the country to write. “Chloe’s letter is a frame on display as a treasure.” We have a race horse you bred Knowing the Queen is passionate about horses, Louise Rowe wrote to give Her Majesty an update one she had bought from her in August . Louise, , from Dorking, Surrey, says: “I wanted to let the Queen know Otago, a horse she had bred, was really happy, doing well and making us proud.  He has won at Epsom twice and I said he had a home for le with us once his career ended. I was thrilled to receive a reply – she wished me well with Otago. The Queen’s letter and card will be treasured for ever.” We are related Student Cameron Holmes wrote to the Queen two years ago to tell Her Majesty: “We’re related.” Cameron, , from Malton, North Yorks, says: “A relative traced our family tree all the way back to the s and discovered that my th great grandfather was King James V of Scotland. I felt I had to let her know.  “Maybe I shouldn’t have been so surprised to receive a reply from Buckingham Palace – we are family, after all.” The letter, which sends Cameron’s family good wishes and includes a genealogical chart of the Kings and Queens of England, is now framed in Cameron’s home. Happy birthday Barnaby Hocking, seven, from Paignton, Devon, made the Queen a nd birthday card while doing art with his dad Dean.  Barnaby’s mum Victoria says: “The day the reply came, with the Buckingham Palace stamp, the postman ran up our drive – he was almost more excited than we were. “We didn’t expect to hear back. For the letter to be so personal means an awful lot. Barnaby was so proud he took his letter to school.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenBuckingham PalaceRoyal FamilyCivil servantsChristmas cards\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But what does it take to step into the big man’s boots A staff shortage at grottos caused by Covid and Brexit means wannabe Santas can earn as much as £ a day. Sounds tempting, right But is it as easy to turn into Father Christmas as it sounds  Here’s how I got on spending a day at a Santa School... In the corner of a London yoga studio is a decorated Christmas tree, wrapped presents, and an ­ominously vacant chair. That’s because the studio is hosting Santa School, where ­volunteers will be put through their boot-clad paces to seethey have what it takes to be Saint Nick. It might sound like a laugh but, as I found out, the training is snow joke.  Leading our course is Ministry of Fun founder James Lovell, a Santa specialist who has been teaching wannabes for the likes of Selfridges since . His first lesson for me is that there is a lot more to the job than you might think. And he has high standards, believing every interaction a child has with Santa must be sensational. He says: “I remember when I met Father Christmas for the first time. It was amazing. I’ve still got the pencil case he gave me. It was at Beales ­department store in Bournemouth. “It has to be an experience that children remember for ever. So I thought, ‘In ­order to make sure that anybody meeting Santa has a magical time, we need to look at what it’s all about’.”  That means giving careful consideration to how Santa looks, how he speaks, and how he should handle tricky questions from kids. After a brief history lesson on the origins of St Nicholas, it’s time to get into his iconic gear. Like Christmas presents, Santa suits available to buy y in quality. The one James wears when he plays Father Christmas features a super-realistic £, beard. Whereas the costume I’m putting on is a little more cheap and cheerful, and features an acrylic wig that makes me look like the drummer from Slade. And while fake Santa bellies are available, I simply stuff a cushion under my coat. Given that it’s a chilly December day, the heating at the studio is on full whack and that makes me hotter than a freshly roasted turkey.  But just like the great man himself, nothing will stop me pressing on – evenI do spare a thought for all the Santas who’ve spent long days in shopping centre grottos in the full itchy garb. It’s then time to practise a few ho ho hos – the trick is to deliver it more as a laugh than a statement – before having a go at role-playing in a grotto. As they say, the proof is in the Christmas pudding. How one handles kids is what makes the dference between an absolute cracker of a Santa and a tree-mendously bad Father Christmas impersonator. James, who acts as a kid in the role-play, tells me before we start: “I’m quite brutal. If people aren’t very good I will tell them. “People have to know. You can’t just laugh it off. You wouldn’t do that with a child sitting opposite you.” No pressure then. I start OK but within a couple of questions I unravel like a poorly knitted Christmas jumper. “Did you get my letter ” James asks me, playing a young boy. I reply: “Yes I did, I enjoyed it very much and put it on the wall above my... magic fireplace.”  My improv skills aren’t quite as strong as I’d imagined. Five more excruciating minutes follow, where, among other ­embarrassments, I fail to recall the names of Santa’s reindeer. James’s verdict: “There was lots that was good about that, though you did go down a bit of a conversational cul-de-sac. “The fireplace… Don’t know what happened there.” He adds: “But you were jolly, so that was good.” My own verdict was that, despite my best efforts, I was ho ho hopeless. The training was put on by network site Nextdoor, which arranged for  volunteers to learn how to play Santa for communities. They acted after finding that % of people are at risk of not ­seeing Father Christmas this year, with % of the country not having a dedicated Santa Claus in their area. Roisin O’Neill, head of community UK at Nextdoor, says: “The reason we’re doing this is we ­believe every neighbourhood ­deserves a visit from Santa.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Father ChristmasChristmasSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was reported that Meghan bought the Queen a singing hamster, which led the monarch to burst out laughing, remarking: It can keep my dogs company. Meanwhile, not only did Meghan impress the Queen during her first Christmas at Sandringham, she also impressed her future brother-in-law, Prince William, with her gt choices.  According to the biography Finding Freedom, she nailed his gt - a spoon with the words aposCereal Killerapos on it. The authors wrote: Meghanaposs biggest challenge was finding the perfect novelty gts to amuse her new extended family. At least one of her gts was a huge hit—a spoon for William that had aposcereal killerapos embossed on the shallow bowl end of the utensil.

Like Meghan, the Duchess of Cambridge was no doubt similarly nervous to Meghan when she spent her first Christmas at Sandringham in . However, rather than hitting the High Street or furiously searching online for a gt for the Queen, Kate came up with an idea for a more personal homemade present - and it appears it went down very well with Her Majesty. Speaking in a documentary to mark the Queenaposs th birthday, Kate revealed what the thoughtful gt was. She explained: I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I thought back to what I would give my own grandparents. And I thought, aposIaposll make her something,apos which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my grannyaposs recipe for chutney. I was slightly worried about it, but I noticed the next day that it was on the table. “I think such a simple gesture went such a long way for me and Iaposve noticed since sheaposs done that on lots of occasions and I think it just shows her thoughtfulness, really, and her care in looking after everybody.

Whether it’s the Christmas work do, a dinner party with friends or a pre-th present swap there’s bound to be lots of merry events. And, unless you’re tee-total you’re probably going to have a tipple or two . But, as we know, alcohol can affect our health in a number of ways – not least including the damage to your liver. If you do want to have a drink over the Christmas period, we’ve spoken to doctors and experts to find out the best options.  Canapost see the sign-up box  Click here. And, it seems mulled wine is a winner.Hussein Abdeh, Clinical Director and Superintendent Pharmacist at Medicine Direct, said: “When it comes to Christmas time, there aren’t many more festive drinks than mulled wine, but did you know that it also has a number of evidence-based health benefits.“Mulled wine is made from red wine, which is known to contain compounds called polyphenols. These compounds are loaded with antioxidants that aid in keeping your blood vessels flexible, which helps the heart to pump blood around the body more easily. “This reduces the risk of clotting and helps to take some strain off the heart. Furthermore, polyphenols help to keep HDLin your blood. “The cinnamon contained in mulled wine is also packed with antioxidants which can help with the physical signs of ageing by reducing oxidative stress in the body.“Cinnamon is also an effective anti-inflammatory and can help to reduce the risk of inflammatory conditions such as Arthritis and IBS Irritable bowel syndrome . This spice can help to reduce levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol while keeping the good cholesterol at a stable level.“The cloves in red wine are able to control your blood sugar levels, which is a serious health benefit as prolonged s of time with high blood sugar can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.”Experts over at Optibac Probiotics added: “Drink vegan red wine. The presence of plant polyphenols in vegan red wine is believed to be particularly signicant: polyphenols have been shown to have numerous health benefits, thought to be due to their ‘prebiotic’ properties.“And, vegan guts will be grateful for the higher intake of healthy plant nutrients! The good news is that vegan red wine is a great source of polyphenols!” Soyou’re looking for a tipple with health benefits then vegan mulled wine could be for you.It should be noted that mulled wine can be high in calories and soyouaposre looking for a lower-calorie alternative opt for light spirits like vodka with low-calorie mixers or even an alcoholic spritzer like Two Brooks which has  calories a can. However, it’s important to note that alcohol is still never healthy. The NHS advises drinking no more than  units of alcohol per week. If you are worried about your drinking or find it dficult to stop then head to drinkaware for further resources or contact your GP for advice and support.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AlcoholChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After months of lockdowns and uncertainty, millions of families were unable to celebrate with their loved ones.That’s why the Sunday People decided this year to lighten the load for one lucky family with a prize giveaway worth over £,, including everything for the perfect Christmas – from a scrumptious dinner to amazing gts.And out of the thousands who got in touch, Emma French, , was chosen as the winner. The mum of two was overjoyed at the news after enduring the same struggles many families have faced in the pandemic. Administrator Emma says: “During the first lockdown I was working from home. My husband Darren was furloughed and took on the role of teacher. “It was stressful but we weren’t the only ones, obviously.” Like countless others, plans to see her extended family over Christmas fell through.  Emma, of Norwich, says: “My sister lives up north and was coming down. Then at the last minute it wasn’t allowed. It was heartbreaking.” That wasn’t the only heartbreak the family faced last year. When Emma’s uncle in Scotland died of leukaemia in the summer, the pandemic put further strain on the loss. Emma says: “He was locked down for his entire illness, then when he passed away we weren’t allowed to go to his funeral. It’s just a build up of woe isn’t it ” Darren, a printer, was also one of Britain’s grafters who had to deal with the precariousness of furlough. Emma says: “It was obviously a pay cut, and his work weren’t topping it up. “It was quite dficult.”  Emma avoided furlough but had to work from home. The family living room became both her office and a classroom to daughters Amelia, , and seven-year-old Matilda. Like many parents, Emma’s experience of teaching while trying to work proved a challenge. She admits: “It was horrible. They’re in dferent years so had dferent sets of homework and dferent online classes.” But learning she had won our giveaway has been the icing on this year’s cake. And no one is more excited than Amelia and Matilda. Emma says: “I haven’t said what’s coming, they just know there’s some treats for them. “It’s like a weight has lted. We were panicking because we haven’t bought food or anything. “We were planning on some kind of Christmas miracle. “We’re really, really chuffed, and the girls are so excited.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sunday PeopleLeukaemiaChristmasCoronavirus lockdownSunday People Christmas appeal\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex made the disclosure in an emotional letter to the family of a fallen comrade, who are fighting to have their son’s name on the national Armed Forces Memorial.The parents of decorated soldier Nathan Hunt had turned in ­desperation to the Duke of Sussex to get their son the lasting honour.Nathan served with Harry in Afghanistan in  but took his own le in  after suffering from severe mental health problems thought to be linked to his military service. In an official letter bearing his ­distinctive logo, Harry said he wishes he could help... “had I been in the same role I once was”.  Although Nathan was a serving warrant officer when he died, defence chiefs have ruled that his name should not be added to the memorial.The family told the Sunday People that Harry’s letter begins by thanking the family for writing to him and sharing what they were trying to achieve in memorialising Nathan’s le.They said Harry then writes that it was an honour to serve alongside many exceptional men and women, and that he was proud to have met Nathan as one of them. Harry adds: “I deeply empathise with what your family is going through and so wish I could assist formally, had I been in the same role I once was.” Before stepping down as a working royal and moving to Calornia with we Meghan, Harry was Captain General of the Royal Marines. After  years in the Army he launched the Invictus Games in , an international sporting event for ­injured personnel and veterans. The prince took part in expeditions with the Walking with the Wounded charity and followed in his mother’s footsteps by becoming a patron to the Halo Trust charity, which helps clear landmines. Last February it was announced that he would give up his position with the Royal Marines along with other honorary military titles. But he remains patron of Invictus and other good causes – and his public support for war-damaged veterans has resonated with many survivors of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.  The family says Harry told them Nathan’s dedication and service is “indelible” and that he will forever remember Nathan as a hero. They say he wrote: “Grief can be a long and burdensome road. “Please know you and your family remain in my thoughts.”Derek Hunt, , and we Maria, , wrote to Harry last month explaining that the Ministry of Defence had twice refused to add Nathan’s name to the memorial in Staffordshire, despite his record for bravery.Harry and Meghan met the Hunts in  during a ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the First World War.  Harry hugged Maria at the event and he and Meghan said how sorry they were to lean of Nathan’s death.Derek, from Lincoln, told how he was deeply moved by Prince Harry ’s letter.He said: “I think the letter shows how much Harry cared about Nathan. He described Nathan as a hero and I think he is very sympathetic to our cause of trying to get Nathan’s name on the memorial. “I didn’t expect a response but after the article appeared in the Sunday People and we sent a letter, someone from his office contacted us and said that Harry would be responding. “I know he has had a tough time in the UK but I don’t care about any of that. You can see from the letter that Harry still cares about the armed forces andhe was able to he would use his influence to help get Nathan’s name on the memorial.” Colonel Richard Kemp, a former infantry commander, added: “Most retired soldiers and officers never forget their service and those they served alongside and will often do whatever they can to help each other after they have left the forces. “Prince Harry is no exception, as this letter shows. Harry deployed on two tours in Afghanistan and fought to do so against great pressure from the Government and resistance from within his own family. For this and his hard work for wounded soldiers – including creating the Invictus Games – he was deeply respected and admired by servicemen and veterans.” Nathan served alongside Harry in  in Helmand as part of a bomb search team in a desert reconnaissance unit while attached to the prince’s Household Cavalry regiment. He was a Royal Engineers Warrant Officer when he died aged . He was found hanged at home in Lincoln on January , . His parents insist Nathan should be included on the memorial, alongside , killed in action or from disease since the end of the Second World War.  Derek said: “Nathan risked his le almost every day in Afghanistan and his actions saved the lives of many soldiers. But it took a toll. He was mentally wounded and those wounds took his le. He was a casualty of war. “The very least the Ministry of Defence could do would be to add his name. Prince Harry appreciated the sacrice Nathan made, it’s just a shame that the MoD can’t do the same. I can’t understand why they are being so heartless. “I don’t want Nathan to be forgotten. I want his daughter to be able to visit the wall, see his name and say, ‘That’s my daddy’.” The names of three other soldiers who served in Afghanistan and died after taking their own lives are on the memorial in Staffordshire. A psychiatric report produced after Nathan died said he had experienced “traumatic exposure” in Afghanistan and had “some elements of PTSD.”  But defence chiefs have ruled that “on the balance of probabilities’ Nathan’s mental health and subsequent death was not linked to his  years of military service. During his six months in Afghanistan the soldier received a Mention in Dispatches. The citation for his award described him as “a superb example of leadership, professionalism and a fantastic ambassador to his corps.” The MoD said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and deeply felt within the defence community. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of WO Nathan Hunt. “Careful consideration is given to each case and the decision not to include WO Hunt’s name on the Armed Forces Memorial does not detract from his service in the Army.” It added: “We are eternally grateful for his service.” Hero braved bombs peril When he served with Harry in , Nathan had one of the most dangerous jobs in the Army. His role was to search for home-made Taliban roadside bombs in Helmand. One wrong move could have resulted in death or serious injury. Then a Lance Sergeant, Nathan always insisted that he should be the main searcher because of his experience, even though others in his team were also trained to detect bombs.  During his six months in Afghanistan he found numerous homemade devices and carried out searches of roads and tracks while being watched and occasionally attacked by the Taliban. The citation for his Mention In Dispatches, reads: “Lance Sgt Hunt has shown exemplary behaviour and a very good example to all. “He demonstrates selfless commitment time and again, putting himself at greater risk to provide the security for the squadron in the face of a very lethal and hidden enemy.” During his  years of Army service, Nathan, a married father of one daughter, also completed tours of Iraq, Northern Ireland and Kosovo.  taken their lives since  Up to  soldiers and veterans are believed to have taken their own lives since . In reality the number of deaths is probably higher because no government body officially records the grim toll. That means no one knows why so many have killed themselves. Many of those who died were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been medically discharged from the Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other veterans developed mental health conditions such as depression and severe anxiety.  Soldiers who served with distinction on the front line struggled to cope with le on civvy street. Many lost their jobs, watched their marriages crumble and turned to drink. It is not surprising that the regiments which suffered the highest casualties in Afghanistan – such as the Rles – also have the highest rates of suicide amongst veterans. The Sunday People began its Save Our Soldiers Campaign when it became clear that veterans with mental health problems were being failed by the Government. Although the access to mental health support for veterans has improved, the number of suicides continues to rise. So far this year at least  have died.  Former Army Warrant Officer Jim Wilde, a founder of Veterans United Against Suicide, said much more needs to be done to reduce suicide rates amongst veterans. He said: “There have been at least  deaths this year but the real number is probably far higher. Many were veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and went on to develop mental health issues. “The fact that the MoD has no idea how many veterans are taking their lives every year is shameful. “Once the size of the problem is known people can set about trying to find a solution. Until then many more members of the military community will take their own lives. “Sadly, this is a time of year when our losses increase due to a sense of isolation many veterans feel.” *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Andrew is understood to have had “little or no discussion” with the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William – despite Her Majesty paying his hefty legal fees. Sources say the Duke of York has been “less than forthcoming” over how he will battle allegations from Virginia Giuffre. Insiders suggest preparations have been coloured by reported infighting between Andrew’s UK solicitor Gary Bloxsome and his newly hired Hollywood hotshot lawyer Andrew Brettler, due to a “severe clash in personalities”. The Duke is accused of sexually assaulting Ms Giuffre on three occasions in , when she was allegedly trafficked by the late Jeffrey Epstein.  The claims come as the trial of his alleged fixer Ghislaine Maxwell continues in New York. Virginia, , is suing for damages in a separate action in the US. The Duke, , has always strongly denied any wrongdoing and vehemently denies the claims. He said in a  BBC interview: “I can absolutelycategorically tell you it never happened.” Andrew’s team must deliver final submissions on Monday. A judge will rule whether a trial is held. One impeccably placed source said: “Everyone from the very top has been left in the dark. The fact there has been little or no discussion with senior members of the family is just mind-boggling.” Buckingham Palace had no comment.

Ian Wileman, , said that his huge collection helped pick him up after losing his beautul primary school teacher we, Michelle. He was forced to make the heart-breaking decision to end le support for his best friend Michelle, .Michelle died after a combination of the influenza virus and scarlet fever led to her contracting sepsis in March, .Ian has collected spiders since he was , but found himself struggling to look after them following the tragedy.Ian told the Liverpool Echo : When I was really not good, shortly after Michelle died, I actually went in the room and found a couple of them had died because Iaposd forgot to water them.I was really gutted, because obviously I wasnapost in a great place, and then losing a couple of animals because I hadnapost gone in and watered them properly, I just felt really guilty.I was in a situation where I thought, aposIaposve got to move them onapos. Five months later, he drove his son Billy to the pet shop so they could match their male with someone aposs female for breeding. But Billy realised this meant the end of their spider collection Ian said: On the way home, Bill was - at the time, he was eight or nine - and he was really upset that there were going to be no more spiders.  So I said, aposOh, weaposll get a couple moreapos. The eight-legged friends have been a huge part of Ianaposs le for decades and without them, he may never have met his we. In his early s, Ian was an iconic animal man who visited schools with spiders and the other animals he had at the time, taking his collection as far as Halax, West Yorkshire. A visit to a primary school in Speke, near Liverpool also planted the thought of going into teaching.  The teachers there just kept saying, aposYouaposve got an aptitude with these kids. The kids love you. Wouldnapost you think about doing it full time  Ian met Michelle in  while they were both training to be teachers at university. On their first date, he jokingly told Michelle he would marry her. He said: She was a beautul, lovely, caring woman. She was everything to me, we were best friends. When she died in March , Ian promised Michelle that he would raise their then-eight-year-old son Billy to be a man with good morals and ethics.  We spent quite a long time on our knees. Le was pretty dire for quite a long time. But these animals kind of give you something , you know, youaposve got , lives in that room that need you to keep them alive. He added: Itaposs a big part of my le. I donapost know what Iaposd doIaposd never had them. Ian also shares his hobby with his son Billy. Around  spiders in his collection of , across belong to Billy, who bought them with his own pocket money. Ian said: Heaposs really, really keen on it.  Itaposs a big part of his le now as well, which shows in the fact that heaposs buying his own and growing his own. I donapost go near it. The spiders heaposs bought out of his pocket money are his. I have nothing to do with them. He looks after them. He feeds them. He waters them. He pots them on when they need potting on. Itaposs down to him to do that. They keep their collection in a room heated between  and  degrees celsius. Both spend hours watching them and looking out for signs that they need feeding, or are shedding their skin, or are ready for breeding. He said: They all have absolutely incredible markings on them. Itaposs like keeping little works of art. They are absolutely amazing things.  He finds it infuriating spiders are portrayed as scary creatures when they are amazing and beautul and worthy of protection. The worst species of spider out there that youaposre allowed to keep, Iaposve got  of them in this house, he said. And theyaposve got medically signicant venom, sothey bit you, itaposs going to hurt, youaposre going to be in pain. Nobody has ever, in the whole history of mankind, been killed by a tarantula bite. Ian added: Thereaposs no reason for anyone to say negative things about them. There are enough people scared of them. Work and his son aside, Ian spends the vast majority of his time with his pets and finds solace in that room in his house. He said: A thousand animals take quite a signicant chunk of your le to look after. But itaposs not a chore, and it never is a chore, because itaposs fascinating to be with them. Theyaposre amazing things. Theyaposre incredible.

Aimee Devenney, from Letterkenny, Co Donegal, Ireland, told her mum Michelle aposMammy I need you to calm me downapos when she felt the attack coming on last December.The -year-old rang her mother for help while staying with her grandparents and later collapsed at the scene, the Irish Mirror reports.She was rushed to hospital however medical staff were not able to save the schoolgirl, despite working on her for two and a half hours. Michelle told Barrscéalta on RTÉ Raidió that her daughter would sometimes suffer a panic attack when she felt an asthma attack coming on. Her daughteraposs request for help was the last time she spoke to her. The mum explained: “They worked on her for a long time. They told me in the hospital that normally they only work on a case like this for twenty minutes, but that they had worked on her for two and a half hours, so I knew they had done everything they possibly could to save her.” And Michelle said that the family are now determined to honour Aimeeaposs memory - starting a fundraiser for two important charities, with over €, raised so far. She continued: We decided to collect money for two charities, the Asthma Society of Ireland, because people don’t know enough about asthma and how dangerous it can be, and Pieta House in Letterkenny. “Aimee spent some time with them, she suffered a lot with her mental health.

Caitlin Platts, whoaposs currently in supported living accommodation in Middlewich, Cheshire, has spent most of the last two or three years moving around hostels or living on the streets. The -year-old, who grew up in foster care, said she went aposoff the railsapos after turning  and began using drugs - mainly cocaine as well as amphetamines and ketamine - which left her aposfinancially ruinedapos. She has now been clean for the last few months and has been offered a council flat in Nantwich after months of bidding via the Cheshire Homechoice social housing service.After being unable to afford utensils and furniture, Caitlinaposs friend Ella Blake put out an appeal for help on a Community Facebook group, askinganyone had any spare items like pots or pans, Cheshire Live reports.But the response was beyond what Ella expected, with people donating a television, kitchen furniture, a wardrobe, bedside drawers and curtains as well as Christmas cards and presents.  The scale of the communityaposs kindness has overwhelmed Caitlin, who initially didnapost even realised Ella had written the post. She said: I was really amazed, I didnapost expect anything like this, I really didnapost. I was just thinking Iaposd be moving into a flat with nothing in it. Iaposm just so, so thankful for what everyone has done. It has given me a bit of hope in people. No-one has ever done this much for me in my entire le. Ella, who works as a carer, said theyaposd been friends for a couple of years and spotted she was moving near where she lived in Nantwich when Caitlin posted the news on Facebook. Ella initially searched Facebook Marketplace before she had the idea of seeking help on the Nantwich Community page. The -year-old said: I donapost think she even knows the extent of how kind people have been. Theyaposve sent her Christmas presents, perfumes, toiletries, a massive TV and kitchen furniture. Sheaposs been on a bit of a journey without a doubt. Hopefully all the trouble and turmoil is coming to end. I think everyone just wanted to give her a bit of a fighting chance. Caitlin has lived a tough le up until this point, growing up in Derbyshire with her mum, dad and three siblings. Her parents struggled with drugs themselves and when Caitlin was seven, social services took the children into care.  My mum and dad were heavy drug users and Iaposve got three other siblings. I donapost think they could cope, especially with being younger parents as well, Caitlin said. We just ended up getting put in care. My mum had no choice. One day we had social workers at the door. We had to pack our stuff and go within an hour. That was it, I didnapost know where we were going. She spent the rest of her childhood in childrenaposs homes, getting aposmoved aroundapos a lot, while she attended school and college. At , she moved into Cotswold House in Winsford - a supported accommodation for homeless people - as she had nowhere  to go. But when she turned  she started struggling with drug abuse and spent a lot of her time living on the streets, including around the Crewe area. When I was  I just went off the rails. I think, because social services werenapost involved anymore, I just felt like I could do what I want, she said. Caitlin eventually ended up at The Limes in Middlewich where she is currently getting help with her drug issues. She is due to sign for her new flat on Monday , said she is looking forward to the next stage of her le. Iaposm just really excited because Iaposve never had my own tenancy before. Obviously Iaposm not going to get as much help as I do here with managing my own tenancy but I think Iaposll get the gist of it, she said. Sheaposs hoping to find employment through the Job Centre as soon as she can and will continue to receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Ella said many of the items given by the community are being stored in her lounge, which she described as currently looking like an aposunderground IKEAapos. She said: Itaposs nice to see that no-one is judging anyone for the circumstances theyaposre in. Instead of putting people down, theyaposre getting behind them and helping out. Nantwich is a wonderful town for the sense of community and the way everyone has really come together for a complete stranger is amazing. It is certainly humbling without a doubt. With everything going on in the world, the fact that the community still works together like this is incredible.

Sue Radford, who has  children with her husband Noel, organised a breakfast to welcome Santa’s elves to their huge -bedroom home in Morecambe, Lancashire.Sue and Noel, , are parents to Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, , Oscar, , Casper, nine, Hallie, six, Phoebe, five, Archie, four, Bonnie, three, and Heidie, one.Sue frequently chronicles the lives of her hefty brood on Instagram and Youtube.In a video shared to the family’s popular YouTube channel, Sue says good morning to her viewers as well as wishing them a “happy first of December”. She turns the camera around to show that one of her younger children is up early with her, dressed in sweet Christmas pyjamas and putting the finishing touches on a huge tree.Sue proceeds to move through the children’s bedrooms, waking them up for them to move out, bleary eyed, to a dining table laden with Christmas cheer.There are stacks of advent calendars - a dferent one for each child - as well as Christmas crackers, plates piled with pancakes, fruit and chocolate croissants, and chocolate santas. In the middle of the table, three toy elves were sitting on a sleigh, which had a balloon attached to it reading: “Special elf delivery to: The Radfords, From: Santa”. As the kids filter into the Radford’s dining room, chaos ensues. While a couple of the kids seem to have tunnel vision for the candy canes laid on the table, most of them are fixated on the fact Santa has brought three elves with him, one more than in previous years. One of the older children asked: “Who wants to name it ”, which led to the younger children all shouting out suggestions. Eventually, the clan decided on the name “Sprinkles”.  The kids get stuck into their choccy milk, Christmas crackers and their breakfast, while Sue moves around the table handing out their respective advent calendars, which appear to be tailored to each child’s taste. They range from a Body Shop advent calendar for one of the older girls, to a gourmet truffle advent calendar for Sue and Noel to share. Eventually Sue moves away from videoing the joy around the breakfast table to do a one-on-one chat with the camera about what  had been going on that morning. In a segment occasionally interrupted by a crying child and a pooch beside her on the couch, she talks about one of the kids’ PE days as well as a panic over not being able to find Hallie and Phoebe’s school trousers.  With the older kids having left for school, Sue then moves around the home showing some more festive scenes, including a Santa sack for each of her children, hanging across a fire place. Sue and Noel Radford have previously said they are proud of the fact that they keep their family going without relying on benefits. Instead, the stars of the Channel  series  Kids and Counting look after their whopping clan with the proceeds from their pie shop and YouTube channel. The sheer logistical enormity of running the Radford family has made them popular and captivating watching. Recently Sue showed off her home after she and her partner Noel put trees up in their living room, kitchen and on their front porch to feel the festive spirit. She wrote on Instagram : “Christmas has landed in the Radford house.”For previous Christmas celebrations, each Radford child has around £-£ spent on them, costing their parents over £, in gts. To make sure there are no mix-ups on the day, Sue has bought each of them a personalised sack to keep them all in. Sue hand wraps each gt she buys and it has previously been reported she can wrap around  presents every  minutes. She and Noel get through around  rolls of wrapping paper each year to cater for their massive brood. The Radfords have Christmas food to budget for too, with just the festive food costing another £. Britainaposs largest family recently welcomed a brand-new addition to their already huge family, as Sue announced that her eldest son Chris has become a father for the third time. Sue and Noel recently claimed that they have spent more than £ million raising their  children.

Large parts of the country will see the mercury get as high as C on Sunday, thanks to a blast of sub-tropical air coming up from Europe.The warmest weather will be in the south east and south west of England, dropping as low as C in the north of the country and into Scotland. And despite the milder t emperatures today, there are two Met Office warnings in place for the very north of the country until Monday. The first warns of potentially dangerous winds hitting northern parts of Scotland from pm on Sunday until am the next day, with a large area subject to a second warning between midnight and noon tomorrow. Brits had best enjoy the warmer conditions while they can, as the numbers will start tumbling back down to single figures again next week. A Met Office spokesman said: On Sunday itaposs a cloudy start for most of us, with outbreaks of rain moving northwards, through Northern Ireland and into southern Scotland. To the south though, across England and Wales skies tend to brighten and there will be some sunny spells developing, with  or  degrees in many places - well above average for the time of year. Where we sees the sky brighten it will be very mild in the south and then it turns very stormy in the far north west later. Itaposs all down to this developing area of low pressure thataposs moving towards the UK, undergoing a rapid deepening process as it engages with the jet stream on Sunday, bringing some very strong winds to the far north west of Scotland. It stays unsettled into Monday with rain in places.  Looking further ahead and with Christmas on the horizon, we should be braced for a chilly Christmas as forecasters predict frost to grip the country. During the festive week, temperatures in the south of England and Wales will plummet on Christmas Eve while frost and fog will sweep across the country on Christmas Day. MET OFFICE OUTLOOK Today: Patchy rain over Wales and central England spreading northwards with some drier and brighter conditions developing to the northeast of high ground. Breezy through the day and mild for most. Tonight: Some mostly light rain, particularly for high ground. Breezy over England and Wales but increasingly windy Scotland and Northern Ireland. Far northwest and far north very windy for a time. Monday: Very strong winds at first in far north otherwise winds easing for most with blustery showers in the northwest. Some rain Wales and central England becoming heavier later. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Unsettled initially. Breezy in the north with persistent, rain arriving in the northwest through Tuesday.

Night sweats are when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet.At a briefing convened by South Africaaposs Department of Health, GP Unben Pillay listed the symptoms that Omicron patients were reporting, ChronicleLive reports. The GP said that he is also seeing patients with the iant presenting with a dry cough, fever, fatigue, and a lot of body pains. He suggested that vaccinated people tend to do much better.The UKHSA has also said it believes the booster Covid jab is essential in protecting against Omicron, though it is too early for certainty as to how the vaccines work against it.However, there are many encouraging signs that the current vaccines will provide some protection against the new strain of the virus.  Early data suggests booster jabs against Covid- do provide an extra layer of protection against the illness. If the iant does undermine vaccine performance, extra protection against the virus might require four or more jabs, possibly with new vaccine formulations — sharpening questions over whether boosting will need to continue indefinitely, states an article published in the journal Nature. The Omicron iant has also further clouded forecasts of how booster campaigns will affect the pandemic’s trajectory.The new Omicron iant of coronavirus is continuing to spread across the UK with cases recorded in the North East. The World Health Organisationhas declared Omicron a iant of concern and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed new measures this week to curb the spread.Face masks will be compulsory in many indoor venues, working-from-home advice has ed and a NHS Covid pass will be needed to get in to nightclubs and venues.It comes as cases of the Omicron Covid iant have been confirmed in Northumberland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough.According to figures released on Friday evening, there were three cases recorded in Northumberland, two in Newcastle and one in Middlesbrough - all based on positive tests from the week ending November .UK Health Security Agency- which released the data - said it expects there to have been more than one million cases of the new iant in the UK by the end of December, and for Omicron to be the dominant strain of Covid within a fortnight.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonNHSWorld Health OrganisationDepartment of HealthPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Civil servant Paula Whitehouse, , from South Staffordshire, UK, bought her home and coach house in . At the time, the house cost £, but had not been well looked-after, with previous owners having stripped away the features that would have made it a listed building, like its neighbours. Paula decided that it was time to bring the house back to le, and rolled her sleeves up to put some character back into the building. It needed gutting top to bottom, she said. Nearly all of the character had already been taken out of our house unfortunately - or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, as we were able to do whatever we wanted. Over the past five years, Paula has spent £, on updating her house and giving it the charm it was missing. Along with her husband Phil, she has entirely remade every room in the house, taking out defunct appliances and redecorating along the way. Paula said the couple worked from the bottom up and tackled things as they broke. First of all they installed a downstairs toilet as it’s a large house that only had one bathroom. They changed the layout of the house like relocated the kitchen into what was the dining room so it had direct access onto the garden.  Other works include changing all of the windows with box sashes, changing the front door and adding a new canopy, insulating the entire property and installing a log burner in the living room. They also updated the heating system. She added: We also installed a new boiler and heating system, ripped out and replaced the bathroom entirely and built and installed the new ensuite. We redecorated as we went, installing new woodwork, new lighting and new flooring throughout. The last thing we did was have a cabinet maker build the alcove unit in the living room. It looks like itaposs always been there.” The only things they havenapost replaced are the roof and the floorboards. All the heavy work is complete and they have moved onto second room makeovers.  Paula’s favourite room transformation is the bathroom, which hadnapost been updated for decades. In terms of style, the couple have completely overhauled the property, bring the bathroom from the s up to date with a fresh botanical-cum-colonial style. Having a free-standing bath has created a real sense of space in what is quite a narrow room,” she said. But the redesign wasn’t always easy, with the pair finding rotten timbers and perished materials that all had to be replaced. Their six-year-old dog, who was a puppy when the project first started, was always running into trouble. Paula added: I was regularly fishing her out of rubble bags or off of freshly painted surfaces. Even though work on the main house is done, Paula still has big plans for the coach house. We have planning permission and building regulations granted on the coach house, so thataposs definitely our next project. Itaposs currently a summer house. Covid, along with astronomical quotes on the work, has meant weaposve paused this for now, but itaposs definitely the next thing on the list. Itaposs a beautul old building with amazing beams, and we want to be able to use it all year round. Even without having finished the coach house though, the property has soared in value since Paula bought it in . The pair bought the house for £k - and after £k of work - it is now worth £k.

If they have any of these ailments, they should think about staying home during the festive period. Boris Johnson has not banned Christmas parties this year but people should still be cautious and be aware the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing.Many of the symptoms are similar to cold-like conditions which people should be on the look out for. Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said those with cold-like symptoms should work from home and avoid parties at Christmas to curb the spread of coronavirus. He told Times Radio, the UK should be “much more open-minded about who we are testing” and “get more people to isolate at least for a few days with cold-like symptoms”.“At the moment, we’re estimating that somewhere between one and three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid,” he said. “And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around. “Sothat transfers to Omicron then we’re going to be compiling that problem much faster than we would need to.”The Liverpool Echo added: “We want to tell people thatyou don’t feel well that day, don’t go out, don’t go to work, work from home, because the start of that snfle, the start of that sore throat, that headache could be a mild dose of Covid that is just breaking through your vaccine.“So I think everyone needs to be much more aware of a whole range of symptoms and not wait for the loss of smell or taste which may never come, not wait for fever, not wait for that persistent cough.” Many of the ailments are fairly unrecognisable and are similar to a common cold. The symptoms to be aware of include: . A high temperature. This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back. A new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours. A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. This means youaposve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normal.  . Night sweats when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet, even though where you are sleeping is cool. . A blocked or runny nose . A sore throat. Headaches . Muscle aches . Sneezing . Pressure in your ears and face The ten symptoms do not mean you have the virus and could simply be a cold. But people area advised to pick up a lateral flow test or go for a PCR testthey are in any doubt they have the virus, particularly since the Omicron strain which is more infectious.

Loralie Henry, , has spent more than half of her le in foster care in Los Angeles, Calornia, in the US. She was first put into foster care when she was four before briefly going back to her biological mum and ing to the system aged six. Loralie said: It was actually really scary, too. I didnapost know what to expect in other homes or what they would feed me. I didnapost really know what to do. So I thought, aposWell, what should I do  Is there anyone waiting for me apos I was really scared. Until I met my mom. My second-grade teacher.  Zoe Henry is a teacher and didnapost have any plans to adopt. The single mum says the moment she saw Loralie two years ago she knew she wanted to adopt her.She added to KABC : She came into my class, and I just took one look at her - her little freckles, her little birthmark.I am going to adopt this little girl. Sheaposs my daughter. The minute I set eyes on her.  Zoe thought the little girl would get adopted by another family, but when that didnapost happen she begged social workers to let her adopt. Loralie went to Zoeaposs house two days later. The schoolgirl said: I remember the moment when we were sitting by the car, sheaposs like, aposYouaposre going to come with me.apos I was so surprised and happy. It was like an early present.  Zoe said Loralie has a lot of obstacles but now she is a brave and strong little girl. She added: She is probably the most compassionate person I know. She wants to be a foster mom someday and adopt kids. On November , which is National Adoption Day in the US, Loralie and  other kids were officially adopted by their forever families.  Zoe added: Biological parents have the right to contest. That did not happen. I know her mom really loves her. I know she really wanted to be a better part of her le. But like I tell Loralie, her mom loved her so much that she would let her be adopted so that I can give her what she needed.Matilda is a  American film based on the  Ronald Dahlaposs novel with the same.The young girl has psychokinetic abilities and comes from a disruptive family.During the film, Matilda forms a close bond with her teacher Honey - who goes on to adopt her at the end.

The teens vanished after leaving Fosteraposs home and their whereabouts have been unknown since. But police in Sparta, White County, confirmed the YouTuberaposs discovery matched the car driven by the teens. Mr Sides shared a video on his YouTube channel aposExploring with Nugapos and said he was lost for words when he found the car.  He said: When I saw two teens went missing and vanished in a car, that really stood out to me. When I looked at the town where they were last seen, I saw that a big river ran through it. That just told me to go. The YouTuberaposs first search was unsuccessful, according to reports. But it all changed after one of the manaposs videos was brought to the attention of White County Sherf Steve Page, who then contacted him to suggest looking at a dferent location along the Calfkiller River.  In a video published at the end of November, Mr Sides described the moment he found a car underwater. He said: Whoa, oh OK, thataposs % a car in front of my face. Iaposve been looking all day, and I finally found a car. The police said officers rushed to the scene as soon as Mr Sides called them, and following an investigation, they confirmed the vehicle matched the one driven by the missing teenagers. Mr Sides said the discovery was overwhelming and, even though he was glad that it could bring closure to the teensapos families, he was sad as it meant they had lost their lives. He added: They have been underwater for  years and no one can come and find them is a very sad situation. We observed that all the windows of the vehicle were open.  Probably the young person driving the vehicle, he lost control of the steering wheel and caused the car to fall into the river. Authorities said the remains located in the car have yet to be officially identied and information will be released in due course. Details of how the car ended up in the river are unclear, but officers think the pair lost control of the car and went into the water as there was no guard rail along the road in . Major John Meadows, the lead investigator in the case, said the teens were his classmates, adding it was humbling to be able to help their families find an answer to their mysterious disappearance. Sherf Page told The Washington Post : We have gone in wells, dug up areas, we have used ground-penetrating equipment looking for bodies.[But] it was right under our noses the whole time. … It’s heart-wrenching to know it was that simple, and it was made that hard because of all the rumours and horror stories through the years. The pairaposs disappearance sparked several theories around Tennessee, with some people suggesting they were murdered, while others claimed they had run away to another state. Following the discovery, Sherf page added: I made a promise to the [Foster] family that as long as I was Sherf I’d be looking for these two kids. I did. I have. Mr Betchelaposs father Ronnie said the discovery of the car made him feel like he had lost his son all over again, adding: It just shattered my heart again. We always kind of thought through the years that something happened, but I just didn’t know what. Mr Sides said: I was very humbled that I could just help out. I would like to think the police did what they could. But this one just slipped through the cracks.

Fteen-month-old dachshund Nala followed her heart and managed to squeeze her way through a narrow gap in the gate. She also maneuvered her way over a large cardboard barrier that was there to make it extra dficult. The loyal puppy wanted to find owner Kiera Vernon, , who was upstairs at the time. Meanwhile, Kiera’s mum, Denise Vernon, caught the puppy in the act and captured it on video. It wasnapost the first time the Vernon family, from Wallasey in Wirral, Merseyside, spotted Nala making bold acrobatic moves. As an attempt to protect her back and stop her climbing, Denise put the strip of cardboard as an barrier and hoped that it would stop her.  But the skilled puppy can climb fairly high for her small size, and is willing to give any challenge a go. Denise, , said: “Nala just wants to be upstairs with my daughter Kiera, and tries everything to get up to see her. She loves Kiera to bits and won’t leave her side whenever she’s at home.” In the video, Nala can be seen pushing her back legs in an attempt to get over the cardboard. With a few kicks she gets over to the other side and takes no hesitation in rushing upstairs to Kiera.  Denise was worried that the amount of climbing would damage her back. Luckily there is an even bigger strip of cardboard put in place to keep Nala downstairs now, which seems to have stopped the sneaky pup’s antics – at least for the time being. For Simba, who also watched Nala’s escape act, and the other family dog, Reggie, there was no hope of them getting upstairs. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family.

But I was amazed at Nala. We just want to protect her back. “I see little cute sausage stoppers for the bottom of stairs that everyone seems to rave about, but Nala would easily find a way of getting up the stairs.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsBabiesDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The graveyard was established back in  making his discovery feel even creepier.He shared the video to TikTok and got over  thousand likes from users who were seriously intrigued by the discovery.The man, named Tarpit, said: “Yikes, look what I found, they felled this tree in the graveyard and I’m here picking up sticks and chips to burn in my kiln. “This is the oldest graveyard in L.A, what is this  We’re opening it right now.” Tarpit focused the camera onto the small box which appeared to be tied up, containing something wrapped up inside. He continued: “It’s all wrapped up, is that a mummy ” after prodding the mysterious object with a small stick. The small figurine-type object appears to be bound with thread or string, and looks like it has been burnt. Tarpit said: “Okay I have seen what I needed to see. Itaposs something tiny all wrapped up in string. And weaposre going to put it back to rest, donapost you think  Many TikTok users have dferent theories as to what this object might be, with one user even claiming it could be a fetus. One user commented: “People used to do that with babies that were miscarried. They would bind them and stick them in trees. Pretty sure that is what you found.” But others had dferent theories as to what it is, with one user claiming that Tarpit had just opened ‘black magic’. It’s safe to say that the internet was pretty creeped out, with many people warning the man about even touching the object. Some were pretty peeved at Tarpit for touching and moving the object, so much so that he felt the need to make a part  video. In the second part, he reburies the object properly out of respect, just in case the ‘mummy’ is an actual person.

The task is already dficult enough when those taking part don’t know each other well, often choosing bubble bath and wine as a last resort. Mathematician Dr. Hannah Fry discusses the many mathematical issues that may occur during Secret Santa in a video by Numberphile. From anonymity violations to derangements, it turns out there’s a fair bit of maths behind the festive fun. She said: “There are fundamental things that you need for the perfect Secret Santa, one is total anonymity and two is that everyone should have an equal probability of being selected. According to Dr. Hannah Fry, the normal way of organising Secret Santa by selecting names out of a hat, fails on both fronts. She explains: “Everybody writes their own name on a piece of paper and drops it into a bowl in the middle.  “That bowl is passed around the table and people pick up names, butthey pull out their own name, they read it and put it back. “By doing that,the last person picks out their own name, how do you solve it without violating the rule of anonymity ” In a nutshell, the last Secret Santa member wouldn’t be able to swap with anyone  without finding out who was buying them a present. Hannah continued: “If you have  people sat round a table, there’s a four per cent chance of them choosing their own name. “It all depends on where you’re sitting around that table, which is where you’re looking for a derangement.” A derangement is defined as ‘a permutation of the elements of a set’, and in this case, will ensure no one picks their own name. Hannah explains: “Say you’ve got three people, A, B and C, say there are six ways that this can be reordered, there are only two extra permutations that could work for Secret Santa.  “The problem is,they’re sitting around a table in order ABC, someone is bound to pick their own name.” So, how exactly does Secret Santa worksomeone is bound to pick their own name  It’s all down to the order in which you’re sat at the table, according to maths-whizz, Fry. She continues: “Say A picks first, B picks second and C goes third. If A picks up their own name they’re going to replace it. “They can only pick two things, B or C. If A picks B, now it’s B’s go, so it’s not going to be an issue for B. “However,A has picked B, and B has picked A, there’s only one person for C to pick, and it’s themselves!” As a solution, everyone involved could wait until the end until they look at who they’ve got and start againthey pick themselves. But according to Hannah, this technique has a  per cent chance of failing and a five per cent of failing more than three times in a row.She added: “At this point, everybody is probably going to be less keen to buy each other presents and want to call it a day. Don’t worry too much though, as there is a solution that’s bound to give you the ‘perfect’ Secret Santa.  Hannah explains: “You create a series of cards that are split in two, at the top of the card you write “you are number ” and on the bottom you write “you are buying for number . “You do this for each person, lay them on a table, shuffle them around and go along with a pair of scissors and cut the cards in two. “At that point, you can create your derangement just by shting the top half of the cards along by one. By doing this, you will guarantee that the top number will not match the bottom number. She concludes: “Everybody will pick up a brand new top and bottom half, then you write a list of all of the numbers in the office and everybody can fill in what number they are. “They now have no idea who anyone  is buying for.” This calculation means that everybody will have an equal chance of buying for everybody . Alternatively, you could make le a lot easier and get it sorted online with a random generator - but we’ll let you decide.

Andthereaposs one person who can attest to this, itaposs a TikTok user known as Nurse JJ.Posting under the username @graysymmetrical, the nurse shares behind the scenes tidbits from her job in the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in the US. Most notably sheaposs gone viral for revealing some of the most jaw-dropping deathbed confessions she claims to have ever heard while working, which include murder, kidnapping and leading a double le.Unsurprisingly some of the confessions are downright terrying and Nurse JJ has said she wishes some people had taken their secrets to the grave instead of telling her as she now has to live with it. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.In one clip, the nurse shares how one patient confessed he had unalived his neighbour because of where he wanted to put his fence. Nurse JJ commented: He creeps into my intrusive thoughts a lot. While she claims someone  told her that they believed their uncle had been involved in a missing personaposs case.She quotes the patient in the TikTok video as saying: This girl went missing  years ago and I think my uncle took her. The sweater in her missing poster was in his garbage.And she explains how another person on their deathbed was a prisoner, who said they had taken the fall for their we after she unalived the woman he had cheated on her with, as he felt guilty.  Some of the other confessions were still bizarre but thankfully werenapost quite so scary. Quoting a patient in a dferent video, Nurse JJ said: I was a hairdresser for twenty years and I kept all of the aposdonatedapos hair to knit blankets with. Similarly, another user reportedly told her how they had been stealing money from their blind friend. A sixth admitted to having two families and shared that they were worried about who would turn up to the funeral. After sharing the first  confessions, Nurse JJ answered some questions on TikTok about them and where they came from as several of her followers had begun to question whether or not they were real. She said: This is a really common question, so thank you for asking it. I appreciate that. All  of the confessions that I posted are things that patients have told me, I canapost speak to their origin, whether they came from a place of hospital delirium, or truth, or anger. Iaposm not sure, but I do know that all  of those affected me in a very negative way and sharing them with you guys actually helps me a lot. So thank you for listening, I have a lot more stories. People in the comments were ided over the confessions, with some fascinated by them but others upset for the nurse as it was unfair to put that on her. One person replied: It is truly unfair that they tell you these things because you have to live with the fact that your patients have done so many messed up things.

Instead of exchanging gunfire, soldiers traded gts and goodwill, all in the middle of No Man’s Land – the ­fragile space that separated the British and German front lines. They even got into the festive spirit with impromptu football matches. Letters to loved ones back home captured the emotion of that Christ­mas Day in  when, briefly, the slaughter was set aside. And the largest ever collection of those letters and photos has been ­gathered together in one of this year’s most moving books, Christmas Truce by the Men Who Took Part. Author Mike Hill says: “It’s all about people to me, that’s what attracted me. It’s an extraordinary human story.” Nearly , British soldiers died during the war, which began in July . As they went into battle, they had been comforted by the assurance that it would “all be over by Christmas”. But, bogged down in the horric trench warfare that would define the conflict, it soon became clear that was not the case. So it is unsurprising that soldiers wrote how they had initially feared that the Christmas Day “truce” might be a trick. Private Thomas Nash, of the East Lancashire Regiment – stationed on the Franco-Belgian border – wrote: “About  o’clock noon the Germans ceased firing… two or three came unarmed out of their trenches, and began to walk towards us saying that they wished to speak to us. “Two or three of our chaps went to meet them, but an officer called them back, suspecting a trap. However, more unarmed Germans came towards us, and our chaps then went out, also unarmed, to meet them, our officers warning them to take every precaution in case of treachery. “A few men were left behind, their rles ready to fireanything happened. I was amongst those who went out. There would be about  or  Germans, and about  of us. “We shook hands and fraternised, exchanging Christmas greetings, cigarettes, cigars etc, several of the Germans exchanging their watc­hes for our jackknives.”  The wonder of warring soldiers laying down their guns to shake hands for Christmas was not lost on the troops. Letters written by Capt John Stansfeld, of the nd Battalion, Gor­don High­landers, show he rushed to get his pocket camera when he realised the remarkable events taking place. Of the scene at Fleurbaix in northern France, Stansfeld wrote: “We found both sides sitting in their trenches, a mutually arranged truce going on. About a mile from us, they were fighting as usual! “Everybody was delighted at the rest and we all got a chance of looking at our trenches and spotting their weak points from the German side – of course nobody went within  yards of the enemy’s lines. “I waved for one of the Germans to come across. But beyond shaking hands and laughing at one another, we could not say very much as we were both ignorant of the other’s language.”  Stansfeld told of taking photos with Germans – knowing he would be in “awful troubleit was known, as we are not allowed to take photos”. For those who could afford one, the Vest Pocket Kodak camera – nicknamed The Soldier’s Kodak – offered a chance to record their adventures serving King and country. Surviving snaps show troops posing together and swapping presents from meagre rations. Concerned that battle scenes caught on film by soldiers could provide intelligence for the enemy – or lead to negative publicity on the home front – a ban on the use of private cameras had been issued by Army chiefs shortly before Christmas . But some either did not get the message or thought it worth the risk. Author Mike said: “There were photographs of the Boer War in the late th century. But the dference here is the accessibility for ordinary people to have cameras. The powers-that-be quickly realised it might not be a good thing.”  As well as trading tobacco, watches and other trinkets, soldiers from both sides joined together in festive singing and dancing. Colonel George Lawrence, commanding the East Lancashire Regi­ment, even proposed a New Year’s Day football fixture. He wrote home: “I saidthey would have an armistice on New Year’s Day we would play them at football between our lines. “At pm our doctor thought he would go and see the Germans, so boldly walked down the road to their trenches and talked to them. “They were very full of the football idea of mine on New Year’s Day. I saidthey would like another armistice then I would turn out a team and play them among the shell holes. “Happily, there won’t be any obstacles like dead Germans lying about unless they try on another attack before then.”  But the match never took place, with a dejected Lawrence writing: “The Germans were not for it, and have been sniping all day.” Mike said while the enduring image of organised matches along the trenches has passed down the decades, they were more likely gentle kickabouts. But he adds that not all the accounts are correct. He added: “Photos that circulate on social media purport to be of games between English and German soldiers but they’re matches between British soldiers and taken much later.” Animosity between the armies heightened in the spring of  after the first horric gas attacks, making later Christmas truces less widespread. But in the century since the guns of the Western Front finally fell silent in , the Christmas truce has remained a touching testament to humanity in the midst of unimaginable horror. Mike said: “It does symbolise the spirit of Christmas. While we shouldn’t forget there were practical real-world reasons why people wanted to get out of the trenches, there was a lot of very human things that went on. “Shaking hands, giving gts, drinking together. It’s all the more touching given what transpired in the next four years.” - Christmas Truce by the Men Who Took Part, by Mike Hill, £ from Fonthill MediaMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ChristmasWorld War IBritish ArmySoldiersArmed forcesSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet she says even she was shocked by the emaciated state of the animals her team saved last week.They moved in after campaigners uncovered an operation to traffic street pups and stolen pets  miles from western Java to Surakarta – where , dogs are killed every month for their meat to be used in satays or stews. Police intercepted a truck at an illegal slaughterhouse in the city at night – and Lola was part of a team of vets and handlers waiting to take in the animals.The -year-old Londoner wept as she told the Sunday People : “It was horrendous. I’ve been to markets, dog meat farms and I’ve met a lot of mistreated animals – but these were truly bags of bones. “One, sadly, had not survived the journey. They’d been travelling for  hours and it was so hot the dogs could barely breathe. They were bound in hessian sacks, soaking in their own mess, and hung in pairs over bamboo poles. “Many had wounds from where their mouths had been wired shut. I’d say % were under a year old.” Police arrested a man suspected of coordinating the shipment of hundreds of dogs every month – killing on average  dogs every day. But it was only the country’s second large-scale raid of its kind.  Lola – who lives in Bali with husband Derek, , daughter Leila, , two-year-old twins Mia and Eloise, and four rescue dogs – says the case has only strengthened her resolve. She works for the charity Humane Society International, heading up its End Dog Meat campaign. HSI estimates that  million dogs are killed for meat across Asia every year. Lola said: “It can be sad and harrowing. Whenever we go away on rescue missions it’s important to come back and hug my dogs very tight.” She has faced “intimidating and sometimes scary moments” in her work across Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. But she said: “People in markets are wielding the equipment they use to slaughter animals –I feel scared, then I think about how the dogs must feel.”  Lola became a vegetarian at seven after seeing a photo of caged chickens and had a makesht “campaigns office” in her bedroom as a child. She said: “I started writing to companies that tested products on animals. I wrote to restaurants that sold veal, ­airlines that flew cats to laboratories – anything I could think of.” At , Lola volunteered at a chimp rehabilitation centre in west Africa. She studied zoology at university, then did a master’s in wild animal biology. Landing a job at the World Society for the Protection of Animals at , she encountered the horric reality of a dog meat market in South Korea.  She said: “Once you’ve seen it, you can never unsee it. This nureongi – a Korean yellow dog – was in a cage with six others and we made eye contact. “I stroked her fur and she licked my hands. It was a devastating moment, there was nothing I could do for her. I made a promise to dedicate my le to ending the dog meat trade.” Just months later, Lola left London to work on the ground in Asia. She moved to Indonesia in  after three years in Singapore. She founded the Change for Animals Foundation, her dedication winning her a prize at the Daily Mirror’s Animal Heroes Awards in .  Lola revealed: “That market in South Korea where I saw the nureongi doesn’t exist any more. It’s been shut down, which is incredible. The sad parts are worth it for the brief moments of victory – like saving  dogs. In those moments, we’re winning.” Last week’s rescue was coordinated by Lola, for HSI, four other charities that make up the Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition and Sukoharjo police. If convicted, the suspect faces up to five years in jail and a fine of around £,. Tarjono Sapto Nugroho, head of investigation for Sukoharjo Police, said the force receives “many complaints” about illegal dog meat traders. He said: “Dog meat consumption is considered culture by some, but cultures evolve and so must we.”  Despite a national government pledge to crack down on the trade, only isolated regional governments there have so far taken the initiative. But DMFI hopes two recent police stings mark a turning point in the campaign for a nationwide ban. Last month a dog trader caught in Kulon Progo district was jailed for  months and fined around £, after being intercepted transporting  dogs. Karin Franken, of Jakarta Animal Aid Network – part of DMFI – warned there is also a public health danger. She said: “Rabies is a grave concern in Indonesia. Where dogs are slaughtered and sold in restaurants, it jeopardises the health of the community.” The rescued pups, currently being nursed back to health at a shelter in Jakarta, will be transported to one of HSI’s rescue centres in Canada. Lola said: “A lot are still traumatised but some are already up and playing with toys and being dogs again. “The lows are low. But the highs like that make the fight all worth it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogsAnimal crueltySunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

may hold off from raising interest rates once more on Thursday due to Omicron fears and new restrictions to control the spread of the virus, according to experts.Having taken financial markets by surprise when it kept rates unchanged in November, the Bank had been widely expected to press the button on a rise from .% to .% this month to rein in soaring inflation.But many economists and investors believe the recent emergence of the new iant and the Governmentrsquos move to impose Plan B restrictions in response has increased the likelihood that the Bank will once more wait and see before taking action.Economic growth could be impacted, albeit not on the scale seen in full-scale lockdowns, while there are fears that more restrictions may be necessarythe iant proves more dangerous.It is set to be a close call among policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee , however, with some economists believing a hike could still be on the cards given rampant inflation.Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ldquoThe new Omicron Covid- iant has complicated the MPCrsquos December decision.ldquoNew restrictions globally threaten to hold up supply chains even more, while consumers and businesses could reasonably be expected to become more cautious to spend.ldquoIf Omicronrsquos economic impact were to prove more signicant than expected, an interest rate rise in Decemberrsquos meeting might have to be quickly reversed.ldquoGiven this, the case for the MPC to not raise Bank Rate this year and wait and see how the economic landscape looks when it next meets in February  is a strong one.Allan Monks at JP Morgan said he believes the latest restrictions could knock monthly economic output by around .% in December and January.This comes on top of supply chain troubles, which are already hampering the UK economic recovery.He said: ldquoThe impact on confidence will be important ndash with people cancelling some spending plans for the future and voluntarily becoming more cautious in their behaviour..removeBut the Bank faces a dficult balancing act as pressure builds on it to help bring inflation back to its % target.Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show another rise in inflation ndash to .% from .%, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.Bank governor Andrew Bailey said last month he wanted to see more evidence that the end of the furlough support scheme had not pushed up unemployment signicantly before hiking rates.Further jobs data due on Tuesday is expected to confirm a hot labour market and rising wages, which may prompt some policymakers to set aside Omicron worries and vote to increase rates.Experts at BNP Paribas believe the majority on the MPC will still vote for a rate rise, although they admit the vote will be ldquofinely balanced.They said: ldquoThe spread of the Omicron iant has added an element of additional uncertainty to the near-term outlook which makes such a move less compelling.ldquoHowever, we think the majority of the Committee will be persuaded by the economic data, which clearly justy the start of the tightening process.Mr Monks said while he believes the Bank will hold fire in the current uncertainty, it will only be a brief pause until its next meeting.ldquoWe would expect any dampening impact from the latest restrictions on currently strong labour market momentum to be brief and modest, leaving the MPC able to follow through with a February rate rise..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Omicron and new restrictions

been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey

So how can the information be called \"confidential\" when childrens details will be spread throughout local authority departments  Moreover, we have seen in the past the details of \"confidential\" research being leaked into the public arena and this latest initiative will turn out no better.Full marks to the local authorities which have refused to take part in the census, a decision which seemingly reflects the mood of the public regarding this assault on our privacy. It also prevents the survey being viewed as a Scotland-wide project which devalues any information gained. Nicola Sturgeon should bin this unnecessary money-wasting and time-wasting census now and draw back from her Governments obvious obsession to control every aspect of our lives.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.THE ISSUE OF CONFIDENTIALITYTHE front-page headline last Sunday was about the Scottish Governmentrsquos health and wellbeing census for schoolchildren not being confidential. The article ulged thatthose analysing the results saw something which suggested a pupil could be at risk, they could alert the local authority. The analysts would not be aware of the pupilrsquos identity. Only the appropriate people in the local authority would have the information. The headline conveyed a dferent impression.This type of \"confidentiality\" is not unknown. Most of us like to think that when we vote in elections our choice is confidential. In fact, should \"those in authority\" wish to find out who we voted for they can do so. I have no recollection of you ever bringing this to peoplersquos attention. It is perhaps being selective in reporting potential breaches of confidentiality.We are all aware of recent cases where children have been abused and murdered by family members. In some of these cases warning signs were there but not picked up by the relevant authorities. Will anyone really take comfort from the fact that neither the victimsrsquo nor the perpetratorsrsquo rights to privacy were breached Douglas Morton, Lanark.SNP INCAPABLE OF LEARNINGTHE SNP is incapable of learning even from its own history. Recycling parts of John Swinneys failed Named Persons Act in another guise just displays this trait.It is even more on show in the endless cycle of new dates for Indyref, which is also a rejected idea.The SNP does not have the breadth of talent to innovate new policies that are genuinely in the interests of the vast majority of Scots. Taking the Greens on board has narrowed options rather than expand them. The headlong rush to carbon neutrality sooner than is practicable will also bear this out.Under the SNP Scotland is demonstrably going backwards. When any governments best defence of failures is to point out that whilst we might be bad, our neighbours are worse , then we are scraping the bottom of the barrel. Will the most inappropriate slogan the SNP ever came up with be not \"Its Scotlands Oil\" but \"Stronger for Scotland\" Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.A WORLD DEFINED BY PAROCHIALISMSO the owner of a small Scottish business, Michelle Maddox of Clootie McToot, receives multiple threats of violence and is labelled a traitor by Scottish nationalists for promoting her products at a festive food and drinks fair at  Downing Street, attended by the Prime Minister.Any reasonable person may want to congratulate her on her good fortune, to be delighted she has an opportunity to promote her business in such a high-profile way, to reach new markets, maybe grow her business and employ more staff in Aberfeldy, where her business is based.But it appears a conspicuous minority of Scottish nationalists dont think like a reasonable person. Their world seemingly is defined by parochialism and so any enterprising Scot looking towards the massive market south of the jurisdictional Border, must be vilied.Boris Johnson doesnt float my boat either but Ms Maddox is out there promoting a Scottish brand and business, and helping drive her local economy. She is to be applauded, not abused.Martin Redfern, Melrose.A SHAMEFUL WASTE OF TALENTIAIN Macwhirter laments the lack of a coherent industrial policy in Scotland and, as a consequence, the catastrophe about to descend on the prospects of the , iniduals employed in the oil and gas sector . He points out that many have already left to work overseas and ruefully observes that Scotlandrsquos biggest export has always been its people.Scottish eacutemigreacutes were previously drawn from the ranks of the dispossessed, but recently it has been those with professional qualications who have gone abroad to improve their lot. That seems unlikely to continue. The deterioration in the quality of education, as measured by unbiased international assessment, means that youngsters in this country are being denied the opportunity to achieve their full potential, whether here or where.This represents a shameful waste of talent among Scotlandrsquos youth and is a shocking indictment of  years of SNP Government maladministration.Bob Scott, Drymen.QUESTIONS OVER ASYLUM SEEKERSJOHN Milnechastises me, but I make no excuses for using the words \"pretend asylum seekers\".If they were genuine they would not pay more than pound, and get into rubber dinghies to cross the Channel. They would instead use the money to buy a ticket on a ferry or use the Channel Tunnel. If they were genuine they would not burn their identication documents or pose as unaccompanied children.These \"pretend\" asylum seekers entered Europe and passed through several \"safe havens\" to get to the UK the land \"flowing with milk and honey\" and free housing. If they feared for their lives, as they now claim, why did they not claim asylum in the first EU country they entered  Once granted asylum status they would then be free to travel to the UK or where.Clark Cross, Linlithgow."},{"url":null,"title":"young-men-choosing-join-fishing-industry","story":"There can be glorious sunsets and the clearest of nights, when the crew of the Sharyn Louise switch off the on-board lighting to watch the northern lights dance or to wonder at galaxies of distant stars.Sometimes when the haddock and mackerel are in an abundance, a passing pod of orcas accompany the crew. There are dolphins, an array of seabirds and even the glittering lights of oil rigs, like Christmas trees towering over the waves.The crew of four - average age just  - are rarely completely alone. Unlike the popular image of gnarled fishermen in soursquowesters battling stormy seas, the weather isnrsquot all bad.ldquoYes, itrsquos physically demanding, says Steven, , one of a new breed of fishers choosing to embrace a hard and unpredictable way of le. ldquoBut itrsquos okay as long as you donrsquot think about it.ldquoSome people think this is tough. ButI had to sit in an office all day, Irsquod think that was hellish too.ldquoI like this. While it can be demanding, frustrating and everything in between, itrsquos rewarding too.Steven has just invested in a third share of the ft long whitefish trawler alongside skipper John Anderson, . The other third has purchased by LHD fishing agents, based in Shetland.Itrsquos a major investment for two young men when Brexit continues to linger across fishing territories, and after pandemic lockdowns saw incomes decimated.With that in mind ndash and the not insignicant issue that trawler fishing is among the most dangerous jobs in the UK - the lure of something less risky may seem far more tempting.Yet they are among a growing number of younger men opting to take on frustrating fishing quotas, Brexit squabbling and the risks of ing home battered and with little to show for it, to invest their futures in Scotlandrsquos often beleaguered fishing sector.They have just received funding as lsquonew entrantsrsquo to the industry from the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million Marine Fund Scotland, intended to help them purchase a second-hand fishing vessel and kickstart their new careers.The lsquonew entrantsrsquo element launched earlier this year as part of a major drive to encourage people under  into the sector, with grants of up to % of the purchase costs of an existing vessel available.In Lerwick, the Sharyn Louisegleams bright red and white, her engine and electrics have undergone a major overhaul as a result of the new bossesrsquo takeover. There have been alterations to improve fuel economy and for handling the catch.ldquoItrsquos like a new boat inside, says John, , whose father and grandfather ran the trawler for almost  years.He could have carried on his original path to become a marine engineer, but the prospect of skippering his own boat appealed more.With a two-year-old daughter, Mia, and his partner, Natasha, at home, he sets off with his crew to spend around four days at a time tracking the best stocks of white fish to sell at Lerwickrsquos fish market.ldquoIrsquove not had any doubts about doing this, he says. ldquoI thought it was worth the gamble.ldquoIrsquom % sure everything will work out okay, but therersquos always that little bit of concern with all the politics and things that our sector ends up involved in.Indeed, relations between Britain and France are in crisis over post-Brexit fishing rights that have seen Paris threatening retaliationministers do not grant more licenses to French boats.Spanish boats, meanwhile, have been embroiled in their own confrontations with fishing vessels off the west coast of Shetland.Yet the string of issues, from quotas to adhering to legislation and paperwork, does not appear to be deterring fresh blood to the sector.ldquoTherersquos certainly a lot more young people coming to the industry in Shetland, I know of two boats this year with young crew taking over from older men, adds John.In his fatherrsquos day, around  white fish trawlers operated from Lerwick, while further back during the lsquoherring boomrsquo, there were hundreds. Now, however, he reckons the number is down to little more than .ldquoMy father got his first vessel when he was -years-old, he says, adding that he attempted to encourage him to stick at marine engineering.ldquoThings are harder now than it was for his generation.

The science doesnrsquot add up with what we see at sea, it makes it hard.ldquoTherersquos an abundance of cod up here but no-one believes the fishermen.On the west coast, -year-old new dad Daniel Watson, has just purchased his own vessel, Integrity, after five years fishing with other skippers.He will work alone, fishing for brown crab, velvet crab, prawns and lobster, leaving Ullapool and working his way towards Mallaig, fishing and selling the catch on the way.Most of what he catches is destined for France and Spain. However, he hopes at least some will land on Scottish tables: helping to re-engage consumers here with the high quality shellfish thatrsquos on our doorsteps is part of what motivated him to embark on a new career.ldquoThere are risks, especially because yoursquore working alone, he says, ldquobut there are safety mechanisms to alert the coastguardanything happens.ldquoAt the end of the day you are out there on your own with ropes going out the back of the boat.ldquoIf yoursquore caught in bad weather it can be a lonely place. But itrsquos a way of le.He does not come from a fishing family ndash his father once fished on a Shetland trawler for a few weeks which was enough for him. ldquoHe thought I was off my head doing this, adds Daniel.His partner Katie, however, was raised in Arisaig by a family steeped in fishing tradition: ldquoShe understands, he adds.His Marine Fund grant arrived in the same week as his new daughter, Rosie, signalling a new chapter for the family on all levels. ldquoIrsquom not going to be taking massive risks ndash Irsquove got too much to lose - but I want to push on and make a better le for my family, he says.ldquoTherersquos a good living to be made andIrsquom working on my own therersquos more flexibility.

Over the course of a few months in the summer, she set personal bests on the track in the m, m and m, all by massive margins.That improvement signaled a signicant leap forward physically but more than that, Keith believes it was a change of mindset that enabled her to take such strides forward.ldquoI used to hate track racing. Really hate it, she says.ldquoIrsquove grown up running in the countryside and in Inverness and I just didnrsquot see the attraction of running round in a circle on a track.ldquoBut in the past year or so, my coach convinced me to take the track more seriously and so we travelled down to races in Glasgow with more runners and that helped me get some good times.ldquoIt was definitely my head holding me back on the track rather than anything physical and now, I actually look forward to track sessions and thatrsquos helped me a lot in my racing.Keithrsquos most notable result over the summer was a fourth place finish in the m in the European Junior Championships, missing out on bronze by a mere three hundredths of a second.She emerged from that championship with mixed feelings and that disappointment has, perhaps, been key to her success this winter.ldquoI had really mixed feelings about the European Juniors. If yoursquod told me beforehand that Irsquod be fourth, Irsquod have jumped at it but when it was so close, it was pretty gutting, she says.ldquoItrsquos a bit corny to say but that has definitely added fuel to the fire for me. I know what it takes now and also, Irsquod like to think I have what it takes.Keith, who has recently relocated to the capital to study sports science at Edinburgh University, is far from a one-trick pony she also represents Scotland and GB in orienteering, with only the fact the pandemic caused far more havoc to the orienteering calendar than the athletics one the reason she has focused so heavily on athletics for the past year.Despite her recent athleticsrsquo success, she still very much has eggs in both baskets. But, with her running going so well, she is likely to prioritise athletics over the coming months and while the Commonwealth Games standard for the m is still some way faster than her current best, her recent rate of improvement suggests nothing is impossible.ldquoI donrsquot have any huge expectations of making the Commonwealth Games but itrsquoll be good to see how close I can get to the standard because Irsquod like to think I can chip a bit more off my PB, she says.ldquoItrsquoll also give me good experience because when the Commonwealth Games come round again in four years, Irsquoll have a much better idea what to expect."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-settle-politicians-rightly-spooked-omicron","story":"Our politicians and the scientic experts are not mincing their words.Following a Cobra meeting between the UK Government and the devolved administrations, Michael Gove, Englandrsquos Levelling Up Secretary, emerged grim-faced and admitted the projected numbers of infections meant Britain was facing a ldquodeeply concerning situation.Nicola Sturgeon warned Scotland - and presumably by extension the rest of the UK - could be facing a ldquopotential tsunami of infections in the coming days and weeks.On Friday, the UKrsquos daily number of Covid cases reached its highest level in almost a year at , as experts warned the speed of Omicronrsquos spread meant the new iant could become the dominant strain as early as next week.The UK Health Security Agency saidthe new strainrsquos growth continued unabated, there would be more , cases a day by the end of the month.In London, % of new cases have the Omicron iant, which was only reported two weeks ago. Its rate of spread is doubling every three, or even two, days.Professor Eleanor Riley, an infectious disease expert at Edinburgh University, said Omicron was spreading so quickly people were ldquovery likely to meet an infected person unless they were ldquoliving the le of a hermit.The most graphic illustration of just how transmissible the new iant is came this week from Jason Leitch, Scotlandrsquos national clinical director, who explained: ldquoIf you have a room of  people and a single unknown Omicron case is in that room, you could in the days after that find ,  or  positives.Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist from Imperial College London, said the UK was already experiencing a ldquovery explosive wave of infection from Omicron, which could lead to ldquoquite an explosive wave of hospitalisations, depending on the severity of disease caused by the new iant. He suggested the peak would arrive ldquosometime in January.While it must be stressed the data remains patchy and more time is needed for precision, the projected numbers are scary. Yesterday, the rest of us got to see what ministers have seen.Government advisers from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine said a best case scenario for England would see a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions they are currently at . The most optimistic projection from now until April  is a total of , hospital admissions and , deaths.Tougher measures like restrictions on pubs and restaurants, the closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on indoor gathering could help control the Omicron wave, reducing hospital admissions by , and deaths by ,.But under a worst case scenario with no extra measures, daily hospital admissions could hit ,, double the January  peak, and over the period to April , the total could top , with as many as , extra deaths.Given these numbers, it is no surprise our political leaders are not ruling anything out. And Downing St, having just announced Plan B measures for south of the border, may soon be forced to consider a Plan C of increased restrictions, including the wider use of vaccine passports as seen on the continent.Last week, Boris Johnson suggested there might be the need for a ldquonational conversation on mandatory vaccines but within  hours Sajid Javid, Englandrsquos Health Secretary, publicly dismissed their use, branding it ldquounethical. Which suggests itrsquos not going to happen unless the PM wants to lose a swath of frontline ministers.On Tuesday a dramatic Commons showdown looms as MPs debate and vote on the new regulations for England.It has been predicted the PM could face his biggest backbench rebellion with more than  Tory MPs defying their leader. Knowing some Cabinet ministers are equally unhappy at the new restrictions, the question is: will any resign Embarrassingly for the PM, his only route to getting the new regulations implemented is on the back of Labour votes another sign of political weakness.And yet the dire situation Omicron now poses could concentrate minds and instil enough fear in would-be rebels to make them hesitate as this weekend the whips go about their business in the art of gentle - and perhaps not-so-gentle - persuasion to change minds.Indeed, Gove, noting how even the double-jabbed could become infected with Omicron, insisted such facts meant fresh action was needed. ldquoIrsquom confident people will examine these proposals seriously, soberly and thoughtfully, andhellipconclude, on balance, it is right to act, he said.One Government adviser, Professor John Edmunds, accepted that the new restrictions, such as working from home, would economically impact businesses like cafes and pubs but insisted they were a ldquonecessary evil.The early analysis that two jabs are an ldquoinsufficient barrier against the latest iant is worrying but, thankfully, three give % protection. However, the problem is only around a third of the British public have had their boosters.The equation of increased transmissibility plus two-thirds of people with inadequate protection equals a dire situation.Even, as everyone hopes, the scientists conclude Omicron is milder than the Delta iant it is replacing, the sheer number of infections could mean coronavirus-stricken patients will quickly overwhelm our hospitals.The race is on to inoculate as many of the five million vaccine refuseniks as possible and to accelerate getting booster jabs into peoplersquos arms.On Friday, , booster jabs were reported, the second highest daily rate, taking the rolling average to a record high of ,. But there is a long way to go in a short space of time.January  could prove to be this countryrsquos most trying time with Covid.

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines.

For these cases, household contacts of close contacts, rather than just the close contacts themselves are being asked to test and isolate.#For non-Omicron cases,you have COVID symptoms you are being urged to book a PCR test and self-isolate until you receive the result.

That means before going to a pub, a restaurant, visiting anybody #s house, or even going shopping.#Concluding, the First Minister said: #If we do all of these things, dficult though I appreciate they are, even with a more transmissible iant, I do really hope we can avoid the need for any further measures.

You would be helping us to save lives.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ldquoThe Covid- booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than  million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas.ldquoThis is our national mission ndash the most recent data shows boosters are the essential defence against Omicron and we are doing everything in our power to get jabs into arms as quickly as possible.ldquoWe are now expanding the offer to over-s ndash so please come forward as quickly as possible to get boosted and help our country get ahead in this race with the iant.Experts from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine , who also sit on the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingor the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , used experimental data to look at how Omicron may transmit as the country heads into , and predicted a large wave of infections in January.On Friday, analysis by the UK Health Security Agencyfound that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provided ldquomuch lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared with Delta.But the UKHSA said a booster dose gives around % to % protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron, as it urged people to have their boosters.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

She said: “Before I was married I attended West Church where I helped in Sunday School, was a GB Officer and Youth Club leader, playing in the Praise Band.”Now a member of Tamlaght O’Crilly Upper Parish Church, Melissa plays piano there every Sunday.She was very active in Glarryford Young Farmers, participating in all competitions - even stock judging - and the highlight was helping to produce the ‘Arts Festival.” She has performed in the Ulster Hall, Millennium Forum and The Waterfront HallA great believer in contributing to the community, Melissa currently leads Tamlaght O’Crilly Community Choir and involved in fundraising for local charities.She said: “Music has opened many doors for me. I started learning the trumpet in P and at secondary school mastered the piano. Ive been involved in the EA Orchestra, Ulster Youth Choir, Ulster Youth Orchestra, Carnlea Accordion Band and Tamlaghtmore Silver Band.”Since taking over as Principal on November  this year, she has been “overwhelmed by the kind welcome she has received from pupils, parents and staff.She said: “I have invested my own children’s education into Kilrea Primary School and now I am delighted to do my part for the school.“I have always been so impressed by the family ethos in Kilrea. Children are welcomed into school like a member of the family.“Staff go above and beyond in their care, teaching and learning. Parents are extremely gracious with their support, time and energy.

We will be asking when we can get supplies of this vaccine in Northern Ireland.“If I lived in Hungary or Serbia, I wouldn’t be having this discussion — because those vaccines are readily available there.”First Minister Paul Givan will tomorrow line up with his DUP colleagues in Stormont to oppose a policy that less than two months ag ohe himself publicly listed as a Covid- related contingency option for winter.The plan, which is signed by the First and Deputy First Minister, lays out options for measures the Executive agreed it could take “to slow the spread of the virus” should the pandemic deteriorate.It included the potential to deploy Covid status certication “in higher risk settings” — yet in the Assembly tomorrow Givan and the DUP will reject the Executive-backed proposal, describing it as a “step too far”.The autumn winter plan states thatcase numbers rise sharply orhospital pressures become unsustainable, it would legislate for certication “ considered appropriate and necessary”.But since its publication the new iant Omicron has emerged — with three cases discovered last week — and hospital occupancy as of Friday was at pc.Among the most vocal politician on vaccine passports is DUP MLA Paul Frew.He believes vaccine passports “will cause deep resentment in the community, increase distrust and hesitancy”.While he has insisted that he is “not anti-vax”, Mr Frew has posted messages on social media saying that he was “totally opposed to government coercion and discrimination”.It follows more than a year of mixed messaging from Stormont’s largest party, with many accusing the party’s MLAs and MPs of confusing the public and undermining the response to the virus.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the attitude of some DUP members throughout the pandemic “has been a disgrace”, adding that “they have actively undermined the public health message at every opportunity”.Most ReadCommunity ‘heartbroken’ after boykilled in Glenavy road traffic collisionTroubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoProperty: superb city living in east BelfastSam McBrideOpinionPaisleyism in the DUP has outlasted its founder, but it is now all but deadPaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Top VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayBelfastjournalist Eimear McGovern test drives electric Volkswagen ID.

Photo: Getty ImagesDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThroughout the pandemic, we have been told our actions and decisions on public health measures will be led by the science.But what happens when even the scientists don’t have the answers At a media briefing with the chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser earlier this week, neither were able to say with certainty what Omicron means for Northern Ireland.They were able to tell us it will likely be the dominant iant here at some stage shortly after Christmas and that modelling is currently being updated to try and forecast its impact.Even with this work ongoing, a Department of Health document this week made some worrying predictions.Prior to the arrival of Omicron here, hospital occupancy was below the least severe scenario, it said.Not exactly a comforting assessment of the current state of the health service.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up More concerning, however, it warned: “It is anticipated that this picture will change rapidly with the emergence of Omicron.”At the moment, we are very much reliant on watching the pandemic pan out in South Africa, where Omicron was first identied.It appears to be infecting younger age groups, but that has tended to be the pattern with earlier iants, and the infection inevitably makes its way into older, more vulnerable age groups.Not enough time has passed yet to accurately assess the impact on hospitalisations and there is some suggestion that Omicron leads to less severe illness than Delta.If indeed this is the case, there are some who have celebrated this as a positive development, but it must be tempered by the real possibility that Omicron is more infectious than Delta.If this is the case, as the maths suggests, the effects would be disastrous.For example,Delta infects , people and % of them require hospitalisation, that would mean  Covid- patients taking up beds.Turning to Omicron,it infects , people and % need hospital treatment, that would mean an additional  Covid- inpatients for a system already stretched to breaking point.The argument for taking quick and decisive action was made on Thursday night, with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, appealing to countries to act now.“Even though we still need answers to some crucial questions, we are not defenceless against Omicron or Delta,” he said.“The steps countries take today and in the coming days and weeks will determine how Omicron unfolds.“If countries wait until their hospitals start to fill up, it’s too late. Don’t wait. Act now.”Returning to the science, this seems like a logical argument to make.We know there is a lag time between infection and hospitalisation, and a further period before patients become so unwell that they require critical care or even die.By the time we get clear answers about the danger posed by Omicron, with a doubling rate believed to be in the region of three days, it will already have a firm hold on the Northern Ireland population.What we do now decides the trajectory of the pandemic in the weeks and months ahead.So, why isn’t the Executive taking more decisive action now to slow the spread of a iant that could potentially cause disaster There are cynics who believe the emergence of Omicron has come at a convenient time to encourage more people to be vaccinated and adhere to the likes of face coverings.But in reality, it couldn’t have come at a worse time for politicians eager to keep voters on side.Here we are, two weeks before Christmas with thousands of people preparing to travel around the UK to reunite with family and friends.At the same time, financial supports such as furlough have ceased and we are trying to rebuild our fragile economy, while also attempting to find a balance between social mixing over the festive period and suppressing an airborne virus.After almost two years of draconian restrictions, people are fed up and an increasing number are rebelling against, ignoring, or simply forgetting even the most basic public health measures.All this at a time of waning immunity and while the health service copes with normal winter pressures, an exhausted workforce and the consequences of spiralling hospital waiting lists.Even a small rise of Covid- inpatients could prove to be too much for the NHS.Yet, move now on restrictions and it turns out Omicron isn’t such a disaster after all and the politicians will never be forgiven by the voting public.However, put in place additional measures now that actually stop the health service from collapsing in January and there will be plenty who will complain the absence of a crippling Covid- wave is proof they were never required in the first place.Isn’t it the case that health minister Robin Swann is still being pilloried for his warnings of a Covid- death toll of biblical proportions as he made the case for lockdown Another factor likely to be playing a role in how the Executive responds is whether Westminster will fund support packages for businesses affected by any measures put in place now.The chances of Boris Johnson loosening the purse strings to cover the cost of our Omicron strategy while similar measures aren’t in place in England are remote.Ultimately, and probably most importantly, who wants to be the politician seen to be cancelling Christmas The Executive didn’t want to do it last year and that was without an Assembly election just months away.Most ReadCommunity ‘heartbroken’ after boykilled in Glenavy road traffic collisionTroubles survivors call on Sinn Fein to condemn Gerry Adams ‘Tiocfaidh ar la’ Christmas videoProperty: superb city living in east BelfastSam McBrideOpinionPaisleyism in the DUP has outlasted its founder, but it is now all but deadPaedophile father given  years for horric attack on his -day-old son ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Top VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayBelfastjournalist Eimear McGovern test drives electric Volkswagen ID.

New restrictions globally threaten to hold up supply chains even more, while consumers and businesses could reasonably be expected to become more cautious to spendMartin Beck, EY Item ClubEconomic growth could be impacted, albeit not on the scale seen in full-scale lockdowns, while there are fears that more restrictions may be necessarythe iant proves more dangerous.It is set to be a close call among policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee , however, with some economists believing a hike could still be on the cards given rampant inflation.Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “The new Omicron Covid- iant has complicated the MPC’s December decision.“New restrictions globally threaten to hold up supply chains even more, while consumers and businesses could reasonably be expected to become more cautious to spend.“If Omicron’s economic impact were to prove more signicant than expected, an interest rate rise in December’s meeting might have to be quickly reversed.“Given this, the case for the MPC to not raise Bank Rate this year and wait and see how the economic landscape looks when it next meets in February  is a strong one.”Allan Monks at JP Morgan said he believes the latest restrictions could knock monthly economic output by around .% in December and January.This comes on top of supply chain troubles, which are already hampering the UK economic recovery.He said: “The impact on confidence will be important – with people cancelling some spending plans for the future and voluntarily becoming more cautious in their behaviour.”But the Bank faces a dficult balancing act as pressure builds on it to help bring inflation back to its % target.Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show another rise in inflation – to .% from .%, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.Bank governor Andrew Bailey said last month he wanted to see more evidence that the end of the furlough support scheme had not pushed up unemployment signicantly before hiking rates.Further jobs data due on Tuesday is expected to confirm a hot labour market and rising wages, which may prompt some policymakers to set aside Omicron worries and vote to increase rates.Experts at BNP Paribas believe the majority on the MPC will still vote for a rate rise, although they admit the vote will be “finely balanced”.They said: “The spread of the Omicron iant has added an element of additional uncertainty to the near-term outlook which makes such a move less compelling.“However, we think the majority of the Committee will be persuaded by the economic data, which clearly justy the start of the tightening process.”Mr Monks said while he believes the Bank will hold fire in the current uncertainty, it will only be a brief pause until its next meeting.“We would expect any dampening impact from the latest restrictions on currently strong labour market momentum to be brief and modest, leaving the MPC able to follow through with a February rate rise.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

The busiest day during the Christmas season this year is expected to be December th, followed closely by December rd. New travel restrictions introduced for arrivals into Ireland, amid fears over the Omicron iant, have made predicting passenger numbers more dficult, Dublin Airport said in a statement. It is expected that some passengers who have already booked will decide not to travel. Dublin Airport has asked those who do travel this Christmas to be mindful of the Covid- rules. “Face masks are mandatory at Dublin Airport and must be worn when in the terminal buildings” the statement said. “In addition, social distancing protocols should be observed and there are more than , hand sanitisers located throughout the Dublin Airport campus. “Anyone planning to greet passengers should arrange to meet them outside the terminal buildings. “There are new meeting points just outside Terminal  and at the glass walkway between the Terminal  car park and arrivals. “It is recommended that anyone who is collecting passengers at Dublin Airport plan and arrange pick-ups in advance.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it.

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs. Sinn Feacutein will continue to work to ensure school unorms are affordable for all families.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Niamh Hawes hasbeen taking part in Miss Bikini Ireland for the last year and achieved a top  spotDerry NewsDerry girl lands top  spot inMiss Bikini Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The man is being treated for abdomen would in Altnagelvin Hospital.Derry NewsMan in critical condition in hospital following Derry stabbing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed.

However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well. It was just that second quarter where we were on top but we didnrsquot take enough chances that would have put the game to bed and we allowed Ramor to live in the game right up to half-time.He added: ldquoWe didnrsquot need to be the best in the country tonight, we just needed to be better than Ramor and I think we were.Kilcoo: N Kane, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Branagan, M Rooney, Anthony Morgan , E Branagan , D Ward , Aaron Morgan, C Doherty , J Johnston , S Johnston , C Laverty, R Johnston, P Devlin .Subs used: A Branagan, T Fettes, M Hynes, C Rooney and J Clarke.Ramor United: L Brady D Bartley, B OrsquoConnell, E Somerville A OrsquoConnell, Jack Brady, M Magee, L Caffrey, E Maguire B Smith, S Cadden, C MaguireJames Brady , A Cole, S McEvoy .Subs used: G Mannion, K Maguire, P McNamee , J Bradley and L Lynch.Referee: Niall Cullen ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"New £65m Lidl supermarket in Carryduff gets green light  ","story":"THE green light has been given for the multi-million pound regeneration of the Carryduff shopping centre which could create  new jobs.The ambitious plan designed to transform the Church Road site mdash which includes a new pound.m Lidl store mdash was approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Monday.Lidl submitted its new store planning application earlier this year and hopes to open the , square metre facility, creating  new jobs and parking spaces for  vehicles, by the middle of next year.In addition to the Lidl store, an additional , square metres of floorspace is available for other retailers at the expansive centre site.The new store opening is a major part of the shopping centrersquos regeneration, which has lain derelict for more than four years, with the planning application proposing the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of three retail units, cafe, bookmakers, drive through cafe, landscaping and associated site works.Parking provision for disabled drivers is included in the development proposal alongside dedicated spaces for parents and children. Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki .

By the time of the  World Cup, when the Northern Ireland heroes qualied for the Mexico finals, I did know that there was a dference between Catholic and Protestant, but only because I had by then become interested in politics, and had begun to read about such things.This ignorance of the tribal ide was a common experience among children whose background was middle class Protestant, and I suspect more common than it was among Catholics of a similar background, because church going levels were far, far higher among Catholics than Protestants until quite recently.In , before the Troubles had begun, already under half of Anglicans and Presbyterians in NI were weekly churchgoers. Among Catholics in NI, it was well over %. This experience is one way of illustrating how wrong Mary McAleese and the late Fr Alec Reid were to say that Protestants were brought up to hate Catholics .But even in , while I had become aware of the ide between Catholics and Protestants, I had not come to think of any such ision among the players the Northern Ireland football team, nor did I — or any of my school friends — spend so much as a moment thinking about the religious background of the other sporting names who gave us such joy in those increasingly distant days, from Alex Higgins to Barry McGuigan to Dennis Taylor..As I became older I thought more and more about how dficult it must have been for NI players of a Catholic backgroundin the s. Tensions were high in the province in the aftermath of the hunger strikes and in the run-up to the Anglo Irish Agreement and republicans were waging a campaign to destroy Northern Ireland.So many of the key figures in the NI team over the decades were from a nationalist background. I have no idea what their political affiliations were,any, and no desire to find out. But there is something particularly admirable about someone who showed loyalty to the Northern Ireland team when they might privately have wanted an all-island team.My thoughts ed to the subject this week when I was asked on the BBC Radio Ulster Nolan show to discuss comments by the former NI manager Michael O’Neill and others that the British national anthem, God Save the Queen, might not be the best song to be played before Northern Ireland games. It is a concern that unionists should take very seriously. It would be awfulfootballers and fans from a Catholic background started to drt away from the NI team — as some have always done but so far in relatively small numbers.I mentioned on Nolan that the News Letter facilitated a debate bout changing the anthem away from GSTQ more than a decade ago. The idea attracted strong opinions among NI fans, both for and against.My own view is that the national anthem is less than ideal for any one of the four home nations because it is the anthem of the UK, rather than any one of its countries.However, finding a specic anthem for Northern Ireland would prove tricky, both in getting something that had musical merit and in finding wording that was acceptable to a broad base of fans.The debate about whether or not to use the national anthem or an NI-specic one is quite separate to the suggestion by the football agent Gerry Carlile that both God Save The Queen and the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann , be played at Northern Ireland games.That would be completely unacceptable, because it would strike at the heart of what the NI team is about — which is a team that represents the northern jurisdiction of this island, the existence of which republicans themselves finally came to accept in .The mere fact of the Northern Ireland football teamspresent a considerable challenge for republicans, because those teams have very widespread and instinctive support, even among people in NI who are apolitical. They are, indeed, one of the last representations of Northern Ireland that are openly embraced.Think of what has happened with the centenary. Republicans have in effect thwarted any celebration, Beyond the front page of the News Letter, barely any local institutions have dared to so much as say Happy th! — not even ones that have Northern Ireland in their name, While London has slightly stepped up its support for the centenary at the end of the year, the anniversary is still largely invisible.

High levels of vaccination among the population will greatly reduce the pressures on the NHS.They make another lockdown much less likely, and further lockdowns are to be avoided at all costs, given the huge social and financial damage that they cause.But the change in the Covid certication requirements in Northern Ireland from Monday are not widely understood and have not been sufficiently publicised. There has been a misapprehension that the old cards, given to people when they got their jabs, are not sufficient as proof.Last night the government said that such cards were sufficient. It would be utterly unfairotherwise. Older people who have been conscientious in getting jabbed often have no access to apps and might not have applied for a letter, which is a cumbersome process. It is fair to ask for proof of jabs in certain circumstances but not fair to make that proof too onerous.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The only thing is he has not listed a qualication in virology. With all his teaching experience he could go back to school and fill a gap for self-isolating and ill teachers.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
