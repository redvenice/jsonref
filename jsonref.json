If her Majesty the Queen does not intervene in some way, we will take this as though she accepts that what is happening to her people in this country is OK.’Alfie’s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, who are both in their early 20s and from Liverpool, asked for a delay, but the judge refused the application following a long battle.Around 200 people protested outside the hospital yesterday afternoon.The petition stated: ‘We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans. The judges in Your Majesty’s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.Over 200 people protested outside the hospital on Monday (Picture: PA)‘For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.‘These cruel orders are not authorized by any law ever passed in a democratic Parliament. Instead, the said judges pretend to exercise Your Majesty’s ancient autocratic jurisdiction over the life and death of your subjects.‘As loyal subjects, we refuse to believe that Your Majesty would ever command such evil deeds to be done and we denounce Alfie’s death sentence and imprisonment as a seditious usurpation against Your Majesty and the law of the land. There is no time to spare anymore.‘We shall patiently await Your Majesty’s royal protection and justice and in the meantime, Alfie’s Army and the good people of Liverpool will not sit back and allow this to happen.‘I can not stop them from now joining up and demonstrating outside Alder Hey again to do their utmost to defend Alfie against all those who prepare to take his life in the next 24 hours.’One person who signed the petition commented: ‘I’m signing this because it is murder.’While another one said: ‘Alfie needs to be given the right to live.’‘But we do need him to be supported… in the next hour it’s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.’A High Court judge is set to oversee a further hearing on Alfie Evans’ case in the next few hours.MORE: New Alfie Evans court hearing set for today after he survives nightMORE: Alder Hey statement on Alfie Evans after life-support machine is turned off"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/aus-foot.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"best aussie anzac day footy moments ever can stream years games live uk","story":"Aussies in the UK have a plethora of patriotic pastimes to pine after barbecues on the beach, avoiding a warm farewell to your beer thanks to a schooner and a summer that lasts for, say, more than three days.Anzac soldiers are remembered each 25 April with a public holiday in Australia and New Zealand (Picture: Getty)But for many antipodeans living abroad, it’s the annual Anzac Day AFL and NRL blockbusters that get us wishing we were at home.Since 1995, the Collingwood Vs. Essendon clash is one of the most important – and humbling – sporting events in the calendar, as is the epic showdown between NRL rivals Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons.So, to celebrate the spirit of Aussie sport – and Anzac Day itself – we have gone down memory lane to choose some of our favourite footy moments ever…David Zaharakis celebrates the winning goal (Picture: News Limited)Few games could ever live up to the drama of the 2009 fight between the two AFL titans. After the Bombers lost David Hille early, they trailed behind the Magpies by 14 points with just five minutes to play.However, thanks to three blink-and-you’ll-miss-them-goals and the scoring abilities of David Zaharakis, then just 19, they stole it back. Unbelievably, it was the first goal of Zaharakis’ career, and marked the match-winning major which has gone down in history.Fox Sports is giving all Aussies the chance to stream the blockbuster games live \u0026amp free from abroad on 25 April – go to Watch AFL or Watch NRL and register to start streaming!

It may have ended in a draw, but Saverio Rocca’s epic nine goal performance set a stunning precedent for the sporting showdown.Dragons fans show their support for Mathew Head after he kicked the winning goal (Picture: Getty)In one of the most exciting endings to a game, Matt Head wowed the 32,000-crowd by chipping and chasing his way to a stunning sideline conversion. Despite a shaky start, Head’s stellar efforts in the last three minutes secured a super-close 26-24 victory – and his place among NRL legends.Brent Stanton of the Bombers kicks under pressure from Martin Clarke of the Magpies during the round five AFL match between the Collingwood Magpies and the Essendon Bombers (Picture: Getty)While Essendon’s Brent Stanton looked like he had secured victory for the Bombers, things turned around in the last two minutes. Collingwood’s Jarryd Blair booted the ball after finding himself in the goal square, and after a dramatic review of his efforts, was the team’s hero as they took home the trophy.Ben Creagh of the Dragons scores a try (Picture: Getty)One of the game’s most nail-biting comebacks was in 2012, when with just four minutes on the clock the Roosters had an eight-point lead over the Dragons. All done and dusted, right? Not if Jason Nightingale, Matt Prior and Jamie Soward had anything to do with it. Their teamwork lit a fire under the Dragons and inside the final minute, Ben Creagh, went on to scored a try, leading the Dragons to win, 28-24.Jamie Soward of the Dragons looks on during the round eight NRL match between the St George Illawarra Dragons and the Sydney Roosters (Picture: Getty)Don’t want to miss out on the Anzac Day matches in the UK?

I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved – from tackling some seriously important storylines to opening up a brand new set and making a smooth transition to six episodes.’Kate’s tenure has certainly got fans talking – with debates raging on whether the show is too dark. But the show has, in recent months, increased the gap between itself and the other soaps in the ratings war and recently achieved a six year high. It was cleared in numerous Ofcom investigations following storyline complaints and has won a number of awards.Storylines have included the grooming ordeal of Bethany Platt, Pat Phelan’s several murders and the high profile exits of Aidan Connor and Eva Price.(Picture: ITV)Kate will be moving on to produce prime time dramas for the channel, starting with the next series of Bancroft. She told us: ‘I am incredibly excited to get started.’In a statement, she added: ‘Being a part of Coronation Street has quite simply been one of the best experiences of my life. I am proud of the stories we have told and the impact they have had – and I’ve had a ball working with one of the best and most talented teams in television. I’ll be forever grateful for this opportunity and all it has given me but I’m also excited to try something new. I can’t wait to make a start on Bancroft, working with the brilliant Sarah Parish and Tall Story Pictures – and I’ll continue to love watching both ITV soaps from the comfort of my sofa.’She will be replaced on Coronation Street by Iain MacLeod, who will transfer over from his role as Emmerdale’s boss. Iain will be replaced at the Dales by ITV Drama Commissioner Jane Hudson who is responsible for the future editorial and creative direction of the soap.Assistant Producer Kate Brooks becomes Producer alongside current Series Script Producer Laura Shaw who also becomes a Producer. Kate and Laura will produce blocks of episodes on a rotational basis and take responsibility for the day to day running of the programme. The Emmerdale appointments will take effect from the beginning of June, to coincide with Iain taking the helm at Coronation Street.Iain said: ‘Working on Emmerdale at a time when it’s enjoyed such success has been a total joy and I will miss the people and the place immensely – it’s a special show full of huge talent.‘Only Corrie could have tempted me away. It gave me my first job in TV as an assistant researcher many years ago and to be returning as producer is the fulfilment of a longstanding dream. It’ll be like a reunion with an old friend and I look forward to continuing the amazing work already being done by everyone connected with the show.’MORE: Coronation Street spoilers: What happens next?

TravelButterfly.Tuesday 24 Apr 2018 8:00 amSafaris are often described as a ‘trip of a lifetime’ so it’s not surprising they have a bit of a reputation for costing a fortune.Accommodation doesn’t come cheap, with most lodges and tented camps (basically glamping) only offering all-inclusive packages.Having dreamed of travelling through South Africa, Namibia and Botswana since I was a child, I was determined there had to be another way to do it.With some research and time to plan, my partner and I made it work.Here are five tips on how to safari in southern Africa on a budget.It may seem like a daunting task but don’t be tempted to book your safari through an agency. They will take a cut of the fare.Instead, research the areas you want to visit (TripAdvisor, blogs and the 4×4 South Africa forum are a good place to start).Most national parks, conservancies and game reserves now have online booking systems and email contact.A home on wheels – complete with rooftop tent, camping equipment and bedding (Picture: Karen Edwards, TravelButterfly)Most three-star lodges cost between £160 and £500 per night depending on location. Safaris and other meals are charged on top of this.Campsites around South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, on the other hand, charge around £10 per person, per night – £50 is the absolute maximum.It is an incredibly rewarding experience, offering you the kind of freedom organised tours do not.Most hire companies offer 4WDs complete with rooftop tent, bedding, camping equipment and a fridge. You only need to buy the food, water and wood for fires. The 4WD doubles up as your safari vehicle, too.Bushtrackers in Johannesburg hire out a single cab Toyota Hilux 4WD, with rooftop tent and camping accessories, from about £77 per day.The most straightforward itinerary is a round trip from Johannesburg, spending four or five days at Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Etosha National Park, Namibia and the Central Kalahari in Botswana.Setting up camp on the Botswanan side of Kgalagadi (Picture: Karen Edwards, TravelButterfly)Pack warm clothing. Temperatures can drop down to -10C at night during winter, but reach 25C during the day.There are no supermarkets inside the parks, so stock up on long-life food, water and booze when passing through big towns: rice, tinned vegetables and baked beans are ideal.We picked up fresh produce in smaller towns nearer the parks. Some camps have shops selling limited supplies like fresh steaks, sausages, bread and milk.Outdoor Warehouse in Johannesburg is great for camping supplies, including hard-wearing water canisters.We bought four which carried five litres each. These can be filled up with bottled water from supermarkets.Fill up with fuel at every opportunity as small towns near the parks run out due to demand.Always carry at least two spare 15-litre canisters.Lions, leopards and cheetahs tend to sleep during the day and hunt at night.The best time to see them is in the early morning (most parks allow you to drive from first light) and late afternoon, so it’s best to set up camp before dark.Most animals tend to hang out around waterholes in the early morning and when the daytime heat has subsided.Buy a guide book on wildlife footprints and droppings (yes, really) – we found many lions by tracking prints and elephants by their dung.Most importantly, when you do find an animal, give them space.Don’t crowd, chase or block their path. Observe them from a safe 30m distance.Finally, be patient. Wild animals have a tendency to show up unexpectedly rather than when you want them to.Some camps are completely isolated. Wildlife-wise, this is incredible, but this is also why it is important to pre-plan your route and stick to it.Give your itinerary to someone at home, so they know where you are each night.Most parks also check you in on arrival. Remember, in most places, you won’t even have phone reception.The heart of Provence: Where to stay during this year\u0027s Tour de FranceOnce it’s saved, this app can be used as an offline map.Print out Google Map routes, along with predicted timings, as back-up.Don’t drive in the dark.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Welcome back to What I Rent, our new weekly series that’s getting rid of the confusion and mystery around renting in London.We’re hoping that by taking everyone inside a different person’s home each week and showing you all the details, we’ll help to answer a bunch of questions everyone has about finding a place to live.How much is a normal amount to pay? How much space should you expect to get in return? Is that level of mould acceptable?This week we’re inside the rented home of Mel Evans, an ex-Aussie who moved to London last year.She’s been there for around nine months. (Picture: Alexander Crawleymetro)Hey Mel! How much rent are you paying?£615 a month, bills not included.How much do you have to pay in bills?Everything is pre-paid, so we’ll whack £40 on electricity every month or so split between four of us, same on gas (which should be drastically reduced now we won’t be using the heaters), council tax is £98 odd a month split again, and then internet is about £16 each a month.And where are you living?Newington Green – that delightful patch of wonder below Stoke Newington, to the left of Dalston, above Canonbury and De Beauvoir and depending on who I’m talking to I have said I’ve lived in each one of these at any given time.What are you actually getting for your money?Four bedrooms and two-ish bathrooms. One has a shower, toilet, sink etc – the other is just a tiny hole that has a shower.(Picture: Alexander Crawley)How long have you been there?I moved in August, 2017. So charging towards nine months. Everyone else lived here another year before that.Do you like it?I LOVE the greater area – Canonbury, the actually green bit of Newington Green.Now the sunshine is out everyone plonks themselves on their patch of green and loves life – and if you’re feeling extra fruity, Clissold Park is only a 15 min walk away where ALL THE DOGS hang out.There are also amazing cafes nearby – with some good Aussie coffee, may I add – and it’s generally a lovely, leafy part of the city with a neighbourhood vibe and lots of Gen Y and hipster families that give the place a little je ne sais quoi.I love how it’s also walking distance to Highbury and Islington, because transport links aren’t that hot around here with no tube, but I am 10 minutes either way to DalstonCanonbury Overground and a six min walk from about 783 buses. You make it work. With a smile.Do you feel like you have enough space?In my bedroom? PAH!Luckily I moved over from Australia with a suitcase and carry on and nothing else, so I didn’t need much space. However, as I continue to build a life here and accumulate more I definitely need more space.(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Also, I’d like to not have to shimmy past my bed, knocking my knees on the bedhead, to get to my miniscule wardrobe, to have the door open and knock over the glass of water teetering on a random, non-moveable concrete block in the middle of my room. *Exhales*In the general house? Love it – luckily I’ve never been one to just hang out in my room, so majority of the time I’m only sleeping in my room and you don’t care about how small your room is when you’re unconscious.How did you find this place?Facebook! Some page along the lines of ‘East London rent’ – so much shoddy stuff, but this place was advertised by an Aussie (with two more in the house) and we had mutual friends back in Sydney, so I assumed they weren’t COMPLETELY bonkers.Do you live with people you knew beforehand?No! This is the first time I’ve lived with randoms (now friends, though, phew, the world is balanced again).Are there any major issues with the house you have to put up with?It’s in an old council block that has a working lift only part of the time (first world issues, I know, but when you’re three flights up carrying heavy shit, the lift would really come in handy) and I sense the sewerage system for the building is on the fritz due to the delightful smells that emanate through our windows.Can you tell she’s an Aussie? (Picture: Alexander CrawleyMwetro)I can also hear my neighbour snoring, so the walls are evidently very, VERY thin. Or he has some serious sinus issues. Apart from that, we’ve managed to turn an old flat into a very homely space for us.Any plans to move again?In the next few months I’ll be looking to move on. The two Aussies are planning to head back home from July, and I’m keen to live in another area of the city taste test another borough.Fancy living in this converted watermill in Hertfordshire?As much as I love the northeast, work is in the west and if I can cut my commute down in any way, even just down to two tubes, I’d be pretty chuffed. But that costs money. Sweet, sweet money.Have you considered buying a place?I mean, I consider it all the time! Will it happen? Not on your nelly!I’m a pretty keen saver, but there’s no way I’d be buying in London.I’d probably look at somewhere out of town as an investment and work my way in…what am I even talking about, this is years off. And several pay rises. And much, much less happy hour cocktails and said-expensive-Australian-coffee.Sounds like a struggle. Now, let’s take a look around Mel’s humble abode…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying.

I was incredulous when I got that response.‘The report said it was “highly unlikely” it was contaminated during the manufacturing process.

stunning colour images","story":"Members of the 22nd Australian Independent Company on their return to camp after a twelve day patrol in the Ramu Valley, Dumpu, New Guinea, 7 October 1943\u0027My grandfather served in the WWII and these images resonated with me,\u0027 he told Daily Mail Australia.\u0027When you look at them in colour, you see how young looking those who served were.\u0027These images allow us to not forget what\u0027s happened in the past.\u0027  The images capture the various emotions of struggle, suffering, happiness everyone was experiencing during the War. By colouring the black and white photographs, Mr Thomas is allowing the viewer a different connection to the image. \u0027I am bringing life to the image which allows you to connect with it,\u0027 he said.Mr Thomas always had an interest in history but it was about three or four years ago when he saw an American and European colourist colouring black and white historic images.He then realised that no one was doing that to Australian history photographs and decided to give it a go.Pictured are Australian officers inspecting the machine guns from Manfred von Richthofen\u0027s (\u0027The Red Baron\u0027)

Day images, I would research the site of the image, look at Google for contemporary images, online museums for colours of tanks, planes, uniform to get a sense of what the colours should be. \u0027There is also some artistic licence where you look at the grey lining and pick the appropriate colour to go with the image.\u0027  Anzac Day marks the anniversary of the Gallipoli landings

including Woody Allen (right in February) on Thursday           Hideaway: Rose has been spending his time cooped up at his Bellport estate (above) in the months since his sexual harassment scandal Rose\u0027s reemergence comes after months spent hiding out at his multi-million dollar compound in Bellport on Long Island, the same estate where he allegedly harassed multiple women.It also comes despite the fact that a new expose is set to hit in the coming week detailing further acts of sexual misconduct that were allegedly committed by the Emmy and Peabody-winning journalist.  Rose is said to be eager to launch his comeback after being fired by CBS in the wake of a Washington Post piece in which eight women claimed they were sexually harassed or assaulted by the journalist.His eponymous interview show was also cancelled by PBS and Bloomberg, who broadcast the program and allowed Rose and his employees to use their Manhattan office. The mourning period seems to be over for Rose however, whose attitude towards the allegation seems to be similar to the one adopted by Allen.In an interview in the November 2013 issue of Vanity Fair, the director\u0027s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow said that Allen molested her when she was just seven.She told the magazine that at the time Allen told her it was their \u0027secret.\u0027Farrow said that she told her mother Mia in August 1992 that Allen had been inappropriate with her in the attic and kissed her, recalling how the alleged abuse made her feel that she was a \u0027bad kid.\u0027She explained that she told her mother because she was \u0027cracking\u0027 and wanted Allen to stop.Allen denied all the allegations at the time and was never charged with a crime.He continues to deny them to this day, maintaining

Rose the exclusive interview after his controversial meeting with El Chapo in 2016 for 60 Minutes. The twice-orced, two-time Oscar winner has been the subject of heated allegations himself, with Madonna accusing Penn of assault back in 1989 according to The Seattle Times. The incident happened after the Christmas holiday, with the paper reporting: \u0027Three days later Penn, frustrated and drunk, staked out the Malibu house. Around 4 p.m., after Madonna had given her small household staff the rest of the day off, he scaled the fence encircling the estate, broke into the house and confronted a terrified Madonna. \u0027After slapping her around, he bound and gagged her, then strapped her to a chair with twine.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/19/4B77B35800000578-0-image-m-181_1524507867432.jpg","title":"ARTHUR favourite newborn prince bookies paying Royal nod legendary king","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

As he was going down my right side, he squeezed my breast using his right hand.\u0027It lasted for a couple of seconds. He covered the whole of my breast with his hand.

Fawcett was an advocate for peaceful protest, using non-violent demonstrations and petitions to MPs. She believed that by demonstrating that women were intelligent, law-abiding citizens then they would be seen to be responsible enough to participate fully in politics.In 1913, Emily Davison threw herself under King George V\u0027s horse at Epsom in a bid to draw attention to the plight of women in the UK.Shortly afterwards, Fawcett made a speech in which the line \u0027courage calls to courage everywhere\u0027 was said.                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/10/4B7C38F300000578-0-image-a-10_1524563958758.jpg","title":"Photographer captures owl hiding inside tree","story":"    The owl showcases its talents as it blends in with the wood and bark encasing it at the Owl Reserve in Hagerstown Castle          Keen photographer Cheuk Kai said: \u0027It was so cute.

Her order included scrub body gel for herself, Lavender shampoo and Honey and Apple lotion for her son, who has sensitive skin\u0027The policeman said that\u0027s fine for you to throw them into the bin.\u0027He put me threw to a manager and he said he doesn\u0027t know why his colleague had told me that. \u0027I would think this is an incident for the police because what if I was a criminal and these passports came to my hands?\u0027 Nicole, who has worked as a legal secretary at a number of law firms, called the US Embassy\u0027s emergency number half an hour later.The Embassy\u0027s Head of security called her back and agreed to send a member of staff to pick up the passports.It took at least four hours before a worker arrived at her home at 10pm.Nicole insisted they bring photographic ID and sign a document stating the handover had taken place.           Her original order had still not been delivered when she called DHL a couple of days later to complain about the incident.

But someone has stuck over the label for the US Embassy.\u0027 She has now criticised DHL for failing to provide a \u0027full explanation\u0027 of the incident, despite her former boss at Hoffman-Bokaei Solicitors asking for one to be provided in writing to DHL Express\u0027s legal department.She said: \u0027None of it makes any sense.\u0027If it\u0027s a simple human error then say it.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/21/4B77D46E00000578-0-image-a-20_1524514802308.jpg","title":"Four sambucas Confused clubber tries order drinks DJ BOOTH","story":"    The woman tried to order the shots four times during the funny clip in a Manchester night clubYolks on him!

Fawcett was an advocate for peaceful protest, using non-violent demonstrations and petitions to MPs. She believed that by demonstrating that women were intelligent, law-abiding citizens then they would be seen to be responsible enough to participate fully in politics.In 1913, Emily Davison threw herself under King George V\u0027s horse at Epsom in a bid to draw attention to the plight of women in the UK.Shortly afterwards, Fawcett made a speech in which the line \u0027courage calls to courage everywhere\u0027 was said.                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/11/4B7BF26E00000578-5650987-image-a-57_1524564702250.jpg","title":"Diary disorder reveals street drinkers blight Britons lives","story":"    A Hull resident has kept a detailed account of how street drinkers are causing a \u0027menace\u0027 to their area.

The painting is one of 22 reclining nudes completed by Modigliani, many of them exhibited at a scandalising exhibition in Paris in 1917. “Together these pictures signal a watershed in perhaps the greatest tradition in art,” said Shaw. “There is nude before Modigliani, and there is nude after Modigliani.”Modigliani is one of only three artists whose work has broken the $150m barrier at auction. Another of his reclining nudes sold for $170.4m at Christie’s New York in 2015. It was bought by the Chinese billionaire Liu Yiqian and his wife, Wang Wei, described by the Financial Times as “one of the world’s flashiest art collectors”.At the time, that sale represented the second highest amount paid at auction behind Pablo Picasso’s Women of Algiers (version O), which sold at Christie’s in 2015 for nearly $180m. They were both overtaken by the $450m paid last year for Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi by the Louvre Abu Dhabi.It would be a huge surprise if the Modigliani got anywhere near to that figure but even so, anywhere close to its estimate represents an eye-catching profit for its present owner who is, according to Bloomberg, the Irish racing tycoon and Coolmore Stud owner, John Magnier. He reportedly bought it for $26.9m in 2003.At 147cm wide, it is the largest work Modigliani painted. The majority of his reclining nudes are in museums, particularly in the US. The Guggenheim, MoMa and the Met in New York own one each. The only one in the UK is in the Courtauld Gallery in London.Shaw said Modigliani was assimilating a world of visual cultures across centuries in the reclining nudes series. “From Egyptian, Japanese, African, Indian and Iberian sculpture, from Renaissance frescoes through Romanticism to the cutting-edge of Cubism.”When the nudes went on display at the Paris gallery of the dealer Berthe Weill there was huge interest. It was closed after a day with one police officer incredulous at the inclusion of pubic hair.Modigliani is the archetypal starving-in-a-garret bohemian artist. He was a womaniser who enjoyed rum, absinthe, opium, hashish and cocaine before expiring as a result of alcohol-aggravated tuberculosis in 1920, aged 35.Nu couché was included in a roomful of nudes at Tate Modern show for the largest Modigliani show ever staged in the UK, and featured on the cover of the catalogue. The painting will be sold in New York in May, part of Sotheby’s big evening sale of impressionist and modern art. The expectation is that, like the previous Modigliani, the buyer will come from Asia.The Modigliani Wang and Liu bought in 2015 was for their art museum in Shanghai. In an interview with the FT (£), Wang said: “We need to collect foreign art so that our museums can be on a par with their foreign peers. Foreign countries have really a lot of museums, big and small, public or private. But we think China is lacking something when it comes to art … Even if we have enough food, we will be empty inside if we don’t have spiritual fulfilment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/836172dab91ce58b9605049dbfdae8f073dfb956/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bef7eac73b8d342a97aeda3438f24d2d","title":"slaver invader tour guide ugly truth empire uncomfortable art tours alice procter","story":"Was Lord Nelson a white supremacist? Was Queen Victoria a thief? Alice Procter take us on one of her Uncomfortable Art Tours, which aim to show how the empire still exerts a grip on British galleriesLast June, Alice Procter started running free gallery tours. She had answered a call-out from Antiuniversity, a project that helps organise radical educational events, and wanted to try out an idea. Her plan was to take people through museums, looking at the ways colonialism continues to influence their displays and the aesthetics of art, and examine the role of empire in funding the spaces themselves. She didn’t think they’d be popular – but they sold out.The MA student now does Uncomfortable Art tours at the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum, the V\u0026ampA, the National Maritime Museum and Tate Britain. “My parents took me to museums when I was a kid,” says the 23-year-old, “so I’ve always been very comfortable in art galleries. I have experience as a tour guide, I fit the profile of the typical young white girl who’s an art history student doing a guided tour. And I can use that.”Why the empire? “I have always been interested in the art of the British empire. I’m Australian and I grew up understanding there is a multiplicity to historical narratives. So I was aware that history is always just storytelling. I feel fairly confident in spaces like this, and coming in and telling stories in them, because I know that’s just what the building is. A building.”The group who have turned up for today’s sold-out tour at Tate Britain are mostly white, mostly female and mostly young, something Procter says is typical. She also gets “arts students, people who work in education, and museum people who want to know how to do this sort of thing in their own institutions. Which is nice.”It quickly becomes clear why Procter’s tours have done so well. Rarely using notes, she clearly knows what she’s talking about, mixing the historical context with present-day reflections on everything from corporate sponsorship to the Legacies of British Slave-ownership project at University College London. She also interrogates how the Tate displays the work, as well as the labels with information she suggests is glossed over or even unmentioned. The tour, starting at 11am and lasting only an hour, is a quickfire look at select paintings and sketches from the 17th and 18th centuries. We begin with Elizabeth I, when “ideas of Britishness began to be defined”, and continue until the abolition of the British slave trade in 1833. It’s fascinating. We see William Hogarth’s sketches for A Rake’s Progress that, Procter explains, are filled with elements an 18th-century audience would have recognised as caricaturing and demonising everything deemed foreign. Later, she uses a William Beechey painting to point out the similarities between Sir Francis Ford’s anti-abolitionist arguments and the sentiment you sometimes hear today that British charity should begin at home with “the white working class” as opposed to abroad. She doesn’t shy away from politics, mentioning issues such as Brexit and handing attendees free badges saying: “Display it like you stole it.” Her website is equally blunt, containing portraits of fine-looking gents with words such as “murderer” or “illegal immigrant” scrawled over them in red.This tour is relatively quiet. Procter says attendees “tend to be a lot more conversational” – but it’s clear the people agree with her. They are vocal, too, nodding and murmuring words such as “awful” whenever she mentions slavery. At times, it’s a little like an echo chamber.“You kind of know what you’re signing up for,” she says, “so I tend to get people who broadly agree with me.” Is this a good thing? She sighs. “I think it’s a thing. There are better places to have arguments over whether the British empire was good or bad than in an art gallery. The point of these tours is that they’re educational. So yes, people who come broadly agree with me, but they’re coming because they want to know more.”Shamma, who is studying at the Royal College of Art and is originally from Dubai, says: “I did like the tour. I wanted to hear more, but there’s a lot of information and not much time.” Shamma admits to feeling “a little uncomfortable” as the tour went on. “I look at the techniques, and I’ve been so ignorant about how disgusting some of these works are. Suddenly I felt ashamed, like, ‘Oh, I don’t want to look at this any more.’ But I think it’s necessary.”Procter has high hopes for the future. “At the moment, the tours are run from my kitchen. It’s just me, but they’re growing. I want to start working with other people, help people develop their own tours of different sites, get out of London, work with school groups. There’s so much I want to do, but I’m studying and suddenly this is a full-time job.“My hope was that people could come and it would be a bit of a wake-up call. Then they would go and find more information.” However, those aims have changed. She hopes extra knowledge will encourage people to be more vocal, so that galleries will change everything from how they display work to what they put on the label. “That’s my bigger aim.”• Find out more about future Uncomfortable Art Tours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908c54519960df6be327d49b742e8f0860ae5070/0_0_3549_2363/master/3549.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2d1a583f364197bcaa2b6600c32af816 960w","title":"london nights exploring capital after dark in pictures","story":"Fusing portraiture, documentary, conceptual photography and film, London Nights will reveal the capital after dark through photographs from the late-19th century to the present day.

I know! Amazing, really. It’s baby-shaped, as far as we can tell under the blanket, and appears more than capable of doing things newborn babies generally do, such as lying there. It may do other baby-like things soon, such as having a name. More as we get it.And yet let’s not be churlish here. The reason pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge on the hospital steps still resonate for many – achingly fashionable as it is to wish the whole circus would just go away – isn’t just that they evoke fond parental memories. It’s that being pregnant and having a baby even of the non-royal variety is such a weirdly visible thing to do. Everyone feels a sense of ownership when you’re pregnant. Everyone feels the need to ask inappropriately intimate questions or pat the bump or offer advice about going back to work, plus in some cases bare-faced nagging dressed up as attempts to be helpful. The world’s cameras may not literally be trained on every new mother, but at times it damn well feels like it.The day the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth, pregnant women could look forward to side-eye in Starbucks amid reports that drinking more than one coffee a day might be bad for the baby (never mind that it is based on one study from Norway describing a very slightly elevated risk of having an overweight child, and the causation has been described as “weak”). Then over that guilty flat white, they could read all about how one in four hospitals now refuses women’s requests for a caesarean delivery for anything other than clinical reasons. This is despite guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence that says women should have a choice, even if they have endured grim vaginal deliveries previously, or are terrified of the process, or even if they are just grown adults who, having read up on all the risks, were mad enough to imagine they might have some say.NHS patients quite properly make choices all the time about which form of medical intervention suits them, yet nobody is ever described as being Too Posh To Choose Conservative Management Over Radical Surgery For Slow Growing Cancer it is only the routine choices that women make over childbirth that attract such intense public debate and censure.Yet at times parenthood comes to feel like one long process of being invited to defend and explain choices that aren’t really anybody else’s business. If a grown woman is confident wearing heels when pregnant, in the full and certain knowledge that there might be an infinitesimal risk of falling over in them, then who are you to stand between her and the pleasure of dressing at least one part of her body in something recognisable from a previous life? Who cares which bit of your body the baby came out of, so long as everyone’s alive and well at the end?Performative parenting of the achingly middle-class kind – the sort that involves dragging an oblivious toddler round a museum, talking at the top of your voice about educational things just so everyone knows what an excellent parent you must be – may be exceptionally irritating to witness, but it’s a defence mechanism deep down, an insecure reaction to that feeling of being silently judged.There have been endless calls for royal births to be treated more like the ordinary, mundane events they really are to be politely ignored, not plastered all over rolling news. But honestly, there is a reasonable argument that it should be the other way round, and that every single woman who has given birth deserves to come out of hospital to the works: a faux town crier and Kay Burley in full cry and someone reverently erecting a golden easel outside the house, which anyone who will be spending the next three weeks sitting on a rubber ring knows damn well they have earned.But given the practical difficulties of granting everyone their own 16-page commemorative tabloid pullout, many new parents would settle for the other thing royal mothers now get from the media: a very particular sort of scrutiny from strangers, which at least bends over backwards to be kind. One that focuses chiefly on how well the children behave at weddings, considering their age, or how sweet they look in their dressing gowns and one which is increasingly afraid of being hammered on social media if it’s seen to judge too harshly or harp on about when mum is losing the baby weight. The Duchess of Cambridge isn’t the only one who deserves a break."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/732de0af45fad46299aef1aa10c8727bbdad269c/0_90_4471_2683/master/4471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9bda6812930433082e29c235638dca","title":"uk universities erosion integrity bologna statement","story":"The Bologna statement, which defines the very purpose of universities, doesn’t seem to apply to the UK any moreIn 1988, to mark the 900th anniversary of the founding of the University of Bologna, Europe’s oldest university, 388 rectors and heads of universities drew up the Magna Charta Universitatum. This was a brief general declaration of the nature of universities and their purpose.The first principle was: “The university is an autonomous institution at the heart of societies differently organised because of geography and historical heritage”. The second fundamental principle was: “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life, and governments and universities … must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement.”The Bologna statement was an affirmation of an ideal transcending national frontiers. Its principles were reaffirmed in a 1999 document establishing the European Higher Education Area, signed by the education ministers of 29 European countries, including the UK.Viewed from the everyday experience of a British university two decades later, these principles can ring hollow. “An autonomous institution”? Barely a month goes by without a new diktat issuing from Whitehall and its satellite agencies. Governance is as constrained as policy. One recognised expression of autonomy is for academic staff to have a say in who is appointed to the roles of deans, pro-vice-chancellors, and vice-chancellors. In British universities – unlike the majority of their European counterparts – that doesn’t happen.Another institutional expression of autonomy would be a senate that had effective control of academic and intellectual policy, but that body has been bypassed or abolished in nearly all UK universities.“Freedom in research”? Tell that to the colleague compelled by their research excellence framework manager to focus on a particular line of inquiry. Or tell it to the heads of department obliged to enforce the targets set by the pro-vice-chancellor (research) for the amount of money to be brought in by each member of staff through external grants. The mantras “accountability” and “performance management” mask the disturbing extent of institutional bullying in so many British universities.It has long been recognised in most university systems that academic freedom and academic tenure are two faces of the same coin, with appropriate legal protections to match. In Britain, however, tenure was abolished by the Tories’ Education Act of 1988. But academics still have de facto tenure, don’t they? Tell that to those who are made redundant as a result of the latest piece of managerialist restructuring.In Britain we are used to hearing a lot of sub-Burkean blather about how written constitutions are only needed by those countries that don’t have our practical wisdom and good judgment. But the truth is that genuine academic freedom in British universities is in a parlous condition. Not because uniformed commissars are frog-marching outspoken academics off to jail (not that there are that many outspoken academics in the first place). It is more a matter of the daily erosion of intellectual integrity, the relentless commodification of scholarly values, and the tightening grip of managerialist autocracy. And no one can seriously believe that any of this will be improved by leaving the EU and submitting to the unregulated embrace of global capitalism in its most buccaneering and profit-hungry form.Anyone tempted to dismiss these points as the alarmism of disappointed idealists or other malcontents should read the sober and detailed survey of academic freedom across Europe by Terence Karran and Lucy Mallinson. When measured against a range of standard criteria, including legal safeguards and de facto practices, the UK came bottom of the 28 member states of the EU. Similarly, the definitive text book The Law of Higher Education declares that “in terms of the health of academic freedom, the UK is clearly ‘the sick man of Europe’”.So they may soon have to rewrite the Magna Charta Universitatum. “The university is an autonomous institution (though not, in practice, in the UK …).” “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life (though, funnily enough, not in the UK …).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2043b74a5f807ade490e21d6470727206edb5556/0_271_5841_3506/master/5841.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9964512e7bec40bed85ff93bdb8ca501","title":"hard brexit would mean more and cheaper british fish but theres a catch","story":"Exclusive: Taking back control of UK waters would lower the price of British-caught fish, new analysis shows – but most of the fish we eat is importedA hard Brexit that banned EU fishermen from UK waters would lead to many more fish being landed by British boats and a corresponding drop in prices, according to new economic analysis.But there’s a catch. Two-thirds of the fish UK consumers eat are imported from overseas, and the costs of those would rise, due to the trade barriers resulting from a hard Brexit. Moreover, the fall in the price of UK fish would lead to a drop in earnings for UK fishermen. Overall, the analysis shows closing the UK’s sea borders would be a “lose-lose situation” for both UK and EU consumers and fishing industries.The issue of fishing has become one of the most highly charged Brexit issues. The current EU system is perceived as unfair, with vessels from other EU nations landing 10 times more fish from UK waters than vice versa. Ministers have said UK boats will catch hundreds of thousands of tonnes more fish after Brexit. But fishermen have repeatedly expressed fears that the ministers will not “take back control” of UK waters, but instead will trade away access to British waters in exchange for access to other markets. In March, the UK government angered the industry by conceding that EU fishing rules will remain in place until 2020.Furthermore, the UK imports almost twice as much fish as it exports, with the top five being cod, tuna, prawns, salmon and haddock. The impact of a hard Brexit on trade would make these more expensive, the researchers found. The impact would also hit UK fish farms, which export most of their products, and the fish processing industry, which relies on imports.She said the apparent opportunity for the UK to “cash in” by closing marine borders is scotched by the analysis. “Overall, the advantage of an increased fish access is completely outweighed by the costs of protectionism,” the report concluded.Prof Bryce Beukers-Stewart, a fisheries expert at the University of York, UK, said: “What is interesting is they have taken a very broad view, unlike a lot of the other analyses.” This includes assessing impacts on both the UK and other EU nations, examining how changes in wild fisheries impact on farmed fish sales and how prices change.”It shows a familiar story – that the implications of Brexit are so much more complicated than the simple campaign message of ‘taking back control’ led people to believe,” Beukers-Stewart said, adding that he thinks a total ban on foreign vessels is unlikely as things stand.The increased fish caught in UK waters by UK boats in the hard Brexit scenario would be species such as blue whiting, herring and sand eels, Beukers-Stewart said: “There is not a huge appetite for these in the UK, to put it mildly.”But fisherman Aaron Brown, founder of the Fishing for Leave group, disagrees that the UK would lose out from a hard Brexit: “We regain approximately 600,000 tonnes net from a clean Brexit. Prices may drop short term but eventually they will recover as the UK processing industry also rebuilds.”“If the UK regains what should be rightfully her resources, implements new UK policy to address both EU and domestic failings, then the future can be very bright for British fishing,” he said.Helen McLachlan, at WWF-UK, said the new analysis held no surprises: “We import most of what we eat and export most of what we catch.” She said a good Brexit transition could see new rules enabling both a healthy ocean and a thriving fishing industry.The WUR analysis employed a widely used economic model and also tested to see how much changing the necessary assumptions affected their conclusions. The overall “lose-lose” outcome of a hard Brexit in fisheries remained in all circumstances, with only the scale of losses being different. “We have good trust in our results,” said Bartelings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86f60caf143f61648f8fc0041d34244cad2f093b/0_93_4586_2751/master/4586.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=162967aa5647dfb30f8220f209115257","title":"fashion revolution week seven ways to get involved","story":"Want to join the campaign to improve conditions in clothing factories? From showing support on social media to picking up a needle and thread, it is easy to helpFive years ago, the issue of where our clothes come from went from being a matter of curiosity to something more urgent. It was on 24 April 2013 that the Rana Plaza disaster occurred on the outskirts of Dhaka in Bangladesh more than 1,130 people died after the factory building in which they were working collapsed. The disaster galvanised Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro, co-founders of Fashion Revolution, into action. Fast-forward to now and it has grown into the world’s largest global fashion activism movement. Their campaign is simple. They are urging the industry to take more responsibility and show greater transparency in the supply chain. If brands do not know what is happening in the factories that supply them, if is difficult for them to improve conditions. Fashion Revolution asks one question: who made my clothes?There are many ways to support the campaign. By holding our favourite brands to account, it is possible to create change that minimises the risk of such a disaster recurring. Here are seven ways to get involved. Take a selfie showing the label from a piece of your clothing – or just take a picture of the label, if you are not a selfie fan – then post the image on social media with the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes in the caption. It is amazing how brands sit up and take notice. They might even be able to answer your question. Increasingly, companies are taking the issue of transparency seriously, but there is still a long way to go. “Too many people working in the fashion industry, mostly women, are still underpaid, unsafe and mistreated,” says Somers. “It’s time for change.”The director MJ Delaney has made a short video to spread the Fashion Revolution message. It features music by Richie Fermie and choreography by Christopher Bordenave. You may already have seen Delaney’s work – she made What I Really Really Want, a remake of the Spice Girls’ Wannabe video promoting gender equality for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and last year’s follow-up for International Day of the Girl, to the soundtrack of Beyoncé’s Freedom.Delaney’s film For Fashion Revolution uses various styles of dance to represent each step of the complex journey of a piece of clothing from cotton field to factory floor. Wear the Walk is the fashion equivalent of Netflix. Choose a one-off rental (starting at £30) for a special event, or a range of subscription services, starting at £60 per month, which allow you to choose two items and swap them each month (the fee includes dry-cleaning and insurance). This is a trend set to grow. According to a report by Allied Market, the global clothing rental market was worth $1bn (£700m) in 2017 and is estimated to reach $1.8bn by 2023.Of course, you can always freestyle. Make your wardrobe go further for free by taking part in swaps – there is one happening in Manchester on 27 April – or circulating parcels of clothes among your friends. Check out the tool kits to help you on your way at Global Fashion Exchange. Fashion Open Studio is a Fashion Revolution initiative that is – full disclosure – curated by me. A week-long series of events, workshops and talks, it is the opposite of a catwalk show. The public are invited to designers’ studios, where they can talk about how they make clothes, learn skills and even try making their own. Highlights include a talk by Vivienne Westwood’s head of couture and a visit to the Kent HQ of Elvis \u0026amp Kresse, to see how they are working with the Burberry Foundation on finding creative solutions for working with leather offcuts. Alternatively, try a repairs workshop with Christopher Raeburn, quilting from waste with Phoebe English or making your own clutch with Katie Jones and Wool and the Gang. To sign up for an event, visit Fashion Open Studio.De Castro says the small decisions we make every day are important. “Our wardrobes are a part of the fashion supply chain, so we can make a positive difference every morning when we get dressed,” she says. We have a responsibility to look after our clothes, wear them well, keep them in circulation and not throw them away after a few wears. We might even sew a button back on here and there mend a hole. We need to treat our clothes with respect and keep them in circulation so that, ultimately, we buy less, waste less, reduce the amount of textiles we are sending to landfill.Glasgow School of Art is hosting MEND, a workshop to learn how to repair your clothes, on 24 April. Also, De Castro will be with recent fashion and textiles graduates Matthew Needham and Maddie Williams, showing how to think creatively with existing clothes at Barnardo’s Brixton DiscoMAKE in London on 26 April. Tickets are available on Eventbrite.Truman Brewery in London will be a utopian parallel shopping universe this week, filled with brands and clothes you can trust. Organised by fair trade activist and pioneer Safia Minney, the founder of People Tree and now the CEO of vegan footwear brand Po-Zu shoes, there will be events, talks and guilt-free shopping. While you are there, you can invest in a pair of Po-Zu’s linen and pineapple “leather” sneakers, along with the latest collections by People Tree, knitwear by Lowie and menswear by Brothers We Stand. Ask any of them who made the clothes and they will be able to tell you. We hope that one day this will be the norm. For times and details of events, visit the Facebook page.To mark its fifth anniversary, Fashion Revolution launched its manifesto during Fashion Question Time at the Houses of Parliament on 23 April. It covers everything from fair and equal pay to freedom of association for all workers to cultural ersity and transparency and accountability across the entire chain.De Castro says: “We want your signature to be a part of a global legacy, so that every time something is unjust, or people are exploited and the environment is degraded, you can reach back to it and reiterate that you can’t stand for abuse, you signed the manifesto, you are ready for change.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a80a2ed820a51b94555f3e906d05561ddbc91c/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6169411252fdbe02a682d3d57fea0264","title":"the rachel divide review netflixs dolezal documentary is a troubling watch","story":"A controversial figure is the subject of a thought-provoking yet problematic film that prioritizes a white woman’s feelings over the damage she has causedRarely has a film been so uneagerly anticipated. When word got out that Netflix was releasing a documentary about Rachel Dolezal, the controversial white woman who identifies as black, many people were furious. Understandably so. Getting a movie made about your life because you appropriated blackness and then lied about it seems like peak white privilege. What, large swaths of social media wanted to know, was Netflix thinking?A cynic might say they were thinking that controversy equals free publicity. Netflix’s own defence of The Rachel Divide was far more high-minded, of course. Last month Netflix responded to the backlash about the documentary on Twitter, stressing that the film isn’t just about Dolezal but explores her “life as a microcosm for a larger conversation about race and identity”.I’m not sure this is accurate. The Rachel Divide is a fascinating and thought-provoking film. But it is also a reminder that the “larger conversation about race and identity” always seems to find a way to prioritize white feelings and center white stories. While the film is not an all-out defence of Dolezal, it certainly pushes you to sympathize with her. The documentary starts, for example, by showing you the extent to which Dolezal has become a pariah in Spokane, Washington. There was a time when Dolezal was a well-respected figure in the city she served as the president of Spokane’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 2014 until June 2015. Things fell apart, however, when it was discovered she’d been lying about her race. She was also widely suspected of lying about being the victim of racial hate mail. Now Dolezal, whose lies many people believe set back the work of the NAACP, is very much persona non grata, subject to abuse and suspicion wherever she goes. What’s bitterly ironic about this, as Sandra Williams, a Spokane journalist points out in the film, is that Dolezal is finally getting an authentic taste of the African American experience: she’s being “treated the way black people are treated when we raise issues”. She doesn’t seem to like it much.We then e into Dolezal’s childhood, which seems to be the root of her identity issues. After having two children of their own, Rachel and her older brother Joshua, Dolezal’s parents, we are told, felt spiritually guided to adopt. Because it was quicker and easier to adopt black children, they ended up with four African American kids who they raised, as Dolezal’s adopted sister Esther puts it, as “white people with skin conditions”. It was Dolezal who took on the job of trying to teach the children about their race. During this process she seems to have convinced herself that she too was black. Dolezal’s parents, Larry and Ruthanne, it would appear from the documentary, mistreated all their children terribly. Esther, for example, demonstrates scars she still has from being beaten with a glue gun and baboon whips. She also says she was sexually abused by Joshua Dolezal – for a while he faced charges for this abuse, but they were dropped in 2015. One reason the case was dismissed appears to be the discrediting of Dolezal, who has claimed that her brother also sexually abused her. The problem with Dolezal is that she has been caught out in so many lies that no one can really believe a word she says anymore and this has had a profound impact on lives other than her own. It has certainly had a devastating effect on her children’s lives, particularly her 13-year-old son Franklin. While just a teenager he comes across as more thoughtful and self-aware than his mother. “If all this had to happen, I wish it had happened when I was older,” Franklin, says at one point it is heartbreaking. He also pleads with his mother to stop trying to tell the world that she is black. “I really do not want to focus on this for the rest of my life. Why don’t you just let it go away? ... This is going to affect more than just your life.” Did Netflix have any qualms, I wonder, about bringing more attention to Dolezal and her family? Did they think how it might affect her children? For every one person who watches the movie and feels compassion, a handful are simply going to see Dolezal trending and spout more abuse at the family. Again, it is difficult to shake the feeling that the documentary is an exercise in prioritizing a white woman’s feelings over the damage she has caused, not least to her own black children. That the director, Laura Brownson, is a white woman is not, I think, an insignificant fact. Ultimately, I’m not sure The Rachel Divide really interrogates the reasons why Dolezal is so isive, so much as it whitewashes them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb37829b41d7c2b7351eec83b618c48161dcecb/0_36_4512_2708/master/4512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bdfc4cbb06f7f9fee21ee53d0db4ea8","title":"leeds united disgraceful myanmar tour yangon","story":"• Myanmar subject of numerous human rights abuse allegations• Leeds to play games in Yangon and Mandalay in MayLeeds United have announced they will play two matches in Myanmar in a tour sponsored by a bank with close links to the regime accused of ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses against its Muslim Rohingya minority.Leeds will play two post-season friendlies in May in the Myanmar cities of Yangon and Mandalay.Since August 2017 a campaign of violence, described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing and as genocide by Amnesty International, has been carried out in the northern state of Rahkine in Myanmar.The military has razed villages, killed men and abused women and children, resulting in more than 700,000 people fleeing over the border to Bangladesh.The Myanmar military and government, including de facto leader, the Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, have denied responsibility for the violence but recently the top UN human rights official called for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court. In a damning statement the organisation representing the Rohingya community in the UK described Leeds as “disgraceful”, adding: “Leeds United FC is going to play football on the grounds soaked in the blood of innocent Rohingya children, women and older people.”Leeds will play an all-star team from Myanmar’s National League and then the national team, on a tour sponsored by AYA, a private Myanmar bank implicated in ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. AYA bank is owned by the Myanmar tycoon Zaw Zaw, who was blacklisted by the US for being a crony of the former military regime. He is a close ally of Suu Kyi and the government, and is thought to be one of the biggest funders of a controversial programme to rebuild Rahkine which is thought will have little benefit for the Rohingya community if they are allowed to return. The Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani, has business interests in sports media firms operating in south-east Asia.While fans expressed concern over aligning the club with Myanmar, the Leeds managing director, Angus Kinnear, defended the decision and said the squad “are very excited for the chance to represent the club in Asia”.Kinnear added: “Myanmar is one of the fastest-growing nations in south-east Asia and is passionate about English football. “They have ambitious goals for grassroots and elite football development that we are delighted to be able to support. This tour gives us an opportunity to meet new fans of football who will hopefully support our journey back to the Premier League in the coming years.”A Leeds spokesman said the club was liaising with the Foreign Office and would avoid any areas of conflict.

Can Roma stop Mohamed Salah and can Liverpool defend set plays?A key factor in Roma’s success against Barcelona was Eusebio Di Francesco’s switch to a 3-5-2, having fielded a 4-3-3 in every other game bar one this season. It not only wrong-footed Barcelona but meant Roma had three against two at the back and in midfield, something that was possible because the two wing-backs, Alessandro Florenzi and Aleksandar Kolarov, had the energy to drive back Barça’s wide men, Sergi Roberto and Andrés Iniesta. It forced them to defend rather than tucking in to offer support to the two central midfielders, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic.That had two principal benefits. First it meant Juan Jesus could step with confidence from the backline to deal with Lionel Messi, knowing he always had two players behind him who had just one central forward, Luis Suárez, to contain. It also meant that at the back of midfield Daniele De Rossi, protected by Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan, had time and space to make the play. And that is why this match will be so different from Roma’s task against Barça.Quite apart from anything else there is no chance that De Rossi will have as much time on the ball as he had then. The sight of him measuring his pass over the defence for Edin Dzeko in the second minute as no one closed him down should shame Barça. Whether that was a facet of their attitude or a conscious decision to release Suárez and Messi from defensive responsibility, it allowed Roma’s creative fulcrum to go about his business unchallenged. Roberto Firmino will not allow it.Liverpool will be aggressive, fearsomely so, in their press and how Roma handle that will go a long way to determining whether they have a chance in the game. The worry for Di Francesco must be the way Tottenham – after their dozy 10 minutes in Turin and before their dozy 10 minutes at Wembley – were able almost to bully Juventus in their last-16 meeting, something that confirmed the impression the Premier League is a different level from Serie A in terms of pace and power. Even more concerning must be the fact that, aggressively as Spurs press, Liverpool are far more ferocious. As well as everything else this will be a serious physical examination.As for shape, there would seem little obvious benefit for Di Francesco in opting for a back three again. It might conceivably offer greater defensive cover and, appealing as the thought of having Juan Jesus on the left of three central defenders to block Salah’s incursions from the Liverpool right may be, it causes far more problems elsewhere.Firmino’s habit of dropping deep means that having two players to pick him up is probably one and a half too many, while Sadio Mané’s pace makes him ideally suited to exploiting the space behind a wing-back. To play a back three would be to risk the wing-backs being driven back and it becoming a back five, which in turn would essentially surrender the flanks to Liverpool’s attack-minded full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson. And that would make certain a disparity that already seems likely in midfield, where Roma’s obvious quality risks being overrun by the greater pace and energy of whichever trio Jürgen Klopp selects. Di Francesco is more likely to opt for his familiar 4-3-3, sitting the back seven relatively deep to frustrate Liverpool.Dzeko, who has been in fine form, is the outlet, operating in a role in which he thrives as the roving lone front man, although Liverpool have been less vulnerable in the air since the arrival of Virgil van Dijk. Saturday’s draw against West Brom, albeit with a much-changed backline, demonstrated that foible has not entirely gone away. With Dzeko and Kostas Manolas on hand Roma have the aerial power to trouble Liverpool from set plays.The job of Roma’s wide men, two of Florenzi, Diego Perotti, Cengiz Ünder and Stephan El Shaarawy, is to support the midfield while shuttling forward to back up Dzeko. At the same time they must apply sufficient pressure on Alexander-Arnold and Robertson to make them at least slightly cautious about committing to attack.The danger for Roma is they end up overwhelmed, befuddled by an early Liverpool storm into retreating into a bunker. Although Roma have yet to concede at home in the Champions League this season, Liverpool are so lethal on the break there is a realistic expectation they will score at the Olimpico and that almost certainly means Roma will have to score at Anfield. As the Barça game proved, silly as the away goals rule is, it can be decisive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf7c5bc8f3a9ce7663b681f09c5302b1250aafd0/588_188_2299_1379/master/2299.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9770af709596be34da58f62034bf6fc5","title":"world cup stunning moments clive thomas denies zico and brazil","story":"With six seconds of stoppage time played, Clive Thomas blew his whistle a moment before Zico scored to beat Sweden – a decision which reverberated around the world“Uncontroversial, non-dictatorial and magnanimous are not adjectives I would associate with Clive Thomas,” wrote Clive White in the Times in April 1981, after “a ludicrous penalty award” had handed Wolves a last-minute equaliser against Tottenham in an FA Cup semi-final. “There is a view that the best referees make themselves as inconspicuous as possible. I am not sure that Mr Thomas shares that belief, because the star performer before an audience of 50,000 and millions more peering through the keyhole of television was unquestionably Mr Thomas. It was the Clive Thomas Spectacular Show.”Three years later David Lacey described Thomas in the  as “one of football’s better referees”. Yet “when controversy has thrown its arms around Clive’s neck he has tended to linger lovingly in the embrace. What Clive does have is a keen sense of history. The fall of Jericho would have been delayed while Thomas booked the wall. At the Battle of Copenhagen Nelson would have been cautioned for dissent. At Waterloo Blucher would have been sent off for entering the field late and without permission.”In April 1977 Thomas took charge of another Cup semi-final, a Merseyside derby, in which he disallowed a perfectly good late winner for Everton – for handball, though he admitted that “in no way could I have seen the ball make contact with his hand or his arm” – because he wasn’t sure what else Bryan Hamilton might have used to ert it into the net (it came off his hip). In the 1981 League Cup final he allowed a 117th-minute Liverpool goal even though the ball passed just over the prostrate and clearly offside Sammy Lee, dismissing his linesman’s raised flag without consultation.Then there was the game between West Ham and Birmingham City in February 1974, a tense encounter between two sides battling relegation. The game ended 0-0, but Thomas’s officiating inspired the crowd to launch into a chorus of the then-popular terrace anthem, Oh, Oh, What a Referee! And Thomas joined in with gusto. “There I was on television, singing away,” he wrote. “Ken Aston of Fifa was at that match and he told me I’d had a good game, but I wonder if he saw me doing that singing. I feared that that was not the sort of thing they were looking for.”Aston, it turned out, was far from offput. Thomas became the second-youngest referee at that summer’s World Cup, and though he took charge of only two group games he was involved, in a manner of speaking, throughout the competition. Referees were still emphatically amateur, and Thomas paid his bills by producing and selling referee’s equipment. And so it was that every official in Argentina sported the Clive Thomas Kit, composed of Terylene shorts and Crimplene jersey. “His experiments with kit,” the  enthused, “have helped to invest the ranks of referees with a little more elegance.”By the 1978 World Cup Thomas was 41 and in his prime, if no longer in the kit supply business (he worked for an office cleaning company at the time, heading to Argentina with a pledge to make footballers “keep it clean”). To say he failed to enjoy the tournament would be an understatement: in his autobiography Thomas described it as “a month of disillusionment with football administration, my colleagues, the organisation of set-pieces, the general politics of the game and the behaviour of some of those at the highest level” it was here that he was to ascend to international infamy. In his book he describes the moment for which he is now best remembered as “probably the most controversial decision that any referee has ever made, a decision which reverberated around the world”.His first assignment was a group game between the 1958 finalists, Brazil and Sweden. It was not likely to be straightforward, with Brazil carrying the pressure of favouritism and a reputation for brutality. Before the match Sweden’s manager, Georg Ericson, described Brazil as “dirty”. “Thankfully,” he said, “we have got a strong referee in Clive Thomas, generally regarded as the best one here.”The first 90 minutes of the match have been forgotten. Thomas Sjöberg put Sweden ahead in the 37th minute, and Reinaldo equalised in first-half stoppage time. The score remained 1-1 as the match neared its conclusion. Brazil, pushing for victory, won a corner, and then another, and, in the dying seconds, a third. Nelinho, the right-back, prepared to take it. He was in no hurry. He placed the ball outside the arc, and the Polish linesman, Alojzy Jarguz, told him to move it. Thomas checked his watch. Six seconds of stoppage time had been played, and though the ball had not been in play for any of it, he thought it was almost over. Nelinho finally took the kick and, with the ball in the air, Thomas blew his whistle and turned for the tunnel. Behind him Zico headed the ball into the net. Brazil had scored their winner, a fraction of a second too late. “I find it unbelievable, incredible,” said their manager, Cláudio Coutinho. “The players are sad, depressed.” (Not as sad as they would be when eventually denied a place in the final after the hosts, needing to win by four goals, thumped Peru 6-0 in a game still seen as suspect.)In the run-up to the tournament the referees were sent a contract which stipulated they should not speak to the press. Thomas refused to sign it. “You know me,” he told the Mirror in May. “If I’ve got something to say I say it.” And so it was that, minutes after the final whistle in Mar del Plata, there were two British journalists in Thomas’s dressing room. They told him that rumours were circulating that he was to be sent home he gave them some quotes for the following day’s editions. “I saw the header, but I didn’t see the ball go into the net. I had turned away,” he said. “As far as I was concerned the game was over. The Brazilians have only themselves to blame. They should not have wasted so much time over taking the corner.”Thomas flew back to Buenos Aires, and went straight to bed. He was roused by the former Wales rugby union international Cliff Morgan, then head of sport at the BBC, who, in an unexpected turn of events, took him nightclubbing with David Coleman. He returned in the early hours and “slept the sleep of the just”, but was woken the following morning by Friedrich Seipelt, a member of Fifa’s referee’s committee, who told him he was going home. He would never again take charge of a World Cup match. The Welshman was predictably furious. It had been his dream to referee the final, which was eventually officiated by the Italian Sergio Gonella who, according to Thomas, “sounds like a danceband leader and, to my mind, referees like one”.Thomas continued to referee until 1984, maintaining to the end that his most infamous decision had been correct. “Zico was too late,” he insisted. “Possibly only four-tenths of a second too late, but too late nevertheless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e3f5d2de6ba6e8bc63cd4759017acc1e8839f/0_141_7468_4481/master/7468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0eb99c94ee118c4b543284810550d7","title":"lieke martens barcelona ronaldinho","story":"The Netherlands midfielder, the reigning Fifa and Uefa player of the year, on life at Barcelona and the pressures of being a role modelThe unusual girl playing football in the small Dutch town of Bergen in the late 90s does not know there is a women’s game. Instead her idol is Ronaldinho. Why? “Because I was a Barça fan,” says Lieke Martens. “He had long hair like me and great dribbles. I loved him. He was technical, made a lot of goals.”Watch the Netherlands and Barcelona midfielder, one can tell why she is a fan of the Brazilian great. Her Cruyff turn, back to goal, to take out two Belgium players, leaving one on the floor, as she drove forward at Euro 2017, is just a taste of her ability to trick and turn her way out of the tightest gaps with ease, à la Ronaldinho.The European Championship, hosted in her home country, catapulted Martens into the spotlight but in women’s football her talent was well known. With 20 goals in 29 games for Rosengard she could have had her pick of Europe’s top sides but, when the club of her childhood idol swooped, the decision was easy. “I played against Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Champions League with my previous club – the way they played I really liked it,” she says.With Barcelona’s investment in their women’s team a new development, the signing of Martens, English forward Toni Duggan, María Pilar León from Atlético Madrid and Élise Bussaglia from German champions Wolfsburg was a statement of intent. “I signed before the Euros,” Martens says. “For me it was really important to sign before, so I was clear in my head and free for the Euros.”Martens shone from the first whistle of the tournament and when her flighted pass from the corner of the box curved delightfully on to the head of Shanice van de Sanden to hand the Netherlands an opening victory over Norway, it was just the start.She was chosen in the team of the tournament, named player of the tournament and in the final she squeezed a shot between two Denmark players to give the Oranje Leeuwinnen (Orange Lionesses) a 2-1 lead after they had trailed to a sixth-minute Nadia Nadim penalty. “Playing a final is amazing,” she says. “There’s even more pressure but I really trusted the team.“When we went behind to the penalty I think we scored really quick, and then we got the lead, 2-1, then before half-time it was 2-2 and I remember at half-time we said to each other: ‘Come on girls, we really believe we’re going to do this’, and then we won 4-2. The trust in the team was so big during the tournament.”At no point did she believe they would fall short: “Even when we conceded one goal in the final, it was the first time we had gone behind, but I had no worries, nothing, that we would lose that game.”The Netherlands were outsiders, ranked 12th in the world. Germany, France and England were the favourites. So at what point did they realise they could win it? “We felt good after the group stage – we had nine points, we won all the games. Yeah, I really felt then that something was possible. When we beat England 3-0 in the semi-final I thought: ‘Right, now we have to win this final.’”The team were embraced by the country. The opening match in Utrecht was attended by 21,732 fans and, as momentum built, a sea of orange would flood the streets before games. “That was amazing, the whole tournament was amazing,” Martens says. “The first game was sold out and during the tournament we got more and more people really happy and wanting to see us play. In Utrecht the big celebration day was amazing. We really felt the support the whole tournament.”It has not stopped – 30,238 watched April’s 7-0 win over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier in Eindhoven. Martens, who has played for clubs in five different countries, won The Best Fifa Women’s Player award and Uefa Women’s Player of the Year award for 2017, and for the latter she flew to Monaco in a private plane with Lionel Messi before receiving the trophy alongside the men’s winner, Cristiano Ronaldo.Martens is focused on getting to France 2019 (the Netherlands are top of their qualifying group) and in the league on catching Atlético, who are one point ahead with five games to play. “We’re going to do everything to win – that’s all we can do. We are independent of them. I hope they are going to drop some points. It would be great to win the title in my first season in La Liga.”The girl who dreamed of being Ronaldinho is the poster girl for young female players in the Netherlands and elsewhere, and it is a role she does not take lightly. Martens will use any platform to show girls can play, and taking part in Uefa’s #PlayAnywhere competition (part of the @WePlayStrong campaign), which ends on 30 April, where girls post videos of themselves playing in unusual places, was a no-brainer. “When I was young,” she says, “I had no idea there were women players or what I could achieve and now we are role models. Of course I wanted to be involved.”• Jacqui Forster, founder of Women at the Game and former Supporters’ Direct worker, has died aged 55, nine years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

His large, wide-set eyes small, soft body and playful demeanor belie his maturity and emotional depth – attributes that become obvious once you get to know him. The truth is he’s about four, though the exact date of his birth, like that of many rescue dogs, is lost. He looks, to my eye, like some sort of a labrador-terrier mix, with a soulful amber gaze, spunky little foldy ears, and an itty-bitty little nosey. He is my friend and I love him.Until recently, though, his age and breed were up for debate. This was evidenced by an apparent dog expert at the local dog park on a recent morning. “No,” he said, shaking his head, after asking for the details of my dog. “My dog looked like that when she was a puppy, and now she looks like this.” He gestured to his large pit-bull-looking sweetie who, though beautiful, looked nothing like my little labrador-looking sweetie whom I love so much and for whom I would die. “Well … he’s about four,” I told him, hiding my annoyance well as I am extremely calm. “No. I don’t think so,” he said.The main reason I wanted to DNA test my dog was to shove the results in this rude man’s goddamn rude face, wherever he is. Probably hell!At-home dog DNA testing was made possible after the dog genome was sequenced in 2005 from the DNA of a female boxer named Tasha. Thank you, Tasha. This information provided a jumping-off point to map to the genomes of other dog breeds and their markers of genetic diseases, as well as some stuff about human diseases that frankly I do not think I should be the one to explain to you you may read about it here.“Of the more than 5,500 mammals living today, dogs are arguably the most remarkable,” said Eric Lander, senior author of the dog genome sequencing study and professor of biology at MIT. Agree. “The incredible physical and behavioral ersity of dogs – from chihuahuas to great danes – is encoded in their genomes. It can uniquely help us understand embryonic development, neurobiology, human disease, and the basis of evolution.” Wild stuff.For my at-home dog DNA test I picked Embark, which puts to use “over 20 times more genetic information than any other test on the market”, says Embark. The company uses more than 200,000 genetic markers to establish your dog’s breed, or breed mix, and more than 175 genetic health and trait tests to establish whether your dog is at risk for or a carrier of genetic disease. I chose Embark because I was not paying for it and it was the most expensive option ($189). Of the many tests currently on the market, Embark’s main competitor is Wisdom Panel 4.0 ($84.99), which only uses 2,000 genetic markers. Yeah, right. DNA My Dog ($68.98), the next-most-popular according to lists, doesn’t even give you a number of genetic markers it uses. Please.Embark’s kit comes with a swab. You hold the swab to the inside of your dog’s cheek for a few seconds, which they dislike very much, and then you put it into the sample tube, and then you send it back. They get the results to you in about two months, which is so long.May I tell you more about my dog? I’d like to, if you have a few hours. No? OK, I’ll make it slightly quicker. His name is Peter. Typically the more soft-hearted of humanity will, upon learning that his name is Peter, grasp their chest in delicious agony, as “Peter” is such a sweet name for such a gentle dog. Peter. The name came from Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, where I adopted him they give all of their dogs celebrity or otherwise famous names and his given name was “Peter Parker”. The “Peter” just seemed right. Peter.Before he was at Badass, he was a stray in south-east Georgia. The stray dog population is very large there, so Badass makes regular trips to bring back dogs to be adopted in New York. Peter was taken to a small kill shelter in a town called Mt Vernon, a place from which the Sweet Onion Animal Protection Society (Soaps) regularly tries to remove as many dogs as they can before the dogs are euthanized, to be placed into foster care and eventually adopted.While awaiting the results of Peter’s DNA test, I reached out to the Soaps director, Therisa Ingley, to see if the organization had any information about his pre-Brooklyn life. It had a little:“When Badass was visiting last February, we visited the shelter and they fell in love with Peter Parker. He had been picked up as a stray and had been there for awhile,” she said. “Very few dogs from shelters get adopted here because there are just so many. Badass fell in love with his gentle nature and he was pulled to go back with them.”He lived for about three years before I knew him. It really kills me that I was not able to protect him during that time, and that I’ll never really know what his life was like. However, I plan to teach him how to talk and I will update you once he tells me.Oh, you would like to know even more about Peter? If you insist. He has velvet ears. He has a spotted tongue. When he walks down the stairs, at his moderately paced gentleman’s trot, you can tell he’s a bit bow-legged. He has the heart of an angel and the soul of a poet, and there’s a hint of sadness to him that makes you want to protect him against all of the world’s harshness. He has whiskers that are so prominent they make you second-guess whether whiskers are a typical dog trait, or whether he could potentially be part mouse. He will sit his big, fat butt on your lap like he’s tiny, when he is actually 25 pounds. He’s affectionate, but not needy. “He’s just so ... kind,” is how a cousin of mine once described him, and it’s true: he’s just so kind. Also he loves to burrow under the covers, and he loves to sleep with his head on a pillow like a tiny little man.I wanted to know what he was because I want to know everything I can about him, and because I wanted to shove it in the face of any goddamn rude know-it-all men I came across in the future. But was there any other reason to get his DNA tested? I reached out to Ann Hohenhaus, staff doctor at New York City’s Animal Medical Center, to ask.“Well, I think that it depends,” she said. “You can use DNA testing for a lot of things. One thing is for fun.” (Meaning to find out what kind of a little sweetie my dog is.) “The second is that we’ve been using DNA tests in dogs for a long time to diagnose specific diseases … With a particular breed and a particular set of clinical signs, a DNA test may be a very efficient way to make a diagnosis in a patient.”While I was impatiently awaiting the results of my DNA test, this haunted me. What if the DNA test told me Peter was sick? He didn’t seem sick. But what if maybe he was going to be sick in the future? I also worried about how I would write around it in this piece. Maybe I would attempt to feature it as a poignant look at the impermanence of life, but, in contrast, the permanence of love – how his love will always be with me, and mine with him, no matter what. Luckily I do not have to travel down this thought-provoking road, because after six agonizing weeks of waiting, I received Peter’s impressive results:Peter tested clear for the 165 genetic conditions for which Embark scans, including 28 that are common in his breed mix, like congenital hypothyroidism, progressive retinal atrophy, and muscular dystrophy. Huh. “Not even at risk for any of them?” I wondered. “Did I do it wrong?” I wondered. “Is this wrong?” I asked Dr Hohenhaus.“I’m not surprised your dog was negative for those diseases, because those genetic diseases don’t occur very often in mixed-breed dogs,” she said. Oh. “That’s not to say they never do – I’ve diagnosed genetic disease in a mixed-breed dog. The disease normally occurred in the springer iel and this dog was a black-and-white shorthaired thing, and it had the same genetic mutation. But that’s the only time I’ve ever done that. So, it occurs but it’s rare.”Still, she said, there could be danger in taking negative results of the at-home swab test as gospel. The tests typically look for a single mutation, and if your dog’s disease (say pyruvate kinase deficiency, which has several mutations across different breeds) has a mutation that hasn’t been discovered yet – even if he presents symptoms that would be obvious to a veterinarian – the test won’t catch it. Plus, a cheek swab test means a bacteria-laden sample: “When I do DNA testing, I take a blood sample and send it in. And a blood sample is inherently ‘cleaner’, in quotes, than if you do a home DNA test with a cheek swab,” Honenhaus told me. “So that test has some inherent issues, because you have the DNA of the bacteria in the dog’s mouth along with the dog’s DNA, in that sample. And so I think that there is probably an opportunity for a sample that’s harder to read if there’s a lot of bacteria in the mouth. So, DNA testing labs, I’m certain, would prefer to have a blood sample. I think really the at-home DNA testing is not as much for disease as it is for the fun.”Yes, this checks out. Mostly what you’re looking for when you’re giving your dog a DNA test you ordered from the internet, I believe, is the fun of finding out the fun little mystery of who he is. Speaking of the fun little mystery of who he is, do you want to know what my dog is? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you ready? Here, look at this photo of him so you can guess before you know:Do you have your guess? OK. Here it is:He is, as you can see, so many things. Peter. (A “supermutt” means, according to Embark, that there may be “small amounts of DNA from these distant ancestors”: chow chow, dalmatian, and miniature pinscher.) Here he is. The basic structure of a labrador retriever. The smaller stature of a chihuahua. The intelligent, calm demeanor of a golden retriever. The love for burrowing of the small-prey hunter dachshund. The wide-set eyes and expressive ears of a rat terrier. The sociability of the miniature schnauzer. The wide chest and slightly bowed back legs of the American staffordshire terrier. The spotted tongue of the chow chow.He is, according to the test, about 36 in people years – roughly four years old.I asked Dr Hohenhaus if there was anything practical to be gleaned from learning the breeds that go into a mutt, and she wasn’t sure the evidence was out there – yet. “I think that two years from now you’ll write a different article than you’ll write today. Because this is an area of expansion and growth, and we’ll know better how to use the fact that your dog, although he only weighs 25lb, is part labrador, we’ll know better how to use that information,” she said.I look forward to this day. But for now, at least I know how I’ll use this information: against rude men who think they know more about my dog than I do at the dog park.Looking for more great work from the Outline, an online publication focused on power, culture, and the future?

And not just the taste, but the memories attached to it: where, when, with whom. I am far from alone in this. With this article in mind, I asked friends and colleagues about soup and received similar potted histories full of life, and often quite touching detail about the making and eating of soup.Soup also makes me think of Mona Talbott, who used to be the chef at the American Academy in Rome. Every Sunday for seven months, while Mona cooked soup, I sat on a stool in the academy kitchen documenting the details and measurements for what would become a soup book. At the end of each session, I walked back down the Gianicolo hill, taking in the expansive view of the city, with the day’s work sloshing in clinking jars, which we then ate over the following few days. I was pregnant at the time, with a furious appetite, which is the reason my son was known as a soup baby, his size put down to my considerable consumption. Apart from the eating (and learning to write a decent recipe), what I enjoyed most about that time was watching how the soups evolved with the seasons, from sturdy to brothy, to bright red with fresh tomatoes – a change somehow more apparent than in my own kitchen because it was just once a week – like watching other people’s kids grow up, maybe.Until a couple of weeks ago, I was still making beefy and thick bean soups, throwing handfuls of dried broad beans in root vegetable minestrone – which has a sort of hummus effect – and getting kale stuck in my teeth. Now the soups we want look a bit like April itself: brothy and green with a spring in their step. Mona’s spring soups were some of my favourites, so it is her hands, ways and tips I recall: starting slowly with the onion, adding tiny pinches of salt as you go, trusting that water, rather than stock, is enough keeping things simple, knowing you can embellish later with croutons, chilli, herbs, dumplings, cheese.Peel and slice a large onion, then cook it slowly in a knob of butter, a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and small pinch of salt until soft, then add a thinly sliced garlic clove and stir for another minute or so. It will smell good. Meanwhile, peel and dice a large potato (about 350g) and add it to the pan with another small pinch of salt, stir, then pour over enough water to cover everything by a good couple of inches. If you have one, throw in a parmesan rind. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes, adding a few handfuls of fresh or thawed frozen peas, and any chopped herbs or tender spring greens you fancy, for the last five minutes. By the end of cooking, the potatoes should be very tender. If you like, blend half the soup for a creamier texture. Taste and season with a few grinds of pepper and a heaped tablespoon of grated parmesan. Serve just so, over toasted bread or with croutons, possibly more parmesan and a zig-zag of olive oil on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7caeae62ea15df39e04439eb792727847a70992e/254_354_2746_1648/master/2746.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb9f942c9b8a3361a27ba208c28244d","title":"natalie prass review bush hall london","story":"Bush Hall, LondonThe Virginia songwriter has added funk and soul to her swooning ballads and 60s pop, fired up by ‘all the crap that’s going on in our country right now’‘My whole life I’ve been compared to Karen Carpenter, pretty much on looks alone,” says Natalie Prass, whose thick, dark fringe and fresh face do impart a passing resemblance to the late singer. “When I found out who she was, I became obsessed.” The extent of her obsession is made plain in the new song that follows, Far from You, a lovelorn response to the Carpenters’ Close to You.

At one point, they worked with the animator Aardman to create a\u0026nbspfree iPhone game called Music Inc, where you attempt to manage a\u0026nbspband, but always fail because of online\u0026nbsppiracy.For decades, a\u0026nbspjob in music had been some of the most fun you could have as an adult. Labels were charging up to £20 for a CD, raking in hundreds of millions of pounds. And they typically received the lion’s share. When Guy Hands, a private equity manager, arrived at EMI in 2007, he wondered why hundreds of thousands of pounds were being spent on floral arrangements until he realised that “fruit and flowers” was accounting slang for drugs, sex workers and other items otherwise difficult to put on an expenses claim. Parties, hedonism and drug use were part of the job.Then, in the space of a\u0026nbspdecade, the music industry essentially collapsed\u0026nbsp– in the US, music’s biggest market, annual revenues fell from $14.6bn in 1999 to $6.3bn in 2009. Some artists still did OK, particularly those who focused on live shows, merchandise and brand endorsements, but labels had to dramatically cut costs. At EMI, Hands did away with the slush fund as well as almost half the workforce. At the label Per Sundin ran, the majority of the team was laid off. The expense accounts, the marketing budgets, the joy of taking a\u0026nbsppunt on a\u0026nbspweird band of misfits in the hope something magical might happen\u0026nbsp– it was all over. Chart music became safer the bestselling records of the 2010s have all been by middle-of-the-road acts with lots of “nan appeal”: Adele, Ed Sheeran, Michael Bublé and Take\u0026nbspThat.So does that mean we’re back to the glory days of Britpop, private jets and swimming pools full of cocaine? It doesn’t seem that way. There is money sloshing around, but it is not ending up in the places you might expect. Certain genres of music and types of artist are experiencing a\u0026nbspboom, while others remain destitute. It’s a\u0026nbspworld where Nordic cloud-rappers and South American reggaeton artists are watching their bank balances grow, whereas young, hyped guitar bands are struggling.The balance of power has shifted in all kinds of unexpected ways. What has happened, in the space of a\u0026nbspcouple of years, is the biggest change to the industry since the launch of\u0026nbspNapster. Where is all the money ending up? “Five years ago, the kinds of artists we work with wouldn’t see a\u0026nbsppenny until their album came out\u0026nbsp– and even then the album would have to do really well to make any money back,” says Sahil Varma, who works in A\u0026ampR for a mid-sized London based independent label, 37 Adventures. “Now, you’re making money from day\u0026nbspone.”He gives the example of Jones, a soulful singer-songwriter signed to the label. She is not a big artist she plays mid-sized venues in London and her debut album failed to make the Top 200. But on Spotify she has been streamed more than 70m times. “That equates to revenue of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Five years ago, with such low sales, she would have been dropped the week after her album came out. Brands have started looking at Spotify plays, too, so she is doing some stuff with Barbour. Now she has a\u0026nbspsteady income.” Varma says there are thousands of artist like Jones, who just a\u0026nbspfew years ago would have had to get other\u0026nbspjobs.This was always the promise of the streaming revolution. When Spotify launched in 2008, it pledged to defeat music piracy and ensure that artists got paid for their music\u0026nbsp– but it quickly emerged that what they were willing to pay artists was a\u0026nbspcouple of thousandths of a\u0026nbsppenny for each stream. There is a\u0026nbspbig debate over exactly how many thousandths\u0026nbsp– the latest survey by Digital Music News suggests that Apple Music pays $0.00783 and Spotify pays $0.00397. However, Rolling Stone has reported that artists and labels with greater clout in the industry are getting better rates. When I\u0026nbspask Tim Dellow, at the indie label Transgressive (home to Foals and Flume), he says that they are “on a\u0026nbsppar” with the majors. What remains true is that the biggest artists will have more favourable deals with their labels, allowing them to see a\u0026nbspbigger percentage of royalties, just as in the CD\u0026nbspera.Whatever the specifics, we are talking about tiny amounts of money, especially compared with CD sales. Initially, artists revolted, with, for example, Thom Yorke removing his solo album The Eraser from Spotify in 2013, after its producer, Nigel Godrich, complained the service favoured established acts and didn’t support new artists. Some of the biggest artists in the world\u0026nbsp– Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyoncé\u0026nbsp– followed suit, withholding their releases from streaming platforms either temporarily or indefinitely. Smaller artists signed to big labels were essentially powerless to choose whether their music went on to the service or not, and complained that labels were raking in big profits from Spotify while artists were seeing\u0026nbspscraps.But, over time, it has become clear that the fraction of a\u0026nbsppenny you receive from a\u0026nbspstream can’t be seen in the same context as the royalty on a CD sale. The money an artist made from a\u0026nbspphysical album was a\u0026nbspone-off payment within weeks of it being released, this revenue frequently dried\u0026nbspup.On Spotify, every time a listener wants to play the song, the artist gets a\u0026nbsptiny bit of money. If a\u0026nbsplistener adds the song to one of their own playlists, that can mean it will be repeatedly revisited over a\u0026nbsplifetime. If it gets added to one of Spotify’s curated mood playlists, Acoustic Spring, for example, the artist can expect tens of millions of plays. Acts whose biggest hits came well before the streaming era are banking huge new revenues from their existing catalogue. Fleetwood Mac have 11\u0026nbspmillion monthly listeners that’s more than Stormzy, George Ezra or Harry Styles. They will collect a\u0026nbsphuge cheque every month without doing\u0026nbspanything.There are ways to exploit the system, too. “Almost every track we release, we then release in an acoustic version a\u0026nbspfew weeks later,” says Varma. “The acoustic version will end up on different playlists to the main version\u0026nbsp– ones such as Sunday Chilled, and often it will get more\u0026nbspstreams.”Some bigger artists have taken this “moneyball” approach to extremes. Not content with the 1.7bn streams his song Shape of You has had on the site, Ed Sheeran released an acoustic version (74m streams), a\u0026nbspreggaeton version for the Latin market (69m), a\u0026nbspversion with a Stormzy verse (50m), a Major Lazer version for dancehall playlists (48m) and three further dance remixes (32m streams).When just the remixes of one Sheeran song get more streams than some artists will have in their entire career, you can see why big labels are excited. Analysts say the biggest artists, such as Sheeran and Drake, have received in excess of $50m from Spotify before other streaming services are factored in. Sheeran’s label, Warner music, took $1.3bn from streaming alone last\u0026nbspyear.“Our catalogue has become so much more valuable,” says Alec Boateng, the co-head of A\u0026ampR at Atlantic Records. “That means we’ve got more money swirling around the whole company, allowing us to invest pretty heavily in A\u0026ampR and\u0026nbspdevelopment. We’re patient with artists – and being patient can be expensive. The new income makes us feel a\u0026nbspbit more comfortable spending time working with an artist to develop\u0026nbspthem.”The way that A\u0026ampRs are finding new artists is changing, too. Today, every major label has at least one analytics expert, whose job it is to follow trends on the streaming platforms and flag up any unsigned artists who are performing well. It means that a\u0026nbspkid from nowhere who uploads a\u0026nbspsong to Spotify that does well can find every label in the world descending on them, trying to sign a\u0026nbspdeal.“If you walked into any major label meeting this week, the thing they’d be talking about is how ‘Spotify-friendly’ an artist is,” says Varma. “By that, they mean: can they get on Spotify’s playlists, such as New Pop Revolution or Chilled Pop?” Artists such as Nils Frahm, a\u0026nbsprelatively obscure German composer, gets more than 2.5m monthly streams from appearing on playlists such as Peaceful Piano and Songs for\u0026nbspSleeping.Music used to be dominated by audiences with the most spending power\u0026nbsp– so middle-class, middle-aged people, buying albums at Tesco as part of their weekly shop, often decided what topped the charts. Now, Afrobeat, Danish rap, hundreds of genres of niche electronic music and particularly British urban music are flourishing commercially, without having to make any concessions to the\u0026nbspmainstream.“Before, you had to get on mainstream radio, have a\u0026nbspcertain style or sound,” says Boateng. “It’s allowing for a\u0026nbspmore erse proposition for British music and a\u0026nbspwider range of people who are stars. A\u0026nbspgeneration are coming through and feeling\u0026nbspfree.”Even artists who had been written off by the industry are finding an afterlife on streaming. After her much-hyped debut, the BBC Sound of 2010 winner, Little Boots, failed to make the Top 40 with her second record and was dropped by her label. Now she releases her own music to a\u0026nbspsmall but committed\u0026nbspfanbase.“Before, I\u0026nbspmight have sold a\u0026nbspton of records, but none of that money went to me after I\u0026nbspgot my advance and I\u0026nbsphad very little say in how the money was spent,” she says on the phone from Los Angeles, where she now lives. “Now, when I\u0026nbsprelease something, I\u0026nbsphave to pay a\u0026nbsppercentage to my distributor, but most of it ends up with me. It’s not a\u0026nbsphuge amount, and I\u0026nbspthink it should be higher, but I\u0026nbsphave control and I\u0026nbsphave transparency. If I\u0026nbspknow I’m going to get 5,000 streams of a\u0026nbsptrack I\u0026nbspcan do the maths and say: that’s this amount of money, so I\u0026nbspcan spend this amount of money on a\u0026nbspnew EP and project how much I’ll make back. I’m like a\u0026nbspboutique business.”Indeed, streaming has allowed artists such as Chance the Rapper, Skepta, Stormzy and Novelist to release music without signing to a\u0026nbsptraditional label, with hundreds of smaller artists successfully following a\u0026nbspsimilar path. Are labels not worried that streaming, while providing a\u0026nbspshort-term bump, will make them\u0026nbspobsolete?“It’s definitely a\u0026nbspchallenge for labels to persuade artists that signing a\u0026nbsprecord deal will be useful to their careers, but I\u0026nbspthink that’s a\u0026nbspgood thing,” says Boateng. “It makes us clear about what we’re trying to achieve. Because artists can see that they’ll earn a\u0026nbspcertain amount of money without any involvement from a\u0026nbsplabel, I\u0026nbspmake an understanding with an artist about what I’m offering. Helping them make the best music they can make, challenging them, introducing new creative relationships\u0026nbsp– that’s where the value lies. Sometimes you’ll get an artist who isn’t interested and they might walk away, but then others, who ambition-wise are thinking a\u0026nbspbit more globally, they can see what we bring to the\u0026nbsptable.”I wonder if this all sounds too good to be true\u0026nbsp– can streaming really be making things better for small artists, big artists and labels? Boateng says there aren’t really any losers, but some music managers and label staff I\u0026nbspspeak to say that if you don’t fit neatly into Spotify playlists, it can be a\u0026nbsplot harder to make an impact. This is particularly true if you’re an unusual indie band whose record someone might once have bought as a\u0026nbspstatus symbol, but not listened to that often. Spotify’s hip-hop playlist Rap Caviar, described by Vulture as “the most influential playlist in music”, has 9.3 million subscribers. The service’s Punked playlist, described as “vital, angry new music from the bleeding edge of modern punk”, has fewer than 5,000.There are lots of small ways Spotify has changed the way music is made. The intros of songs have become shorter to stop listeners skipping a\u0026nbsptrack with a\u0026nbspslow buildup. Albums have got longer, often clocking in at more than 20 tracks, simply because listening to a 20-track album generates twice as much revenue as listening to a 10-track one. Acts with global appeal obviously perform much better than those who are only popular in one country, which means region-specific sounds can lose out. The creation of so many activity-based playlists (music for running, music for relaxing) has also proven challenging for artists who make abrasive music. “It’s undoubtedly easier to programme ‘mood-based’ tunes than music that’s unignorable, interruptive and commands your full attention rather than passively soundtracking another activity,” says\u0026nbspDellow.In practice, this has meant that electronic and urban artists are performing better than they would without streaming whereas local alternative acts are struggling. A\u0026nbspband such as Pale Waves, fifth on the BBC Sound of 2018 tastemakers poll with lots of radio play and written about extensively in the music press, have 428,000 monthly listeners. 6ix9ine, a Brooklyn “SoundCloud rapper” who is barely played on UK radio, has 6.1\u0026nbspmillion.For Dellow, whose label signs mostly alternative acts, this just means they can’t give up on other revenue streams, including physical sales. “In a\u0026nbspsense, we have two markets: those who were previously just listening to music on the radio and not going to shows or buying albums – and that’s great, and they’re easier to reach now – but also a\u0026nbspmarket of diehard obsessives who I’d love to see still supporting an artist with a\u0026nbsppurchase if they’ve been repeatedly streaming and enjoying a\u0026nbsprelease.”Few insiders would air their concerns about Spotify on the record, citing the sensitivity of the relationship. The shadowy decision-making process by Spotify playlist compilers is a\u0026nbspconcern, with so much power concentrated in the hands a\u0026nbspfew, often unidentified, people. Spotify, which has 3,000 employees, refused repeated requests for an interview. (“No one from the team is available,” its publicist\u0026nbspsaid.)Varma strikes another note of caution: although previously artists weren’t making much money from record sales, they were able to develop a\u0026nbspfinancial connection with their fans through touring or merchandise. Now that’s being lost. “Streaming often has no bearing on whether people want to buy tickets or a\u0026nbspphysical album,” says Varma. “The audience is pretty passive for most huge streaming acts. For Jones, we found out that many people streaming her didn’t even know who she was they were streaming her on a\u0026nbspplaylist alongside 50 other\u0026nbspsongs.”Still, even the insiders I\u0026nbspspeak to who do express concerns say that the overall the benefits of streaming outweigh the negatives. There is a\u0026nbspsense that streaming has created a\u0026nbspmore democratic music industry one in which artists can make money with or without a\u0026nbsplabel, and where the spending power of a\u0026nbspgenre’s audience doesn’t affect how much money can be\u0026nbspmade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a7e76a0d35c8fc00f68818914b2e68bdd6d6f2/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c651666e3f6dbe7b0f07170c0c94519","title":"aleksandr kogan cambridge analytica facebook data business ventures","story":"The story of Aleksandr Kogan’s business ventures reveals a world where companies traded in the currency of personal information As Aleksandr Kogan goes before parliament on Tuesday to account for his role in the controversial harvesting of Facebook data that was later used by Cambridge Analytica, he leaves behind him two unsuccessful companies and a once-promising academic career.Kogan was a young psychologist fresh off a post-doctoral fellowship when he earned an appointment as a lecturer at Cambridge University in 2012 – a coup for any academic. Just six years later, the erstwhile Dr Spectre has been maligned in the press, mocked for his eccentric name change, and banned from the social network that he thought would provide him with the data to advance his research. He has also brought unwelcome scrutiny of Cambridge University’s other researchers, prompting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to tell the US Congress that the company is looking into “whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall”. In a recent interview with 60 Minutes, Kogan apologised for his role in the controversy, saying: “I think that the core idea we had – that everybody knows, and nobody cares – was wrong. For that, I am sincerely sorry.”The story of Kogan’s commercial ventures reveals a world where companies traded in the currency of personal data. As Kogan declined to speak on the record with the  for this article, this account is based on public records, interviews with Kogan’s associates, and emails seen by the .It was at Cambridge, home of the renowned Psychometrics Centre, that Kogan became the crucial link between SCL Elections (an entity related to Cambridge Analytica) and Facebook’s vast troves of personal data. Two other Cambridge researchers, Dr Michal Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell, had pioneered the use of Facebook data for psychometric research with a Facebook quiz application, the myPersonality quiz, which launched in 2007. Kogan built his own personality quiz application in 2013, and used it for academic research, according to an email he sent to Cambridge colleagues in March.Kogan was introduced to SCL Elections in January 2014 by a Cambridge psychology PhD student, according to emails seen by the .SCL offered Kogan the holy grail for a social scientist: money to pay people to take his surveys. And Kogan had something SCL wanted: a Facebook application that worked under the social network’s pre-2014 terms of service, which allowed app developers to harvest data not only from the people who installed the app, but from their friends. “New applications are not able to access friend networks and no other psychometric profiling applications exist under the old Facebook terms,” the contract that SCL and Kogan’s company ultimately signed reads. Between that first meeting and 4 June 2014, when the contract was signed, Kogan tried to recruit Stillwell and Kosinski to work on the SCL project with him. The negotiations broke down, and John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, accused Kogan of using Kosinski’s and Stillwell’s ideas for a “get rich quick” scheme. Kogan denied the charges, defending his work as original and accusing Rust in turn of “bullying”.Speaking to the  on a previous occasion, Kogan said: “When we initially envisioned doing the project with SCL, we had planned for it to be collaboration with Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell at the Psychometrics Centre. “Even though I very much wanted to work with Michal and David, SCL felt that their position of a fee of $500,000 for the modelling portion of the project was not warranted. And so SCL asked me to remove Michal and David from the project.“John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, then made a complaint to the university on behalf of Michal and David … and even though the university’s investigation resulted in no support for John’s claims, I still lost valuable collaborators that I enjoyed working with.“In the end, I believe the Psychometrics Centre wanted to get back on the project, even though SCL had moved on based on their negative experience with them.”At the end of May 2014, Kogan established the company, Global Science Research Ltd (GSR) that signed the contract with SCL Elections. Kogan’s co-director of GSR, and a witness to the contract’s execution, was Joseph Chancellor, a post-doctoral student in Kogan’s lab who is currently employed by Facebook. Kogan described Chancellor as an equal partner in the enterprise to 60 Minutes, saying: “We did everything together”. A spokesman for Facebook defended the company’s disparate treatment of the business partners, saying of Chancellor: “His work at Facebook is unrelated to what he did previously.”Despite Rust’s accusations, the contract did not offer any financial remuneration to Kogan and Chancellor. Instead, they would be rewarded with data – both the Facebook data and an additional dataset of 1 million citizens of Trinidad and Tobago – which they would go on to attempt to spin into both academic and commercial gold.  understands that Kogan never received the Trinidad and Tobago dataset.In August 2014, GSR added another director, who described himself as the chief financial officer and co-founder of GSR on his LinkedIn profile in December 2014.“The company owns a massive data pool of 40+ million iniduals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles,” the LinkedIn profile stated at the time. The profile described two products being offered by GSR: Peek, a tool to help businesses understand the “psychological, economic, ethnographic knowledge” profiles of their customer bases, and SurveyExtender, a tool to forecast survey results. When the  contacted Kogan in December 2014, he affirmed by email that GSR was developing the two products, which he compared, respectively, to CubeYou and SurveyMonkey. (Facebook suspended CubeYou from its platform in April 2018, following inquiries about data usage from CNBC).It would be another year before the  published an article revealing that Cambridge Analytica was using the Facebook data to target voters for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. In the meantime, Kogan continued to work with the Facebook data, both for academic research and for GSR, which had a website promoting its tools to “optimise marketing strategies with the power of big data and psychological sciences”. He maintained a close relationship with Facebook, which provided him with an anonymised, aggregate dataset of 57 billion Facebook friendships for research purposes. He told 60 Minutes: “I even did a consulting project with Facebook in November of 2015, and what I was teaching them was lessons I learned from working with this dataset that we had collected for Cambridge Analytica, so I was explaining, ‘Here’s kinda what we did, and here’s what we learned, and here’s how you could apply it internally to help you with surveys and survey predictions and things like that.’”In June 2015, Kogan also established a Delaware corporation, Philometrics, which remains active and of which he is CEO. Chancellor resigned as a director of GSR in September 2015 and was hired by Facebook a few months later. According to public documents, however, he remained a partial owner of the company through May 2016. After the ’s publication of the December 2015 exposé, Facebook contacted Kogan and required him to delete the GSR data. The company also ceased collaborating with Kogan on research related to the 57 billion friendship data set. The end result was a major setback for Kogan and especially his graduate students, who had to abandon about 18 months of work.In March 2016, Kogan wrote to Rust and Stillwell of the Psychometrics Centre to request access to the myPersonality dataset for one of his PhD students, who had been using the GSR dataset for his dissertation, according to emails seen by the . Rust rejected Kogan’s appeal, writing: “I think it completely inappropriate that we should have anything more to do with you or your companies.”With Kogan’s academic career sputtering, he appears to have turned his attention to building SurveyExtender into a viable product, now under the auspices of Philometrics.  understands that the version of SurveyExtender marketed by Philometrics did not use the GSR Facebook data. Kogan moved to San Francisco, though he has maintained his position at Cambridge in order to supervise his remaining PhD students. His company attracted the attention of at least one investor, the media monitoring firm Meltwater. In his 2017 book Outside Insight, Meltwater’s founder Jørn Lyseggen interviewed Kogan, who was using his married name, Alex Spectre, at the time. Lyseggen describes Philometrics as a “pioneer” in the realm of garnering consumer insights and competitive intelligence from social media data.In October 2017, GSR was dissolved. That same month, Kogan registered a UK business, Philometrics Ltd, of which Kogan was CEO and the US Philometrics was the sole shareholder. Kogan and at least one of his employees worked out of Meltwater’s San Francisco office for a time. A spokeswoman for Meltwater confirmed that the company is a minority investor in Philometrics and that a Philometrics employees “contributed time on an internal Meltwater pilot project attempting to predict future values of cryptocurrencies”.The company appears to have soured on Kogan, however. “Meltwater invested in Philometrics because of Alex Spectre’s impressive background as a professor from Cambridge University and the prospect of him recruiting valuable talents he knew from Cambridge,” a spokeswoman told the  by email. “There were no Facebook data in the company Meltwater invested in.”She continued: “Alex never succeeded in building Philometrics into a successful company. As far as we understand Philometrics is today a company with very limited operations and employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a2e9fe5018d76cc5bc186f5cc2872d7070f8872/0_63_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00038d3a968f8d175853dd67eee57b31","title":"labour government would hold amritsar raid inquiry corbyn vows","story":"Labour leader promises independent inquiry into Britain’s alleged role in Indian army’s 1984 raid on Golden TempleAn independent inquiry into Britain’s military role in the Indian army’s 1984 raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar will be launched under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn has said.The Labour leader promised that an investigation into the attack, which is said to have left thousands of people dead, would be in the party’s next manifesto.Sikh groups have repeatedly called for a fresh inquiry into an apparent decision by Margaret Thatcher’s government to send an SAS officer to Delhi to advise the Indians on the operation.David Cameron ordered his most senior civil servant to investigate alleged British involvement in 2014. He found that the advice was ignored by the Indian army, which launched a full-scale ground assault, causing a heavy loss of life.The finding was met with “disappointment” by British Sikh groups, and the Sikh Federation said Sir Jeremy Heywood’s review had been “limited in scope”.Corbyn, speaking at a Sikh Federation event in Watford, said: “You can be very sure that, whenever the election comes, it will be in the next manifesto ... it’s a commitment that’s going to be there and we will honour that commitment.” It came as Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Ooffice’s most senior civil servant, apologised after describing the Golden Temple, one of the most revered in the Sikh religion, as a mosque on Twitter.After realising the error, the permanent secretary said: “I was wrong: I am sorry. I should of course have said the Golden Temple or, better, Sri Harmandir Sahib.” However, Bhai Amrik Singh, the chairman of the Sikh Federation, said: “This was a major gaffe by a top civil servant and totally unacceptable. It demonstrates a remarkable level of ignorance from someone in his position.” He added: “In our view, a public apology and admitting the mistake is not enough. What we need is a commitment from the UK government and senior civil servants to root out such ignorance and discrimination or we will continue to face hate, abuse and threats of violence.” The error is particularly sensitive given the suspicions that exist around the extent of UK involvement in the 1984 raid. The temple had been occupied by militants under the command of a seminary student turned extremist, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who called for an independent homeland for the Sikh minority of predominantly Hindu India.Many hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed in the assault. They included Bhindranwale himself as well as Sikh and Hindu pilgrims caught in the crossfire. The temple was badly damaged.The botched operation, in which 136 Indian soldiers also died, led to the assassination of the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, by her Sikh bodyguards, which in turn provoked massacres of Sikhs. About 3,000 were stabbed, burned or beaten to death by mobs in Delhi, the capital, alone.Gandhi’s Operation Blue Star horrified moderate Sikhs and in its aftermath, Punjab, the north-western state that is their historic homeland, was plunged into a violent insurgency that lasted almost a decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef5dd5c69a27c6ae8b8949aac4e9f0dc7010a51/128_0_1512_907/master/1512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49f9f29f27afa25e1c5b9c55fc5fd0c3","title":"cambridge analytica kogan barnier says eu needs more clarity from uk over its brexit demands politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenQ: How did the company come to workers in the Nigerian elections?Mitchell says the questioner (my colleague Carole Cadwalladr) is stating as fact things that are assertions.

He goes on:Cambridge Analytica is no Bond villain.But he accepts that the company has made mistakes. The company is investigating what went wrong.And he says it has set up a website, cambridgefacts, to tell its side of the story.Business secretary Greg Clark has waved through the sale of one Britain’s oldest engineering firms to a controversial investment group. As the Press Association reports, Clark dismissed claims of a “predatory” takeover as he confirmed the sale of GKN to Melrose Industries in the Commons. Labour had called for the sale to be blocked on national security grounds, as the company provides many Ministry of Defence contracts, but this was rejected. Explaining the decision Mr Clark told MPs of the numerous assurances given by Melrose as part of the 8.1 billion takeover deal. He said:The MoD has completed its detailed analysis and has agreed with Melrose a series of undertakings specifically to ensure that the government is informed in advance of any plans to est a business, a component of the business or assets which engage in activities that the Ministry of Defence considers to have national security implications. And here is the story on the hearing from my colleagues Alex Hern and Jim Waterson.Here are the main points from the evidence given by Aleksandr Kogan to the Commons culture committee as part of its fake news inquiry. Kogan is the Cambridge academic who ran a company collecting Facebook data for the political consultancy SCL, which is linked to Cambridge Analytica.In my view Facebook’s comments are PR crisis mode. I don’t believe they actually think these things because I think they realise that their platform has been mined left and right by thousands of others and I was just the unlucky person that ended up somehow linked to the Trump campaign and we are where we are. I think they realise all this. But PR is PR and they were trying to manage the crisis and it’s convenient to point the finger at a single entity and point the finger that this is a rogue agent. The idea that this data is accurate, I would say, is scientifically ridiculous. The idea that you even if you had a lot more data you could make it super-accurate is also pretty silly.If you wanted to say, ‘I want to target people with ads related to personality, I want to target real extrovert people’, all you do is go recruit 10,000 people, you don’t collect any Facebook data at all, you ask them for their email addresses and you ask them to fill out a personality survey. Then you say what are the 2,000 that are the most extrovert. Then you take their email addresses and you go on the Facebook ad platform and you say, ‘Facebook, please build me a lookalike audience.’ And what they are going to do is take those 2,000 email addresses and find the people on Facebook that match those 2,000 email addresses. And they’re then going to use all the data they’ve got to figure out who are all the people like this. This way you will find everybody who’s an extrovert, potentially, based on their predictions. By March 2015 we had begun to suspect that Mr Wylie might not be the most reputable person in the world and that we should question some of the advice he gave. We reached that conclusion because it was clear that he was duplicitous in his arrangement with us. He said that he has reached an agreement with Wylie’s company about sharing data, but Wylie did not honour the agreement.There’s a long history of the United States interfering in foreign elections ... In general I would say that the governments that are most high-profile, I’m dubious about the moral scruples of their activities. He made it clear that the UK, the US and Russia were among the countries he was referring to at this point.We are working on questions like, are people who are kinder happier? And we found it really depends. In states like New York kinder people are less happier than average. In states like Utah, people who are kinder tend to be happier.Here is Ryan Mac, BuzzFeed’s tech reporter, with an assessment of Aleksandr Kogan’s evidence to the culture committee.Summary of key points coming up soon.Nicola Sturgeon has written to Theresa May today to say the Scottish government will not support a compromise deal on sharing post-Brexit powers with the UK government, after she apparently vetoed a new offer over the weekend.UK and Welsh government officials were preparing for a joint ministerial meeting involving Scottish ministers in London today where they hoped all three governments would sign an agreement for UK-wide common frameworks on sharing 24 EU powers after Brexit.UK ministers have until tomorrow to table an amendment to clause 11 of the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords, before a Lords debate on 2 May, which includes a series of significant concessions by May’s government.Clause 11 sets out the three administrations, and the Northern Irish government, would control or share 153 EU powers over areas such as farming, fisheries, food labelling and state aid. Under the current proposal, only 24 of those powers would be shared at UK level, with 12 reserved to Whitehall. Sturgeon’s officials said that Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, would make a detailed statement at Holyrood at about 2.20pm on Wednesday to explain why the latest compromise had been rejected. UK officials believe Russell was ready to sign the agreement, only to be overruled by Sturgeon over the weekend. Speaking after the Scottish cabinet were told the deal was being rejected, Sturgeon’s spokesman said: “I don’t recognise that description. We are continuing to engage seriously to talk seriously” about a deal.That’s it. The hearing is now over.I will post a summary soon.Q: Who funded the work in St Petersburg?Kogan says it was the Russian government.Kogan asks why that is relevant. Damian Collins asks whether the Russians wanted to stop cyberbullying, or to get better at it.Kogan says there is a long history of the American government interfering in foreign elections.He says he is dubious about the moral activities of powerful governments.But he is not equating the US and Russia, he says.But if people are suggesting that the Russians were funding academic research for political motives, you would have to ask if the UK was doing the same, he suggests.(Then, annoyingly, the audio feed from the committee goes down.)Q: Was your non-disclosure agreement signed before or after the data breach?Kogan says he cannot answer that.Kogan says he comes from Moldova. But he moved to the US when he was seven.

This month, three would-be MPs from across the political spectrum – each of them with a disability – launched a legal challenge against the government to force it to reinstate the access to elected office fund, the £2.6m pot of money intended to help disabled candidates campaign on an equal footing to any non-disabled rival.To really understand why this matters, we need to go back to 2012 when the fund was launched. For three years, disabled candidates were offered grants of between £250 and £40,000 to help meet any potential additional costs incurred in standing for election as a local councillor or MP. The money could be used for anything from assistive technology for blind people, to a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter, or a mobility car.But in 2015, the government froze the fund. This happened just as ministers brought in a range of policies that disproportionately hurt disabled people. Three years later, the fund is still “under review”. This is despite the Green party’s Caroline Lucas leading calls by MPs from across the political spectrum in 2016 for the fund to be reinstated “as a matter of urgency” and a recommendation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for it to reopen.During last year’s general election, I reported on the consequences of freezing the fund for candidate Mary Griffiths Clarke, who has ME and was living out of her agent’s caravan because she couldn’t afford a hotel, and Emily Brothers, who is blind and hard of hearing, and was unable to run again because she had no way to pay a sighted guide to help her on the campaign trail.It was this that led Brothers to be part of the legal case launched this month, led by the campaign group More United. The others are Liberal Democrat David Buxton, who was Britain’s first ever deaf candidate who used sign language in his 1997 campaign, and Simeon Hart, who is also deaf and stood for the Green party in Oldham West and Royton for the 2015 byelection. Because the access fund had just been closed, Hart had to crowdfund to help raise more than £4,500 that he needed to hire a BSL interpreter for three weeks.\u0026nbspThere’s a risk that any push to finance politicians (or would-be ones) will be greeted with public scepticism. Even years after the expenses scandal, MPs getting subsidised dinners while low income children lose free school meals, for example, understandably cause ire. But just as sensible expenses for MPs prevent a situation in which only the wealthiest citizens are able to take power ,\u0026nbspThere’s good reason for disabled candidates who incur extra costs to have financial support. The access fund means\u0026nbspdisabled would-be politicians have the same shot at gaining office as their non-disabled counterparts. Remove it and many disabled people cannot run for election at all.The fight for the access to elected office fund is about fairness – but really, it’s as much about what sort of politics we want. Too often, white, non-disabled, wealthy men dominate power because of their advantage, not merit. Strip disability funding away and we simply lose more talented would-be politicians. This legal case may ensure that, come the next election, the only thing that matters is who’s the best candidate for the job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5bbd149172955deea6d80f6678080da7c9f6bed/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac1572ffa573ea0814aad6557aac284d","title":"share your views on the causes of loneliness in young people","story":"Help us understand the causes of loneliness from your perspective, as study says young people are most likely to experience itNew research has found loneliness in young people to be a more significant marker than previously thought for issues such as mental health problems and trouble finding work.The King’s College London study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, also says those suffering loneliness are more likely to feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than peers who feel connected to others, regardless of gender or wealth.The report comes soon after the Office for National Statistics found that young people aged 16-24 felt lonely more often than any other age group of adults.

No cause of death has yet been announced.By Tuesday afternoon, more than 2,300 people had signed up to run and donate money to the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people.Using the Facebook group “Finish for Matt”, people across the country posted that they had taken part, with some organising to complete the run with others in their home towns. Campbell, a former MasterChef contestant, was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016. More than £100,000 has been raised for the charity on Campbell’s Just Giving page, with nearly 7,000 inidual donations, despite his initial target being just £2,500.Campbell finished second on BBC Young Chef of the Year when he was 20. After travelling around the world, he returned to the UK and last year made it to the semi-finals of MasterChef: The Professionals. “As many of you know, I lost my father Martin 18 months ago suddenly,” he wrote on his fundraising page. “The past year and a half have been the toughest of my life but his spirit and energy live on in me.”“He was the most inspirational man in my life and was the one who said: ‘Go on, why don’t you give it a go? I know you can do it!’ and entered me into my first marathon,” he went on. “It was maybe the proudest day of my life standing at the finish line having achieved something I never imagined possible with my dad and my brother by my side.”People from across the restaurant industry paid tribute to Campbell, with Simon Rogan, the head chef at L’Enclume, where Campbell previously worked, saying he had “showed a lot of promise, was always very inquisitive and had a nice touch”. The London Marathon race director, Hugh Brasher, said his thoughts were with Campbell’s family and friends, but warned against linking the chef’s death to the high temperatures on Sunday. He said there had been 14 deaths in the last 38 London Marathons.The last death at the race came in 2016, when Afghanistan veteran David Seath had a cardiac arrest three miles short of the finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca39320a1054dc56e13dcd99fb316479280837f/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9c61dbdd37ce0c5b3906a730479fe6","title":"europe gdpr data law employer employee","story":"General Data Protection Regulation holds that anyone in Europe can ask any company for the data it has on themHave you ever wondered what your boss or co-workers say about you behind your back? If you’re located in Europe, it will soon be extremely easy to find out.Under the General Data Protection Regulation that comes into play on 25th of May, any inidual located in Europe can ask any company for the data it collects about them – and that includes their employer.If an employee files a “subject access request” – an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data – their employer will have 30 days to collate a cache of all of the information stored about that person. This includes any email that refers to the worker, as well as performance reviews, job interviews, payroll records, absence records, disciplinary records, computer access logs, CCTV footage, and recordings of phone calls to, from or about the person.This right has been available to iniduals under existing European data protection rules, such as the UK’s Data Protection Act, but GDPR makes it much easier to access by removing the cost (UK companies could charge £10 for such a request before), reducing the turnaround time from 40 days to 30 days and introducing extremely harsh penalties for companies not complying. “It can cost the company tens of thousands of pounds because it’s incredibly resource intensive,” said Jack Carvel, general counsel at Qubit, which provides personalisation software to e-commerce sites.In responding to a subject access request, the company must not include another employee’s personal information. This means that each item must be painstakingly redacted.“Imagine going through every email sent to you or about you,” said Carvel.If a company deletes any of the data to prevent disclosure after the subject access request is made, it can be liable for criminal sanctions.Subject access requests are typically made by employees in some kind of employment dispute with their employer – it’s a free and quick way of getting “predisclosure” ahead of litigation. However, there’s no reason why an employee, former employee or even someone who only had a job interview with the company can’t make such a request just out of interest.Because of how onerous such requests can be, some data privacy experts warn that they could be exploited by activists to punish a company. A group of unhappy former employees could all file requests at the same time, forcing the company to dedicate resources to respond within the 30-day timeframe.“If you look at it from that angle it seems unfair for companies. But think about the pensioner who was refused a mortgage and doesn’t understand why,” said Carvel, referring to a case for which the regulation was designed. “It’s not intended to be for malicious activists or disgruntled employees.”Subject access requests generally allow an inidual to see a copy of the information an organisation holds about them, whether it’s a mortgage lender, social media company or retailer.There are some exceptions to the data that companies must hand over, including information relating to trade secrets, anything relating to current management issues such as restructuring or redundancies, any confidential communications with lawyers, health records, or personal data that is processed for purposes relating to criminal justice and taxation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95350eb1c51f5a56bfb01cd5a3a7fbafc99ccd11/354_970_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b6f371fcdd570cd630ffcbe62c70ebf","title":"amazon key delivers packages to car boots volvo general motors vehicles prime","story":"Latest in Amazon Key programme sees newer Volvos and General Motors vehicles become lockboxes for Prime membersAmazon has begun offering deliveries direct to car boots for members of its Prime subscription service.The new Amazon Key In-Car service is available in 37 US cities for owners of 2015 or newer Volvo or General Motors vehicles, including Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac brands. The cars require GM’s OnStar or Volvo’s On Call connectivity services.Users link their connected car to their Amazon account using the e-commerce firm’s Amazon Key app. No additional hardware is required, and deliveries can be made to cars parked in publicly accessible areas, such as a customer’s home or work.The delivery person approaches the car, unlocks the boot (or trunk), puts the parcel in the car and then secures it, all without needing a key. Users get notifications through the Amazon Key app when their package is out for delivery, once it has been placed in the boot, and can track when their car was opened and closed. Amazon cannot track the location of a shopper’s car, instead they tell Amazon where the vehicle is parked using the app, along with the make, model, colour and licence plate number.“Everything is securely encrypted between the two services,” said Rohit Shrivastava, Amazon Key’s general manager. Atif Rafiq, chief digital officer at Volvo Cars, said: “Receiving a package securely and reliably in your car, without you having to be there, is something we think many people will appreciate. “This mix of car and commerce is starting the next wave of innovation and we intend to be at the forefront.”The in-car deliveries are an extension of the retailer’s existing in-home Amazon Key delivery programme, which was launched last year in the US, using smart locks and a camera to monitor deliveries. But this is not the first in-car delivery service. “We have offered in-car delivery in Europe since 2015 through programs in the Nordics and Switzerland, and we believe that receiving packages should be as easy and convenient as ordering them online,” said Anders Tylman-Mikiewicz, vice president of consumer connectivity services at Volvo.Amazon began testing direct-to-boot deliveries in Germany with a pilot partnership with DHL and Audi in 2015, allowing a small group of Prime subscribers in Munich to receive in-car deliveries. Amazon’s push for in-home and now in-car deliveries is part of the firm’s attempts to secure a larger portion of the grocery and regular consumables market, which has been stymied by the perennial problems of having to be at home to receive deliveries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65db3ca7215a3c6158e10f1c005195ebfeafb10d/0_79_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09af0ce865c6ff97d30fccbcc9c82cfd","title":"apple eu investigation shazam takeover data regulators music recognition","story":"EC concerned £300m deal with music-recognition app could give Apple data on users and rival streaming services to aid poachingThe EU has launched a formal investigation into Apple’s proposed acquisition of UK music-recognition app Shazam.The European commission announced its in-depth investigation into the deal over concerns that it would harm consumer choice and give Apple an unfair advantage through access to user data, which could aid in poaching customers from rivals.Shazam has been downloaded 1bn times and is used 20m times a day. It is the world’s leading music recognition system, able to listen to and identify tracks via a smartphone and then link those tracks to multiple music subscription services, which means it could therefore hold commercially sensitive data on Apple’s competitors and their consumers.Noting that Apple Music has become the second-largest music streaming service in Europe, the EC said: “Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors’ customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.”The EC will also investigate whether it would have a material affect on competitors, if Apple were to discontinue referral from Shazam to the likes of Spotify and Dezer.A deal between Apple and Shazam, reportedly worth £300m, was confirmed in December as a move to help the iPhone-maker better compete with market-leader Spotify. The EC launched a preliminary review of the takeover in February following a request from seven European countries including France, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Regulators will now have until 4 September to decide whether to permit the takeover.Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: “The way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services.“Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won’t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.”Apple is locked in a battle on multiple fronts within the music streaming business. It was late to the game, allowing Swedish rival Spotify to build a commanding position. Spotify has 71 million paying subscribers and a popular free, ad-supported tier. Apple Music had 38 million paying subscribers in March and the Shazam deal would also boost Apple’s ability to compete with Google’s voice-assistant services. Google Assistant already has a music-recognition system baked in, where Apple’s Siri does not, which has led to it being perceived by users as a distant third in capability behind Google’s offering and Amazon’s Alexa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d492c16f8acdabc4ea23a001ae1471037ebe72c/3_0_4547_2731/master/4547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20afb3688c937d9789595c808372501e","title":"huawei p20 pro review three camera iphone top end smartphone","story":"The Chinese smartphone maker has hit a home run with this top-end smartphone that’s on a par with the best With the P20 Pro, Huawei has not only proved that it can compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung, but it can beat them in many ways. Three cameras really are better than one (or two).Having established its name in value smartphones, Huawei has recently made inroads into the premium market with the likes of the Mate 10 Pro and last year’s P10. They were of high quality, and had all the features you’d expect from an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S. But until now they’ve not quite captured the same luxurious feel. The P20 Pro has a 6.1in full HD+ OLED screen, bigger than even the Mate 10 Pro, but squeezed into a compact body with tiny bezels rivalling Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. It also has a notch in the top – a cutout in the screen that contains a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, the earpiece speaker and various sensors. The screen is bright and colourful, although not quite as pixel dense as rivals, and text is not quite as pin-sharp when viewed side-by-side. It’s a beautiful display that is close, but not quite as good as the best from Samsung or Apple.Unlike rivals, Huawei has kept its best-in-class fingerprint scanner on the front, squeezed into an oval shape at the bottom of the screen. The back is glass with curved edges that blend neatly into the rounded and polished metal band around the sides. The camera modules stick out the back similar to an iPhone X, which means it doesn’t sit flush on a desk.At 7.8mm thick and 180g in weight, the P20 Pro feels thin with an luxurious quality to it. It’s 0.7mm thinner and 9g lighter than Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, but 0.1mm thicker and 6g heavier than Apple’s iPhone X. All of which is to say the Huawei matches up well.The P20 Pro is also water resistant to IP67 standards, meaning up to 1m of water for up to 30 minutes – good enough to survive a trip down the toilet or into the bath.The P20 Pro has the same processor and memory configuration as the Mate 10 Pro – Huawei’s own Kirin 970 octo-core processor and its neural network processing unit – and as such is as fast and powerful as the earlier handset, keeping pace with its rivals.The P20 Pro lasts significantly longer than both Apple and Samsung’s best between charges, although not quite as long as the 50-hours the Mate 10 Pro lasts. The P20 Pro consistently lasted over 39 hours on a single charge without having to activate any power saving modes. That was with two sims in it, using the smartphone as a primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours a day with hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Netflix, the odd spot of navigation in Google maps, shooting around 30 photos and listening to around four hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.There’s no wireless charging, but the P20 Pro charges pretty fast using the supplied power adapter and USB-C cable, despite having a comparatively large battery.The P20 Pro runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.1, based on Android Oreo 8.1, making it right up to date on launch.It behaves very similarly to EMUI 8 running on the Mate 10 Pro – there is a Google Feed on the home screen and it offers the option to have an app drawer or force every app to have an icon on the home screen a la Apple’s iOS.Various power-saving features are built in, including a system to keep rogue apps from destroying your battery life. Huawei’s ultra power-saving mode can significantly extend the battery life by disabling functions and limiting the number of apps you can use, if you really need your smartphone to last four days.EMUI handles the notch in the screen very well, acting more like a screen with two ears at the top than one with a disruptive cutout. Notifications and other icons easily fit either side of the notch in the status bar, which by default is either transparent or colour-matched to the content on screen. There’s also an option to make it black all the time, effectively hiding the notch entirely.The big difference between the approach Huawei has used v that of Apple for the iPhone X is that when content or apps are displayed on the screen the area either side of the notch is blocked off so that it doesn’t intrude into what’s on-screen.Some will simply hate the idea of the notch, but being narrow and using the space either side of it as the status bar is actually a good compromise.The P20 Pro is the first smartphone to have not one, not two, but three cameras on the back, all working in conjunction to provide a multi-layered camera experience.The primary camera is a large, 40-megapixel colour camera with an f1.8 lens, which is joined by a 20-megapixel monochrome camera with an f1.6 lens and an eight megapixel telephoto camera with an f2.4 lens.The system automatically uses a combination of the cameras on the back to produce each shot. The monochrome camera adds extra light, detail and depth information, while the telephoto camera increases the zoom magnification.The combination produces excellent detail, low noise and accurate colour capture. In good light it shoots images that are stunning. In low light the P20 Pro excels too, routinely producing better images than rivals.But it is the hybrid zoom that really makes the P20 Pro really stand out. Many dual-camera smartphones offer up to a 2x zoom, which often proves rather modest. The Huawei offers up to 5x hybrid zoom, with steps all the way up and a button to switch between 1x, 3x and 5x zoom. Images shot at 3x and 5x zoom are very good, even in low light. There are plenty of modes to play with, including portrait and aperture modes, a monochrome mode that uses the dedicated camera, and an excellent long exposure night mode, which works very well even when handheld.The P20 Pro also captures very good video, including up to 960fps slow motion, and has a “Pro” mode with plenty of settings to keep most photographers happy, including RAW capture.By default the camera shoots 10-megapixel images, but there’s an option to shoot at the full 40-megapixel size, which can be fun.Huawei’s built-in camera AI performs real-time object recognition to detect the subject and switch to the appropriate mode or scene. In most circumstances it does an admirable job, but occasionally it would get caught between scenes, such as “greenery” and “flower” when trying to shoot a bunch of roses. I also found some of the modes to artificially skew the colours in the image a bit too much for my liking, making them look like photos tweaked for Instagram. I turned it off for some shoots and got better results.The front-facing selfie camera is also very good, producing well detailed and lit shots, complete with your choice of beautification effects, such as the face-shaping “perfect selfie” mode.The Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage and is available in three colours.For comparison, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.3in Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with 64GB of storage costs £869, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in OnePlus 5T with 64GB costs £449, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.With the P20 Pro Huawei has finally produced something that I would recommend over competitors regardless of the price. While not cheap, costing £800, in some ways you get a better experience than rivals costing £200 more.But the P20 Pro isn’t a value proposition it is a no-holds-barred attempt to usurp the current kings of the top-end smartphone, Samsung and Apple. The Mate 10 Pro was great, but Huawei has hit a home run with the P20 Pro.It’s a fantastic-looking phone that feels better than rivals in the hand, lasts significantly longer between charges and has a one of the best cameras available, offering useful features that others can’t match.There’s no wireless charging, no headphone socket, EMUI has its quirks and Huawei’s record of keeping up with software and security updates is a bit patchy. But it’s truly great to see a company that isn’t Apple or Samsung pushing boundaries once more.Cons: no headphone socket, no microSD card slot, no wireless charging, screen not the highest resolution, no Bluetooth 5 support"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90afdac0e631f57175ca18791bce102a2087e2c/0_26_1179_707/master/1179.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc1b799ba32d45302e89c923fec2bf2","title":"azerbaijan ruling families linked to secret investments via maltese bank","story":"President’s children among alleged beneficiaries of multimillion-pound global investments by networks of companiesAzerbaijan’s ruling families are the alleged beneficiaries of dozens of anonymously owned companies that have been used to invest in property, hotels and businesses in Europe, according to an investigation by the Daphne Project.Over the past three years, several networks of companies appear to have used a private bank in Malta for secret investments in the UK, Spain, France, Georgia and Montenegro, research by the project found. Many of the companies were allegedly operated for the benefit of the children of Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, and the sons of his minister for emergency situations, Kamaladdin Heydarov, according to three sources with knowledge of the transactions.Their claims are supported by information in the public domain, and a leak from Dubai residency records.Aliyev’s daughters, Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva, did not respond to a request for comment.Lawyers for Heydarov’s sons, Nijat and Tale, said: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies … which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.”Although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing, the disclosures are likely to raise new questions for Azerbaijan’s ruling elites, who have been widely criticised for a lack of transparency since Aliyev took power in 2003.He has been accused of presiding over a regime that has imprisoned journalists, committed human rights abuses and allowed looting of state assets by public officials. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has repeatedly called for the country to be more open and provide greater transparency as part of necessary anti-corruption measures.The president has denounced any criticism of his government as a “smear” and accused western media of waging a “biased, groundless and provocative” campaign against Azerbaijan’s leaders.The investigation shows the breadth of previously unreported investments owned by some of the elite, and how Malta has been used as a gateway for them to buy and manage assets across Europe and the rest of the world.At the heart of the network are companies that were clients of Pilatus bank, whose headquarters are in Malta and assets are frozen pending the outcome of an investigation initiated by the country’s banking regulator last month.The information appears to show for the first time that the president’s daughters own a half share in Gilan Holding, one of Azerbaijan’s largest businesses, with interests in banking, construction, tourism, agriculture and Gabala football club.Gilan Holding was founded by Heydarov in the 1980s and became one of Azerbaijan’s most successful companies before being handed to his sons, before Heydarov entered government.Assets allegedly held by the families through companies that were customers of Pilatus bank include:The Maltese regulator has declined to comment on the focus of its inquiry at Pilatus, and there is no suggestion those named in this article acted illegally. A collaboration of 18 news organisations, including the , Reuters and the New York Times, has been researching Pilatus. Led by France’s Forbidden Stories, the Daphne Project was created to continue the investigations of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Fifty companies and trusts, almost all of which are owned anonymously, have been traced. They appear to belong to at least five separate groupings of companies, whose key entities were incorporated in Malta from the summer of 2014 onwards.Pilatus, the bank for many of the companies, opened its headquarters in the European Union’s smallest member state in January 2014.Azeri-controlled accounts at Pilatus are frozen, along with those of all other customers. The measures followed the arrest of the bank’s Iranian owner in Washington in March. Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad is in custody awaiting prosecution for alleged money laundering and sanctions violations in relation to his business affairs before arriving in Malta.The Pilatus scandal surfaced last year when an employee blew the whistle on the bank. Her claims, first reported by Caruana Galizia and later repeated to a European parliament inquiry, were that the customers of Pilatus included Leyla Aliyeva and Maltese politicians. The claims surfaced at a time when Azerbaijan was completing a major investment in the Maltese energy sector through a share in a power station.Two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have confirmed her testimony: they say the Aliyev and Heydarov families were clients. Keith Schembri, the chief of staff of Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has also confirmed he was a client.In response to a letter from the , lawyers for the Heydarov sons stated: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies which hold accounts at Pilatus bank in Malta, which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.” They say the structure was set up to hold European property and assets, and their ownership in many cases was in the public domain. “Where it is not, there are legitimate public-interest reasons to keep the fact of ownership private, for example where the companies hold property used by our clients for residential purposes, that ownership may be kept private for security reasons,” the lawyers said.Robert Baker, an Australian who lives in Britain, appears as a director of multiple entities with Pilatus accounts. Public filings list his address as a £2m house in west London.The largest grouping of companies, owned by the Heydarov brothers via anonymous New Zealand holding companies set up as recently as November, has invested tens of millions of pounds in European assets.These include a €3.9m (£3.4m) villa in Marbella and the $2.5m purchase of a former sanatorium in Georgia, which reports say is to be developed into a 100-room hotel at a cost of $40m.The brothers own three French artisanal businesses: a maker of china plates in Limoges for high-end restaurants, another producing cartoon character figurines, and a supplier of bed linen to the Élysée Palace. The linen company, D Porthault, hosted a visit by Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, last autumn.Despite repeated requests for information, the  understands that managers of these businesses, all acquired in 2014 and 2015, were never told who their ultimate owner was. The manager of the Limoges factory told the newspaper Le Monde, a partner in the Daphne Project: “It’s incredible, it’s been three years now that my questions have gone unanswered.”Two London townhouses worth a combined £16m belong to a New Zealand company called Kubernao Trust Limited, which has a Pilatus account. Baker is a former shareholder, according to public company records, and is still listed as a director. It is not known who ultimately owns the properties because their identity is hidden behind a New Zealand nominee.Lawyers for Baker said their client was “appalled” by the murder of Caruana Galizia and he had “at all times acted with the utmost good faith and integrity, and where appropriate, sought the assistance of the appropriate experts”.They declined to comment on the ownership of the companies of which Baker was a director, saying: “Confidentiality, privacy and discretion are the fundamental requirements for service providers in the consultation, management and administration of family funds and private banking.”One of the biggest revelations is that the Aliyev daughters may have a majority stake in Gilan. The Heydarov family have always presented the conglomerate as theirs. However, two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have now confirmed that the owners of Sahra FZCO were declared to Pilatus as Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva.Asked about the ownership, lawyers for the Heydarov brothers said their clients would not comment “for confidentiality and security reasons”. Property records, obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, show Sahra holds two plots on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah island.The plots are occupied by the 360-room Sofitel Dubai resort. While the family is understood to own the building, the hotel is managed by Accor. It appears that Accor, a top 40 company on the Paris bourse, is a partner with Aliyev interests in a total of three hotels. Sahra appears to have been connected through a franchise arrangement with another Accor hotel in Dubai, the Mercure Barsha Heights. And the French group operates the Fairmont in Baku, previously reported as being linked to the Aliyevs.Accor said it could not ulge details of commercial relationships.• This article was amended on 24 April 2018 to clarify that Robert Baker is not a director of any Pilatus entities.Additional reporting by Miranda Patrucic, Khadija Ismayilova, Jean-Baptiste Chastand and Anne Michel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2ed59374d36b16dfff26535a3d480045e30299/0_99_3904_2343/master/3904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d44415110576bd139915a7cd95b11e5","title":"student says peking university trying to silence her over claim petition","story":"Young activist publishes letter alleging harassment over role in movement calling for more accountability over campus sex assaultsA student activist calling for transparency over an alleged rape at China’s top university has accused the university of trying to silence her.Earlier this month, former classmates of a literature student at Peking University (PKU) who killed herself in 1998 came forward to say she had been raped by her professor, Shen Yang, who denies the allegation. PKU and two other universities subsequently cut ties with Shen and a group of current PKU students petitioned the school to hand over all documents related to the case. The case is at the centre of a small but growing #MeToo movement among students at PKU and other universities across China who have been calling for more accountability over sexual assault on campuses. The movement is unusual in an environment where any activism, especially among students, is closely monitored and stamped out.One of the students who signed the petition, Yue Xin, a senior at the university’s school of foreign languages, published a letter on Monday alleging harassment and intimidation. Yue said she has been called in for several meetings with school officials, often lasting until late into the night. She accused administrators of suggesting she might not be able to graduate and asking what her mother and grandmother would think of her behaviour.Yue claims that at about 1am on Monday, her adviser, accompanied by Yue’s mother, stormed into her dorm room, waking her and forcing her to delete all documents from her computer related to the petition. Afterwards Yue’s parents drove her home. She has not been able to return to school, Yue said in the letter, according to a translation by China Digital Times.Student activism at Peking University has a long history, dating back to 1919 when thousands of students protested against a treaty granting Chinese territory to Japan, the 4 May  movement. In 1989, student activists converged again in Beijing on Tiananmen Square to call for reforms in demonstrations that were put down by force.Online searches for Yue’s name have been blocked and her post has been deleted, but not before users recorded it using blockchain technology. Others have circulated a screenshot of her letter upside down to avoid censors on the WeChat.A photo of a poster on a university bulletin board, a gesture reminiscent of banners and leaflets posted on the the school’s former “democracy wall”, used during the 1989 protests, circulated on social media. PKU’s school of foreign languages said on its website on Monday that Yue’s mother had been summoned out of concern because Yue could not be reached. “We always honour every student’s fundamental rights and make great effort to protect each and every student’s lawful rights”, the school said.According to Yue, the school responded to the petition by saying there were no minutes of the meeting where Shen’s behaviour was discussed. Because of an error, the relevant department did not have Shen’s statement on the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d37f0b205ec3682f8d0c6a3f28b9b705bd64b/0_228_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab332e0ac7f7a33691799b00fc3ae29","title":"emmanuel macron goes to washington in pictures","story":"The French president and his wife Brigitte opened their pomp-filled three-day state visit with a double date with Donald and Melania Trump at George Washington’s house"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471788.1524515057!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water to seek planning permission for shannon pipeline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Over half of the water produced is used in our homes and businesses. The rest, 658m litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day”Irish Water has rejected the concerns of hundreds of objectors to its plan to extract water from the river Shannon and pipe it to Dublin in a €1.3 billion project set to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population from 2025.Taking the water from Parteen basin on the Shannon in north Tipperary is the best way to ensure a sustainable water source for both Dublin and major towns in the midlands located close to the proposed 170km pipeline, and to provide sufficient capacity to allow for population growth and economic development up to 2050, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of options published on Tuesday.Having taken on board the views of more than 1,000 “stakeholders” in the final phase of a public consultation process, the utility confirmed it would now go ahead and seek planning permission for the project from An Bord Pleanála next year.It said future water needs of the eastern and the midlands regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It has also published a detailed response to concerns raised on the route chosen, and addressed issues highlighted about the environmental impact of the project.Having updated data on water consumption projections and included latest census figures, it said it stands by its original analysis justifying the project, which has been subjected to sustained criticism from the River Shannon Protection Alliance and Fight the Pipe campaign, representing 500 landowners along the route.The “Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region” would end over-dependence on the river Liffey to serve the Dublin region, and provide an additional 330 million litres of water a day which Irish Water says will be needed by the region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The utility highlights the current lack of sufficient “headroom” to meet peak demands on supply in certain scenarios, such as a climate change event. “Failure to provide for such events will guarantee repeated supply failure, with its severe social and economic consequences,” it warns in its latest report.In response to analysis by the financial consultant Emma Kennedy, who has advised some of the environmental groups objecting to the plan, it says future water needs of the eastern and the midland regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It admits leakage in Dublin is “unacceptably high”, but rejects her conclusion the project would be unnecessary if Irish Water addressed its “extremely unambitious leakage-reduction targets” in the capital.Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said existing raw water sources for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) would be at capacity by 2025, and water saved from fixing leaks under its leakage-reduction programme would not be enough to meet future demand.Leakage in the Greater Dublin Area network is at 36 per cent, and there are 9,000km of water pipes, “greater than the distance between Dublin and Beijing” – many of them date back to the Victorian times, and therefore vulnerable to leaks.At present Irish Water is rolling out a comprehensive programme to address leaks which includes an initial investment of €500 million which “will save 166 million litres of water a day by 2021 – enough to supply Cork city twice over”.“However, this cannot keep pace with growth needs,” Mr Laffey said. This is before allowing for extreme weather events such as the drought that affected the midlands last summer or the multiple bursts and water shortages following Storm Emma.Irish Water produces 1.67 billion litres of water every day nationally, which is distributed through 63,000km of water main. Leakage is spread over the entire extent of this infrastructure, not just older pipes, it says.“Over half of the water produced is used in our homes and businesses. The rest, 658 million litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day,” the report adds.Ireland’s leakage is high compared to other EU countries due to a combination of factors, including the age and condition of pipes, poor performance of certain pipe materials, soil conditions, length of the network and “lack of investment in water infrastructure over the past 150 years”.In the Greater Dublin Water supply area (GDWSA) 207 million litres of water are lost daily. “To drive down leakage water savings must be delivered faster than the rate which new leaks occur” which adds to Dublin’s difficulties, Irish Water says. “Leakage-reduction within the GDWSA is an absolute priority. It is not a choice of either delivering leakage savings or building a new supply.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471673.1524506487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shannon critical for reliable long term dublin water supply","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Shannon river. Following extraction and treatment, water will be piped to a termination point reservoir in Co Dublin before connecting into the greater Dublin network. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Existing water supply sources “do not have the capacity or resilience to meet future requirements of homes and businesses in Dublin and the midlands”, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of the proposal to extract water from the river Shannon and to pipe it to Dublin.The utility says extraction from the Shannon at Parteen, Co Tipperary, is best suited “to meet urgent water needs” of the greater Dublin and heavily-populated midland towns along the 170km pipeline route. The project is costed at €1.3 billion with a view to homes and businesses receiving the new supply by 2025.The evaluation of “final options” includes analysis of the project based on new data and includes Irish Water’s detailed response to issues raised in the latest public consultation phase on the project.It rejects all questions raised about the need for the project recent criticism of its analysis of projected water needs for Dublin, and a failure to address the capital’s leakage problem which is among the worst in the EU.The Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region (WSP) – “will deliver a secure, reliable and sustainable long-term water supply that will be critical to support the eastern and midlands region’s social and economic growth from 2025”, it adds.It will be the biggest upgrade to Ireland’s water source infrastructure in more than 60 years, ease overdependence on the Liffey, and ultimately provide an additional 330 million litres a day Irish Water says will be needed by the Dublin region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The pipeline is intended to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population, which is concentrated in and around Dublin.Following extraction at Parteen and treatment nearby at Birdhill, water will be piped to a termination point reservoir at Peamount in Co Dublin before connecting into the greater Dublin network.Communities in North Tipperary, Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, it says, will also benefit from the project with possible future off-shoots from the pipe that will enable the development of extra homes and businesses and increase potential inward investment.Apart from the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), “the most urgent areas with impending water deficits in the region are the Mullingar supply area of Westmeath and the rapidly expanding area of east Meath bordering the GDA”, it notes.Following its publication, Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said: “The recently-published National Planning Framework confirmed the urgent need for a new long-term water supply source for the eastern and midlands region by the mid-2020s, to provide for projected growth up to 2050 and to ensure that the region has a safe, secure and resilient water supply for the region.”More than 1,000 stakeholders participated in the consultation and a wide range of issues were raised by the public.“Their engagement and input has helped us develop a long-term strategic investment project that we believe is environmentally sustainable and will bring economic benefits to the whole country,” he added.Forecast population and economic growth would generate “a demand for an additional 330 million litres of water per day by 2050 to give both the GDA and the midlands regions the resilience and reliability of service that is essential to inspire public confidence and continue to attract economic opportunity”, Mr Laffey said.An infrastructural deficit was made clear when Storm Emma struck Ireland recently and the Greater Dublin Water Supply Area was found to have “operational headroom” to meet peak demand of only 1.5 per cent, which resulted in large-scale water outages and water restrictions. This alone underlined the WSP “is very, very urgent”, he said.“If we continue to operate without the required headroom, we can expect more frequent water outages… In a properly functioning water utility, the target resource headroom should never be less than 13-15 per cent for major urban centres,” the report states.Assessment of options over many years had identified “the Parteen Basin option delivers the widest benefit to the greatest number of people with the least environmental impact and in the most cost effective manner”, he said.An environmental impact assessment report and Natura impact statement are being prepared for submission with the planning application.While Irish Water’s latest WSP report marks the formal end of consultation, it says it “will continue to meet with interested stakeholders to make sure we work together to deliver the vision of a safe, secure and sustainable water source for the eastern and midlands region”.The feedback received and Irish Water’s response are available at watersupplyproject.ie"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3472514.1524576694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster bank offers emergency cash as money vanishes from accounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn some instances, customers have had their Ulster Bank credit and debit cards declined when making purchases. Photograph: Alan BetsonMoney, including monthly salaries has been disappearing from the accounts of Ulster Bank customers since the weekend prompting the bank to launch what it says is an urgent investigation. The issues are not expected to be resolved until tomorrow morning at the earliest.The bank has told impacted customers, who find their accounts overdrawn as a result of the problems, that they will not be out of pocket once the issue is resolved. And it said it will be making emergency cash of up to €500 available to customers who need it. Ulster Bank customers began reporting issues in significant numbers on Monday and hundreds of complaints have now been posted across social media networks from people who have had money disappear from their accounts leaving them without the funds to pay direct debits which are due. In others instances customers have had their Ulster Bank credit and debit cards declined when making purchases. It appears that money lodged since Friday has left customer accounts.“What’s going on with your banking system again? Transfers done now reversed. Card payments done now missing. Balance available is all over the place,” said one Twitter user.Another asked what the bank was doing about the money disappearing from current accounts? “My April salary was paid last Friday but today it has disappeared,” he said. “I have just had my card declined. I am getting no answer on the phone, every penny gone from both accounts. Ulster bank did not reach out to customers, I have direct debits due today and no money at all...as soon as this is sorted I am changing banks.”A bank spokeswoman said it was “aware some transactions applied to customers accounts since 20th April are no longer showing. We are investigating this issue as a matter of urgency and apologise for any inconvenience caused.” She said no customer would be left out of pocket as a result of this issue and “emergency cash” is being made available in branch or via telephone banking. The bank has assured affected customers that if they are overdrawn as a result of this issue their account will be “rectified as soon as the issue is resolved and we will ensure no customer is out of pocket”.It it thought that impacted transactions will processed overnight on Monday and customers’ accounts should revert to their normal position on Tuesday morning.At the end of March the bank also reported delays in payments sent from Ulster Bank being processed. A massive technical meltdown at Ulster Bank in 2012 left huge numbers of its customers without access to funds for weeks and led to the Central Bank imposing a fine on the bank of €5million for the IT failure.Describing it as a “disgraceful situation” Sinn Fein’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty pointed out that it was six years since the “glitch” which left tens of thousands of the ban’s customers without access to funds for weeks and he said it suggested the bank’s systems were “still not up to scratch” and he called for the bank to appear before the Oireachtas Finance Committee. The apparent IT failure at the bank was described as a “cause of serious concern” by Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath. He called for the Central Bank to “conduct a comprehensive review of the IT systems used by retail banks in Ireland”. “It is very distressing for Ulster Bank customers to discover that money has gone missing from their bank account or that they may have had debit card transactions declined. In some cases, customers may well have missed vital payments as a result of the bank’s failure,” he said.“Ulster Bank now needs to put its customers first. The bank’s immediate focus must be on fixing this problem and ensure that affected customers will not have their credit rating adversely affected in any way.”He said IT failures were happening “all too often at Ulster Bank and the question has to be asked if it is the result of a lack of investment by the bank”. “It is every bank’s responsibility to ensure that their IT systems are fit for purpose.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

The government will now look at other ideas to reform its social security system.Supporters argue that a universal basic income would provide a safety net and boost innovation, creativity and personal well-being, as well as helping the unemployed find temporary work.It would counteract the insecurity of increasing number of short term contracts offered employees and boost labour mobility by encouraging workers to take the risk of moving jobs.“The eagerness of the government is evaporating,” Olli Kangas, one of the experiment\u0027s designers told the BBC.Professor Kangas said the government had turned down a request to expand the scheme to pay up to £61 million to fund the basic income for employed Finns rather than the group of 2,000 unemployed people.Finland’s unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent, higher than its Nordic neighbours, and complex benefits system had fuelled calls for an ambitious rethink.We cannot be tempted by a Universal Basic Income - it would do huge damage to the economyA report by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce said in February that the British government should consider giving £10,000 to every British citizen under the age of 55 as part of a universal basic income fund.  Nicola Sturgeon called for research into the idea for Scotland in 2017 and the idea was part of the UK Green Party\u0027s manifesto that year.  In February, the OECD think tank said that a universal credit system replacing benefits payments with a single sum, such as that being introduced in Britain, would work better than a universal basic income.In 2016, Swiss voters rejected a plan to introduce a guaranteed basic income for all, regardless of whether or not they were employed.More than three quarters of referendum voters opposed a plan offering an unconditional monthly income of £1,755 for each adult and £458 for each child.Please review our commenting policyTens of thousands raised for MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died during London MarathonRoyal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementVillage invaded by Kashmiri goats after bad weather drives them inlandCourts may have created accidental bigamists by wrongly applying orce rulesBaby giraffe makes bid for freedom from Indiana zoo‘Unlimited, disrespectful and excessive’ – is the party over for tourism in Ibiza?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsChildren have energy levels greater than endurance athletes, scientists findMummified body of the Shah of Iran \u0026#39found in Tehran\u0026#39 construction siteHas Iceland been over-estimating its growth in tourism?Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyAustralian boy, 12, runs away to Bali using family credit cardInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

It began around 1.30pm Toronto time on Monday. Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, was attending a meeting of G7 ministers in the city, but the gathering was not near the site of the incident. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said: \u0026quotWe\u0027re still gathering information and as soon as we can, we\u0027ll share more information with Canadians.\u0026quotMr Trudeau added:  \u0026quotOur thoughts are with all those affected by the terrible incident at Yonge and Finch in Toronto. Thank you to the first responders working at the scene – we\u0027re monitoring the situation closely\u0026quot.Numerous witnesses, many of whom appeared shaken by the incident, described seeing the van swerving to hit pedestrians.James Forrester saw the aftermath of the incident from the 19th floor of an office building where he works as a financial services representative with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “Police were just arriving, people were screaming, there were bodies on the  ground, and I saw a lot of blood,” he told The .Mr Forrester described seeing three dead bodies on the pavement covered by orange sheets, about 10 ambulances, seven police cars and an estimated crowd of 30 onlookers. Police said nine people have been killed in the attack, while 16 more are injuredHe added that the white van travelled about two kilometres before it was stopped by police, and that as many as 40 people may have been hit. Henry Miller, who lives in an apartment overlooking the street, told Sky News: \u0026quotI heard a large amount of honking...and I stepped out onto the balcony to see what was causing the trouble and at this point I saw a lady lying on the floor and the van driving off with people running around trying to help her\u0026quot.The van injured around ten people in Toronto, according to reportsOne witness described seeing a middle-aged man “barely moving” on the ground after being hit. He told CNN: “I feel sick to my stomach ... I’ve never seen anything like this before.\u0026quotKash Alavi, another witness, described seeing victims with faces “full of blood”, telling CNN that the legs of those hit had been \u0026quottwisted and contorted\u0026quot. Another witness speaking to the network who did not give his name became emotional describing how the van swerved to repeatedly hit pedestrians. “He’s just hitting people one by one by one. It was a nightmare,” he said. The van “just went on the side walk and started hitting everyone”, he added. A woman stands crying in the aftermath of the incidentThe witness said seeing a pushchair “split in half” and a group of people sitting on a bench being hit by the van. He said what he had witnessed was like “a war zone”.Meaghan Gray, a Toronto police spokesman, said: \u0026quotAt this point it\u0027s too early to tell what if any motive there was\u0026quot.Kim McKinnon, Toronto paramedic spokesman, said at least eight ambulances took victims of the incident to nearby Sunnybrook hospital.Andrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has issued a statement, extending his condolences to those who had lost loved ones in the attack and said the inidual responsible should feel the full force of the law.“We have all seen by now the incredible footage of a police officer staring down the attacker alone on a city street.“The men and women of our police services represent the best of what it means to be Canadian, and today we thank them.“I am confident that all Canadians stand in support of the people of Toronto as they come together to support families impacted by this tragedy. The stories of bravery, selflessness, and kindness that have emerged have been an inspiration to an entire nation.”Mr Saunders is asked about sources saying police have ruled out a connection to Isil or international terrorism, but he won\u0027t be drawn. \u0026quotI\u0027m not going to answer what the media are putting forward,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotWe open lanes and we explore.\u0026quotIf there is no evidence to support a theory, he says, then it is closed - but not until then.Mark Saunders, the Toronto police chief, is taking questions from journalists. He says the suspect, Alek Minassian, was not known to police as far as he could tell so far. But he said the van had driven on the wrong side of the road and repeatedly mounted the kerb. \u0026quotIt\u0027s very clear from a general perspective that the actions looked deliberate,\u0026quot he said.He added that the suspect was not armed and that police were investigating whether he had accomplices.Speaking to the media, Ralph Goodale, Canadian Public Safety Minister, said so far there was \u0026quotno national security connection to this particular incident\u0026quot.However, officials are at pains to say the investigation is at an early stage.City officials are briefing the media now. Key points from Mark Saunders, the Toronto police chief, so far:Named as Alek Minassian, a 25-year-old student from Richmond HillIncreased death toll - 10 dead and 15 wounded and in hospitalA woman signs a memorial card for the victims near the scene on Yonge StAn impromptu memorial has been set up close to the scene of the deaths. We are expecting a news briefing any minute to bring us up to date with happened.A senior national government official later said that authorities had not turned over the investigation to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a sign that investigators believed it unlikely terrorism was the motive, according to the Associated Press. The official agreed to reveal that information only if not quoted by name.Ralph Goodale, Canadian Public Safety Minister, said he had no evidence to suggest Canada\u0027s national threat level needed to be raised following today’s attack in Toronto.\u0026quotThere is no information available to me at the present time that would indicate a change in the risk level,\u0026quot Mr Goodale told reporters in Toronto, where he is attending the G7 foreign and security ministers meeting.The suspect in the Toronto van attack that killed nine people and injured 16 others is a 25-year-old man named Alek Minassian, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said on Monday.He is believed to be a student at Seneca College in Toronto.He reportedly lives in Richmond Hill, north of Toronto.Phil Zullo was headed north driving along Yonge Street, Toronto’s main artery, early Monday afternoon when he saw a bus shelter down, poles bent over, shoes along the road, “and then body after body after body” for a three-block stretch.“People were mangled on the sidewalk.“At first I saw what I thought was a stroller – and said to myself ‘please don’t make me see a kid,’ but I got closer and saw it was a walker,\u0026quot said Mr Zullo, 47, who runs a fitness facility in the city and estimated that he saw between 10 and 15 bodies on the ground.“I called my wife and said, ‘I think I just saw a terrorist attack.’”He said that thousands of people live and work in the area, and that dozens of police officers and emergency responders converged on the scene “from everywhere” providing CPR to the victims.“It was as if they had done this a hundred times. These guys were unbelievable.”Mr Zullo also saw the suspect, leaning against a police cruiser, surrounded by three officers who handcuffed him.He described the man as dark-skinned, clean-shaven, bald and wearing glasses. The man reportedly pointed his cellphone at police as if it were a weapon.“This has never happened here,” said Mr Zullo. “But why not us?”Officers at the sceneUsers in the area can check in and let friends know they are safe hereCanadians at home and all around the world are doing their Canadian thing, keeping calm and not jumping to conclusions.The Toronto Maple Leafs are playing the Boston Bruins in a play-off game tonight.

We can confirm right now that we have nine people that are dead, sixteen that are injured. \u0026quotI can assure the public that all available resources have been brought in to investigate this situation.\u0026quot Mr Yuen appealed for eye witnesses to contact police in order to help with their enquiries.The city\u0027s police chief, Mark Saunders, who was in New York at the time of the incident, travelled back to Toronto on Monday night to oversee the investigation.The city\u0027s mayor, John Tory, appealed for calm in the aftermath of the incident as he praised the “professionalism” and “thoroughness” of the emergency services, saying he hoped the city’s “spirit of unity” would continue after the incident. \u0026quotI hope that we will as a city remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive, and for being accepting, understanding and considerate,\u0026quot Mr Tory said.Claudia Panfil, a spokeswoman for Ryder Systems, confirmed that one of the company\u0027s rental vehicles was involved in Monday\u0027s tragedy. Ms Panfil said the company was co-operating with authorities.Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementVillage invaded by Kashmiri goats after bad weather drives them inlandCourts may have created accidental bigamists by wrongly applying orce rulesBaby giraffe makes bid for freedom from Indiana zoo‘Unlimited, disrespectful and excessive’ – is the party over for tourism in Ibiza?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsTens of thousands raised for MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died during London MarathonChildren have energy levels greater than endurance athletes, scientists findMummified body of the Shah of Iran \u0026#39found in Tehran\u0026#39 construction siteHas Iceland been over-estimating its growth in tourism?Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyAustralian boy, 12, runs away to Bali using family credit cardInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Tens of thousands raised for MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died during London MarathonRoyal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family Royal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementVillage invaded by Kashmiri goats after bad weather drives them inlandCourts may have created accidental bigamists by wrongly applying orce rulesBaby giraffe makes bid for freedom from Indiana zoo‘Unlimited, disrespectful and excessive’ – is the party over for tourism in Ibiza?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsChildren have energy levels greater than endurance athletes, scientists findMummified body of the Shah of Iran \u0026#39found in Tehran\u0026#39 construction siteHas Iceland been over-estimating its growth in tourism?Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyAustralian boy, 12, runs away to Bali using family credit cardInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet. After seven years of marriage (and three children), the Duke and Duchess now know exactly who their real friends are.Plus, with 12 godparents between them, Prince George and Princess Charlotte have already ticked off all those their parents felt obliged to ask. Admittedly a few of their oldest and best friends have already been bagged – Emilia d’Erlanger, for example, is George’s godmother and Prince William’s friend, Tom Van Straubenzee belongs to Chalotte – but there are plenty more of their friends waiting in the wings, as well as a few close cousins. Click here for our best guestimate at who might be in the frame for possible godparents to the new prince.Some of the runners and riders in our shortlist in the race to become the youngest royal\u0026#39s godparents It would be a worst nightmare for most new mothers, but the Duchess of Cambridge had a close knit team of helpers on hand to help ensure she looked her best for her moment in front of the world\u0027s media.For the past few years, the Duchess has worked closely with former PA Natasha Archer and hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker to ensure that her every public appearance is pristine.Natasha Archer and Amanda Cook Tucker arriving to tend to Kate after the birth of Prince GeorgeThe duo are often spotted loading vanity cases and suit carriers onto the royal jet during tours or lurking behind the scenes to tend to the Duchess whenever she needs.Here is everything you need to know about the Royal \u0026quotglam squad\u0026quot, who were on hand for the Duchess\u0027s Lindo Wing exit.Arthur remains the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for the new Royal baby\u0027s name, but James is the most popular for inidual wagers placed with Ladbrokes.James  has seen the largest amount of bets and money placed since the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth.It is the same name as the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s brother, James Middleton.

Last month, two 18-year-old males were arrested after a Nottingham Trent University student posted video footage of racist chants in her student halls. A black student captured two males chanting “We hate the blacks” outside her bedroom door.Members of a student law society at the University of Exeter were suspended after private WhatsApp conversations containing racist comments were shared on social media.And earlier this month, Sheffield Hallam University launched an investigation after a rotten banana was reportedly thrown at a black graduate student during an ice hockey match.On the latest figures, Mr Lammy, the former Labour higher education minister, said: “Questions clearly have to be asked about what is behind this disproportionality within the Ucas verification system, and why applications made by black students are more likely to be flagged and investigated.“The evidence suggests that unconscious bias may well be a factor.”Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, said: “This shocking practice highlights just how pervasive institutional racism is across the higher education sector. Ucas has been completely unable to justify this discriminatory practice. “Ucas must urgently investigate this and make clear what steps will be taken to end the racial profiling of students.”Fraud and similarity detection software, as well as input from universities, are used when deciding whether an application needs investigating. The process looks out for a variety of things – including fake qualifications, plagiarised personal statements and inaccurate information.Since the findings have come to light Ucas has said it will publish data, showing the gender and race of applicants flagged, to the public annually – with the first figures expected next month.The total number of applications cancelled after investigation is small. But these figures do not take into account applications that have been withdrawn by the prospective student themselves. One prospective black student told The Independent that he decided to pull out of the application process after he found Ucas’s investigation to be “intimidating”. Samuel Babarinde, who had his application flagged by Ucas during this academic year, said: “I have been very emotionally distressed by this whole process. I felt I had been singled out. “It felt like I was already guilty before being found guilty. It was intimidating and frustrating.”We need to start addressing the problem of racism in universitiesHalf of UK students have witnessed racism at university, says surveyUniversity investigates racism claims after banana thrown at graduateNUS black students officer Ilyas Nagdee said: “I am almost lost for words in being able to understand how something like that has been allowed to take place. “And how a process – which many people thought of as just being the vehicle to university applications – is also fuelling prejudice.“It will make a lot of people lose trust in Ucas, so they urgently have to take steps to rectify that. Helen Thorne, external relations director at Ucas, said: “I am not aware of any way really that unconscious bias could creep into this. Our fraud and verification team have equality and ersity training as well.”However, Ucas will be carrying out research to understand what is driving the higher figures – and the organisation expects to publish these findings in a report alongside the data.Ms Thorne added: “If it shows that there is an issue – we don’t know today whether there is an issue – then we will also set out what we will do about it.”Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The books on some of the more occult subjects piqued her interest more than boring reference books or histories and Ms Zasikowski began delving deeper into the area. When she was 18, she began reading tarot cards and learning more about astrology, magic, philosophy and occult religions. “The interest just kept gathering speed over the years and I kept branching out into different things, one of which was spell casting,” she says.Now she’s taken the hobby and made it a profession. Since 2012, she’s been casting spells for money online, helping people with marriage and cash problems through a remote service.Johnny Fox: American magician and sword-swallowerPaul Daniels: Magician and presenter who attracted up to 17m viewersPaul Daniel’s eleven most memorable and controversial quotesA single cast spell will set back the lovelorn or the unlucky Lotto players £15, while purchasers can increase the likelihood of a spell being successful by doubling or tripling up their hoodoo spell cast (for an extra £15 or £30). For those who want specialist spellwork, Ms Zasikowski can engage black magic services, which she says are more complicated and therefore powerful. They’re also more costly. “They start at £125 and go up from there.”Purchasers receive photographs of the spells being cast as evidence that they’ve been conducted. Whether the hoped for effect actually happens is up to fate.It might sound odd to some, but many do avail themselves of Ms Zasikowski’s services – “a steady stream”, she says. The witch casts between 20 and 30 spells per month, with a handful of regular customers who have been calling on her to cast spells for more than a year. It’s enough to keep Ms Zasikowski in part-time work. And while many may be sceptical that her services are doing anything more than parting the gullible from their cash, no one forces those who use her services to seek her out and pay for them.“Love is the top choice for most people, then after that the most popular things are to do with improving luck and their financial situation,” explains Ms Zasikowski. Of the lovelorn, people split into two tribes: those asking for reconciliation spells (to make a partner who has become more distant interested again) and – to use her description – “work that encourages a third party to develop deeper feelings for the person”.All the purchaser has to do is give a little detail about why they’re asking her to cast a spell, filled out through an online form. It can result in some pretty personal admissions, she says, but the relationship between a customer and a witch is similar to doctor-patient confidentiality.Hearing people pour out their hearts can be challenging for Ms Zasikowski – as can ensuring that customers recognise the kind of agreement they’ve entered. “You do get people coming to you explaining everything that’s wrong in their lives,” she admits. “My job is to respond to that in an empathetic way, but I do try and keep a boundary.“Experience taught me early on that if you don’t have any sense of boundaries, people will latch on to you,” she adds. And though she’s willing to try and help cast spells to help people with problems in their life, she’s categorically not a shrink.“Essentially the service is practical in nature,” she explains. “People pay me for the work that’s done I do the work they have the photographs to prove the work’s been done. If people talk to me about something that’s bothering them, I won’t ignore them but I’ll gently steer them in a direction to friends, a loved one, or if it’s necessary, professional advice.” There’s a pause. “I do try and keep a boundary in place.”The Welsh witch first realised she was able to cast spells when she began dabbling in the dark arts for friends or family – and on occasion, herself. “It’s a difficult one to explain, really,” she says. “It all hinges on the feedback from people that the work was done for and things that were happening in my own life.”Initially, she sold her wares (at that point mostly remote tarot readings, rather than spells) on eBay, where she sold for six years. However, in August 2012 the auction website banned the sale of a number of different “intangible” items, including “advice spells curses hexing conjuring magic prayers blessing services magic potions healing sessions work from home businesses and information wholesale lists and drop shop lists.” A petition – Don’t ban our psychics on ebay – gained nearly 2,500 signatures.“The rug was completely pulled out from under me and everyone else,” Ms Zasikowski recalls. At the same, her personal online business selling direct to customers wasn’t as built up and most of her business came through eBay. “It was a huge worry at the time.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA statue in honour of the first female Suffragette Millicent Fawcett is unveiled as Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan look on during a ceremony in Parliament Square.

(On eBay, her feedback rating had ballooned to more than 4,000.) She also introduced spell casting into her repertoire for sale, which “proved really popular”.But then much like eBay, Etsy decided that – on the basis of customer feedback – it too couldn’t allow such sales on its platform. In 2015, it closed off access to “metaphysical services”. Explaining its decision at the time, Etsy’s then director of communications told reporters that “any service that does not yield a tangible, physical item is not allowed”.Discussions among the metaphysical community of spell casters posited various reasons why they were kicked off both platforms. “The only consensus we came to was because of the nature of what we do, there’s perhaps a higher number of chargebacks, complaints and requests for refunds that earmarked our little niche as problematic.”And that certainly could be an issue. When you’re selling services and not products, it’s far easier for unscrupulous traders to muscle in. For all that there are people like Ms Zasikowski selling services honestly, and creating spells – regardless of whether they work or not – others can and will take advantage.That certainly appears to be the case when I try to speak to other spell casters. I emailed a number of them, asking if I could speak to them about their business and how they have been hounded from one site to another. Most did not respond to my emails.The Blair Witch Project TV series in the worksBut one day, in the middle of the afternoon, I got a response from one, who called herself High Priestess Moirai. “Dear Chris,” it began. “Thanks for the details and for your fast contact.”“I analysed your case very carefully and I know I can help you. In my opinion, the ideal solution is a one-week work. There are negative energies affecting your natural luck which explain why you find it so hard to get a good life. Until they’re not cleared, there are very little probabilities that you can grow in your life (in general: love, work, money, family). I’m not being rude, I’m just being honest...”I was now getting the hard sell. “Normally, it won’t take more than three months to make this spell work,” the (obviously canned) email continued.“I can increase substantially your chances to get it with a shorter and cheaper spell but if I don’t have enough time to remove the bad energies disturbing your life, it may take longer and the success rate won’t be as high.“Also, the results are permanent with the better spell so you might be able to get great opportunities more than once in a lifetime.“I’m not trying to push you whatsoever,” Ms Moirai concluded. “I’m just recommending what I believe to be the proper solution. But when it comes to choose amongst 2 spells, you’re the only one to decide. I’ll respect your choice. Any choice… Just tell me frankly if you want this spell and if you have questions to ask, go ahead.”Taken aback, I replied: “I’m not actually looking for a spell I’m looking for an interview. Is that possible?”“No dear,” she replied. “I don’t do interviews.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Generally speaking, the structure of the molecule comes from adenine binding with thymine and cytosine binding with guanine, but this is not the case with the i-motif.In order to locate the i-motifs inside human cells, the scientists designed tiny probes that could recognise the DNA knots.The probes were made using antibodies – Y-shaped molecules that bind with specific substances. In this case, the antibody was engineered so that it would attach itself to i-motifs but not to any other form of DNA.The scientists added fluorescent dyes to the antibody probes, meaning they could then monitor where exactly the i-motifs were located in the cells.New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsWhen they applied their probes to three different varieties of human cells, they identified fluorescent green spots appearing in the nucleus of each cell they looked at.“What excited us most is that we could see the green spots – the i-motifs – appearing and disappearing over time, so we know that they are forming, dissolving and forming again,” said Dr Mahdi Zeraati, whose research underpins the new paper.“We think the coming and going of the i-motifs is a clue to what they do. It seems likely that they are there to help switch genes on or off, and to affect whether a gene is actively read or not.”The researchers also think this transient nature is the reason this form of DNA has eluded scientists for so long. “It’s exciting to uncover a whole new form of DNA in cells,” said Professor Dinger. “These findings will set the stage for a whole new push to understand what this new DNA shape is really for, and whether it will impact on health and disease.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This marks a considerably higher increase than the previous financial year, when it rose by 6 per cent.Low income is the biggest single – and fastest growing – reason for referral to food banks, accounting for 28 per cent of referrals compared to 26 per cent in the previous year. Analysis of trends over time demonstrates it has significantly increased since April 2016.Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banksThe places in most need of food banks across Britain, mappedChildren are the hidden victims of Britain\u0027s food poverty crisis Being in debt also accounted for an increasing percentage of referrals – at 9 per cent of referrals up from 8 per cent in the past year. The cost of housing and utility bills are increasingly driving food bank referrals for this reason, with the proportion of referrals due to housing debt and utility bill debt increasing significantly since April 2016.The other main primary referral reasons in the past year were benefit delays (24 per cent) and benefit changes (18 per cent). Reduction in benefit value” have the fastest growth rate of all referrals made due to a benefit change, while those due to “moving to a different benefit” have also grown significantly.It comes amid growing concerns over the rollout of universal credit, which has been identified as a significant factor in the rise in food bank use.Analysis by the Trussell Trust of food banks that have been in full universal credit rollout areas for a year or more shows they saw an average increase of 52 per cent in the twelve months after the full rollout date in their area, compared to twelve months before. Food banks that are either not in full universal credit areas, or only in full rollout areas for up to three months, meanwhile showed an average increase of 13 per cent.In light of the findings, the Trussell Trust is calling for benefit levels to be uprated in line with inflation to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living, particularly for disabled people and families with dependent children who are particularly at risk of needing a food bank.It is also recommending that a requirement is placed on local authorities to deliver a “Universal Support service” to everyone who starts a universal credit claim, and asking for an urgent inquiry into poor administration within Universal Credit, so errors can be quickly resolved.Emma Revie, chief executive of the charity, said: “It’s hard to break free from hunger if there isn’t enough money coming in to cover the rising cost of absolute essentials like food and housing. For too many people staying above water is a daily struggle. It’s completely unacceptable that anyone is forced to turn to a foodbank as a result.  Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banks“Universal credit is the future of our benefits system. It’s vital we get it right,  and ensure levels of payment keep pace with the rising cost of essentials, particularly for groups of people we know are already more likely to need a foodbank - disabled people, people dealing with an illness, families with children and single parents.Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, highlighted the impact of low earnings on food bank use, saying: “Many of those who are going hungry are also working, with one-in-six households referred to foodbanks in work.Our own research found over a third of parents working full-time and earning less than the real Living Wage are now regularly skipping meals. That’s why we need to see more businesses step up, go beyond the government minimum, and commit to pay a Living Wage based on the cost of living.”A spokesperson for the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) meanwhile said: The Trussell Trust’s latest annual data return make for difficult but crucial reading.This situation cannot continue, and IFAN support the Trussell Trust’s call for benefit levels to be uprated in line with inflation to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living for the current cap on the proportion of income at which advance payments of universal credit must be repaid to be lowered and for an urgent inquiry into the administration of universal credit to tackle payment errors and delays.A DWP spokesman said: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause.“This research is based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample of less than 0.04 per cent of current universal credit claimants, whereas universal credit is working for the vast majority who claim it.  UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA statue in honour of the first female Suffragette Millicent Fawcett is unveiled as Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan look on during a ceremony in Parliament Square.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA boy walks on a pile of garbage covering a drain in New DelhiNewly ordained priests lie on the floor as Pope Francis leads a mass in Saint Peter\u0027s Basilica at the VaticanSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Male blue monkeys, she added, probably arrived later after being kicked out of their own groups on reaching sexual maturity.“I kept coming back to the idea that if they are only supposed to mate with their own kind, then why did these red-tailed monkeys mate with the blue monkeys, especially if they had males of their own species around,” Prof Detwiler said. “The female red-tailed monkeys present as willing partners and they are not coerced or forced into copulation with blue monkeys.“Apparently, some female red-tailed monkeys were attracted to novel males with different faces and welcomed the sexual advances.”The research involved analysing DNA from the faeces of the primates.Zhongzhong and HuahuaChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences         Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences    Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences              Now Prof Detwiler believes studying how the two species have co-existed and merged could help in understanding hybridisation in general.She said the society provides “an amazing laboratory in nature to help us answer many questions about how species boundaries are maintained.She added: This research is very timely because hybridization often occurs in response to environmental changes, as we are seeing with climate change and modified landscapes—it is nature\u0027s way to respond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
