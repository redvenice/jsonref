The initial vote was adjourned after it became clear that there was not sufficient support among landlords.Sir Philip and his wife Lady Green then proposed less severe rent cuts in a bid to appease the opponents of the proposals.However, the CVA remained contentious, with some landlords reported to have voted against.

We used to be able to walk along the footpath where there was just a chain link fence so you could see the lake the laurel trees in their garden.\u0027Now there\u0027s that 7ft high fence blocking our view of the garden, which is outside their boundary and is not at all in keeping with the local area. It\u0027s offensive.\u0027In a letter to the local council, neighbour Laura Lauro wrote: \u0027I strongly object to the fence it is much too high, it has been erected without permission, without consulting the people living in the area very obstructively on the footpath, narrowing it considerably and with no consideration for the historic value of the footpath and completely ignoring the gloomy effect it has on it.\u0027Another resident, Julia Russell, added: \u0027The new fence has blighted the landscape. Most importantly, it narrows and darkens the footpath to such an extent that children and dogs are at risk from cyclists suddenly appearing from around the bend.\u0027In another letter of objection, neighbours known only as Mr and Mrs Aubury wrote: \u0027Whilst we fully understand the applicant\u0027s desire for privacy, the fence as it stands negatively affects the view from our property.              The row centres on a 130ft-long wooden fence (pictured) erected next to a footpath that runs along the side of Burton\u0027s home which ramblers say narrows the path and blocks out light         The wooden fence, erected in September, next to the Thames (pictured) has replaced a chain link fence to keep out prying eyes of walkers using the path and looking into the garden          The new fence at the property was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later and now been granted despite protests by the local council         The grand property (pictured) was once owned by Bonham Carter\u0027s ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, where he lived until his death in 1932 \u0027This fence materially affects the character and appearance of this part of the conservation area. The fence has replaced a previously green meshed wire fence which blended with its surroundings and effectively demarcated the boundary.\u0027While another neighbour added: \u0027I used to be able to walk along the path with my friend side-by-side but now one of us has to walk behind the other.\u0027The path narrows as it bends round and you can find yourself quite close to the banks of the river.\u0027The fence was put up last year to protect the owner\u0027s privacy and prevent walkers using the footpath that runs alongside the house from looking into the garden.It was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later.And despite complaints from ramblers and neighbours to the property planning permission has now been granted.They also conceded that although the new fence had been built in front of the old one and reduced the width of the footpath, there was no legally-recorded width for the path.Case officer Kerry Street said in her report: \u0027Given the distance of the fence to the nearest properties, and the river that separates them, there will be no detrimental harm to these properties through either loss of light, overlooking or over-shadowing.         Bonham Carter 54, and Burton were together for 13 years before they split. The actress is now dating toy boy Rye Dag Holmboe who is 32, pictured looking loved up in London\u0027s Primrose Hill\u0027Given the relatively small change in the position of the fence compared with the previous fence, and relative to the width of the path itself, officers do not consider that safety has been compromised.\u0027Edward Scissorhands filmmaker Burton, 60, bought the Grade II listed home five years after meeting actress Bonham Carter, with whom he has two children.It was on the lawns of the property that her ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, entertained Winston Churchill, Lloyd George and the Aga Khan.And it was on the backwater of the Thames, that Asquith, known as \u0027The Sledgehammer\u0027, found escape from weighty pre-war politics, and where he mourned the death on the Somme of his son, Raymond.Asquith, prime minister from 1908 to 1916 and the leader of the last Liberal government, bought the 18th century Mill House along with neighbouring Wharf Mill, where he lived, in 1912.Asquith so loved the area - his biographer Roy Jenkins said it played a \u0027great part\u0027 in his life - that he chose to die there, and asked to be buried in the churchyard rather than Westminster Abbey.His widow sold the property in 1932. Its owner for 30 years before being sold to Burton, Jane Stevens, served as lady-in-waiting to the late Princess Margaret, who was also a close friend.More recently Johnny Depp is believed to have sought solace there with his friends Bonham Carter and Burton following the bitter fallout from his orce from Amber Heard.Bonham Carter and Burton split in 2014 after 13 years together. But they remain friends and both spend time at their country home with their children Billy, 15, and Nell, 11.During their time together the couple famously lived in London next door to each other in leafy Belsize Park, North London, saying that their relationship was \u0027enhanced by knowing we have our personal space to retreat to\u0027.Burton\u0027s representatives declined to comment when approached by Mail Online.A housekeeper said by neighbours to live at the period property said, \u0027no thank you\u0027 when approached by Mail Online for a comment.Diane Hamshere, who is named on the planning application, also declined to comment when approached by Mail Online. "},{"url":null,"title":"Mother one claims claims roadworks A14 ruined marriage","story":"Share this article Ms Hall said the pair tried hard to make the relationship work for a year, but the lack of sleep and \u0027constantly frayed nerves\u0027 became \u0027too much.\u0027\u0027We complained to Highways,\u0027 she claimed. \u0027The noise changed, but it would go back to how it was.

He was reluctant, but Carrie was insistent. It’s a sign of her sway over him. It’s a bit like Meghan and Harry. What Carrie wants, Carrie gets.’BANNING THE BINGESAs a bon viveur, Boris used to indulge in ‘late night binges of chorizo and cheese’.Breakfast would sometimes be ‘cold spaghetti or a chop or two, if there is some left over from my kids’ meal the night before’.In 2008, he memorably lambasted the UN for urging people to cut down on meat to help the environment.‘If they seriously believe I’m going to give up meat in the hope of reducing the temperature of the planet, they must be totally barmy,’ he railed.Carrie, however, is a passionate environmentalist who campaigns on animal rights, and is said to have supported Brexit because it would mean a possible end to live animal exports.So it’s unlikely to be a coincidence Boris is said to have become ‘pretty much vegetarian’ recently. A friend says: ‘Carrie has shown him that a healthy diet means he has more energy and more focus. He has been struck dumb by the improvement. He isn’t as tired or grumpy and gets much more done.’He’s even experimented with veganism after ‘Carrie has told him that methane gas from cows breaking wind is bad for the environment and going vegan would be good for him’. However, he lasted just three days, as he couldn’t bear life without cheese.         Carrie Symonds leaves Boris Johnson\u0027s Conservative party leadership campaign in central LondonHALF THE MAN HE USED TO BEBoris has admitted he always took pride in his ‘Hulk-like strength and the blast furnace super bellows of my lung capacity’ — but last year a doctor warned him he was tipping the scales at 16.5 stone.As he’s around 5ft 9in tall, this gave him a BMI of 35.9 — officially obese according to NHS guidelines. Within two weeks of cutting down on meat, eggs and diary, he’d lost 12lb and is continuing to shed the pounds under the watchful eye of Carrie.CUTTING BACK ON BOOZEBoris has always been open about his love of alcohol. ‘I do drink quite a lot of wine and champagne, at least a bottle a day,’ he wrote in 2005. ‘It doesn’t matter if it’s expensive or not because all wine is good.’However, friends say the new Boris now recognises that he gets more done when he’s sober.‘He used to be the sort who could easily down a bottle of wine by himself at dinner after a drink at the bar. But after giving up for three months completely, he no longer “does a bottle” and just sticks to a single glass,’ says one.Several of his advisers have given up, too, yet another a sign of how serious they are about his leadership campaign.Boris’s complexion has also vastly improved as a result, according to grooming expert Lucas Armitage: ‘His skin looks smoother and less ruddy. He may have had some light dermabrasion treatment as his forehead looks a lot less lined if you look at his before and after pictures.’PUMPING IRON, NOT POUNDING PAVEMENTSBoris has long been a keen runner with a taste for eccentric jogging outfits, including Hawaiian beach shorts and a bobble hat. He was also a keen cyclist, but while Foreign Secretary he was apparently banned from cycling over fears he was a key target for terrorists.Now with his lover’s full encouragement, Boris is back on his bike . . . and more.A friend says: ‘It’s true that we have not seen Boris running as he did, probably because it wasn’t really working for him.’Instead, Boris is said to be working out at his London home with Carrie, using weights under the possible guidance of a trainer.His hard work has paid off and he is able to fit into more flattering suits. Stylish and well cut, a source says Carrie has ‘personally kitted him out’ to her impeccable taste."},{"url":null,"title":"Post Office workers set bumper pay rise","story":"Share this article The Post Office has pledged to bring forward an increase in the fees paid to postmasters for offering customers banking from January 2020 to October this year.

The fact the minister has waded in and launched a badly-needed review into postmaster pay will hopefully end up being a big win for rural communities.’Al Cameron, interim chief executive of the Post Office, said: ‘We are committed to ensuring our postmasters receive a fair remuneration for the vital services they provide to customers.‘We announced significant increases for providing cash deposit services, which are in addition to other recent increases in banking services remuneration.

Its glass eyes, like evil snowglobes, contain bloody discs pierced by jet black holes. There’s an owl-like beak, the ears of a bat, and a widely grinning mouth full of lethal-looking teeth.When the 15th-century Spanish painter was working on this portrait of Satan in Valencia in 1468, he observed dead animals and shopped for monstrous fish. We know that Michelangelo went to markets in Florence when, as a teenager, he wanted to create a diabolical painting – that was how Renaissance artists made monsters. The mouth of Bermejo’s devil looks like an angler fish, an eater of human souls waiting patiently in the dark and the deep for prey to approach his lure.This charming devil – who also has snakeheads for elbows and wings that are part bat, part butterfly – cowers under the golden-armoured foot of an avenging angel in Bermejo’s painting Saint Michael Triumphant Over the Devil. In 1995, the National Gallery bought this confrontation between good and evil to hang in its Renaissance wing – but it’s an oddity there, a lonely stranger from 15th-century Spain among the treasures from Flanders, Italy and Germany. Now the gallery has assembled some of Bermejo’s other known works and researched his life to flesh out this prodigious talent.It’s unexpectedly impressive. Bermejo combines a spiky, raw strength with exquisite painterly finesse. Even though this is only a small selection of masterpieces in one room, it grabs you. Maybe that’s because we are drawn to extreme and troubled art that mirrors our fearful age. The Spain that shaped Bermejo was beginning a season in hell as its erse religions and identities were crushed into a new mould of Christian empire. Bermejo probably came from Córdoba, which until the 13th century was a Muslim city. Still today it is full of relics of a culturally complex medieval Spain that include not just the great mosque but a synagogue built in 1315.If Bermejo was indeed from Córdoba, he spent his first years in a city that’s a monument to cultural variety. In his lifetime, however, a militant Catholic Spain was expunging otherness. Jews were being forced to convert, and the last Muslim stronghold would fall in 1492. In the same year, all unconverted Jews were expelled from Spain. Bermejo’s wife, Gracia de Palaciano, was a Jewish convert who was punished by the Inquisition for taking part in “Jewish practices”. It is likely Bermejo himself was a converted Jew – which explains why he was once threatened with excommunication if he went off-message in a religious painting.There are traces of forbidden Judaism in a painting here of Christ rescuing Old Testament patriarchs from Limbo. This scene of the Harrowing of Hell comes from a series of small panels from the bottom layer of an altarpiece thought to have been commissioned by a Jewish convert. Bermejo shares the fears and nightmares of his paranoid age. As Christ enters the underworld, he is observed by more of those gross devils with blazing eyes and impossible bodies.In Bermejo’s Spain it was wise not only to conform, but to be seen to be conforming. In the three most imposing paintings here, the clerics and laypeople who paid for them to be made are portrayed in fervent prayer in a moving and anthropologically fascinating attempt to fuse the supernatural and everyday. In his great Desplá Pietà, two pious kneeling figures insert themselves next to the body of the dead Christ laid out tragically on Mary’s lap. The corpse is already rigid. Blood from the spear thrown at the dying man cakes on his thin leathery stomach. This moment of despair is emphasised and counterbalanced by the apocalyptic sky beyond the looming cross. It’s a promise of resurrection yet the effect is turbulent and unsettling.There was surely nothing the church could find fault with in Saint Michael Triumphant Over the Devil. The militant angel towers over his hellish adversary. With his pale, innocent face and wonderfully engineered, brightly metallic armour, this perfect Christian knight embodies the Reconquest that was purifying Spain. Yet your eye is drawn to that exotic devil whose mixture of body parts is a grinning refusal of order. Its very monstrosity is an image of a more complex reality than Saint Michael’s holy war can acknowledge. Bermejo, almost certainly born Jewish in a city of Muslim intellectuals, can see the underside of the story.His secret is safe with us. We look down, not up. Instinctively we share his sympathy for the devil.• At the National Gallery, London, until 29 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc069302c2b2414fceb112546d0a79e95d18a43/1154_1326_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76611af386ca7a9cd858e26047186ba9","title":"observer new review summer book clinic send us your questions","story":"Heading on holiday but no idea what to read?

What’s so creepy about a 1970s children’s book?So, it turns out I wasn’t the only terrified young reader. From the unnerving one-eyed ghost dog, Black Shuck, to the many gibbets pictured in its pages, Usborne’s World of the Unknown: Ghosts, out of print for more than 20 years, has inspired people from Reece Shearsmith to Nick Frost. Now a petition with more than 1,200 signatures, and a social media campaign backed by both the League of Gentlemen creator and the Hot Fuzz actor, have persuaded the eponymous children’s publisher to reissue the 1977 cult favourite just in time for this year’s Halloween.Shearsmith, who is writing a foreword for the new edition, says that the macabre contents of Ghosts had shaped his life. “Growing up in the 1970s, I was very much obsessed with horror, the supernatural and all things strange. My discovery of the Usborne World of the Unknown series in the school library came as such a blessing, seemingly targeted specifically for me and dedicated to everything I was fascinated by.” He said his later career, writing and starring in darkly comic shows such as The League of Gentlemen, Psychoville and Inside No 9, was significantly indebted to his early exposure to Ghosts.Laurence Rickard, a BBC screenwriter for the recent series Ghosts, says he had taken the book out of the library so many times as a child that eventually “they just gave it to me”.Looking at it now, I feel the thrill of remembered childhood terror. The images of Captain Kidd, Tom Colley’s skeleton in a gibbet, and the painting of the hideous one-eyed Black Shuck are bad enough, but it is the quiet matter-of-fact tone to the writing that still chills. Looking at the English village of Pluckley, which is said to be home to a dozen ghosts, the authors set out the dread facts – the hanging body of a schoolmaster, the black shape of a miller – along with photographs of the areas they are said to haunt. “There were no signs of supernatural activity when the photographer took the pictures,” the text notes, hinting (to my easily terrified childish mind at least) that it probably began minutes later. Ghosts are easy enough to dismiss in the light of day, but when they’re talked about as if they’re real – in a printed book, no less – alongside tips to help would-be spook catchers “spot” one, it sends shivers into the soul in the best, most delicious way.Usborne’s Anna Howorth, who spearheaded the campaign, says: “This was genuinely one of my favourite childhood books. It had such an impact on me as I read, reread and generally terrified myself … I had a sense that there was a cult following, and then when I heard that Reece was so influenced by it, I jumped on it. I was hopeful it would get wider support but quite surprised at how quickly it took off and just how passionate people were.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0878fb049b20055108e8d351624a16593eef6803/0_37_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1b25c2eea0cbdbc233542b3616ff094","title":"majestic wine shares rise as us hedge fund joins bidders for stores","story":"Elliott Advisors reportedly seeking to buy retailer’s 200 UK shopsShares in Majestic Wine jumped after a report that the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors has put in a bid to buy the British retailer’s 200 stores.The move would represent the latest bet on the fortunes of bricks-and-mortar retail from Elliott, after it last week bought the US bookshop chain Barnes \u0026amp Noble, which will be run alongside Waterstones, the British books chain it bought in April 2018.Majestic is considering selling all of its outlets as part of a radical shakeup of the business under its chief executive, Rowan Gormley, who is aiming to free up cash to pump into online operations under the fast-growing Naked Wines brand. Majestic Wine plc plans to eventually rebrand as Naked – although it is unclear if the Majestic brand would be retained if the stores were sold.In April it emerged that Majestic had appointed Rothschild \u0026amp Co, the investment bank, to work on options for a sale of part of the business, with an update due to be announced on Thursday. This year Gormley warned of the likelihood of store closures as part of the plans.Elliott would join the British private equity firm OpCapita and Fortress Investment Group, which is owned by Japan’s SoftBank, among the possible bidders for Majestic’s stores.Gormley founded Naked Wines in 2008. The online wine retailer was bought by Majestic in 2015 in a £70m deal. Gormley took over as Majestic’s chief executive as part of the acquisition, and he has since steadily increased the emphasis on the Naked brand.Since its acquisition by Majestic, Naked has more than doubled in size, with the company previously guiding that sales from the ision were expected to exceed £175m in the year ending in April. The company has said it has particular growth potential in the US, while it also has operations in Australia.However, the Majestic Wine retail arm continues to account for the majority of revenues for the parent company. Majestic’s retail network made sales of £263.8m in the year to April 2018. As well as the retail outlets, Majestic supplies other businesses, and owns the Lay \u0026amp Wheeler online fine wines brand.Gormley has previously said: “A transformed Majestic business does have the potential to be a long-term winner” but that “we risk not maximising the potential of Naked if we try to do both”.The retail industry is suffering from unprecedented pressure from the move to online shopping, while British consumer spending has also been weighed down by slow wage growth and Brexit uncertainty. House of Fraser, John Lewis and Poundworld are among the many British retailers which have cut back their store networks or collapsed in the last year.Yet Elliott, which managed $34bn (£27bn) in assets at the start of 2019, has staked millions on the continued success of high street stalwarts in the UK and US.Elliott’s swoop last week for Barnes \u0026amp Noble, in a deal worth $683m, took retail industry observers by surprise. Elliott has installed Richard Daunt, the Waterstones chief executive, to head both chains on either side of the Atlantic. The two chains will be operated separately.Under Elliott’s ownership Waterstones had already bought Foyles, a previously independent British rival, in another surprise deal in September.A spokeswoman for Majestic Wine declined to comment. Elliott Advisors did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2605b80d38fd69602a9d0e3924066f51e6fe0e06/0_73_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bda1b6786a67ab0752024e84c01fed6","title":"sir philip green pleads poverty to his landlords and its worked","story":"The near-billionaire’s victory suggests that retail rents still have a long way to fallSir Philip Green did it: he successfully pleaded poverty from the deck of his large motor yacht, currently moored in Sanremo. The billionaire (or thereabouts) didn’t even need to turn up in person in London to chivvy Arcadia’s landlords to accept hefty rent cuts on 194 shops. It required two attempts, but it was quite a piece of negotiation.Success is clearly good news for most of the 18,000 staff, which is why the CVA should be welcomed. But let’s not pretend that skies suddenly look sunny for Arcadia. The group has suffered years of underinvestment while Asos, Boohoo and Next have led the online charge. It’s not obvious that a £50m injection of equity into Arcadia, courtesy of Tina Green, will now be enough to provide “the very best multichannel experience”.The weather outlook for the landlords, however, looks worse. Intu, the owner of the Lakeside, Merry Hill and centre shopping centres, opposed the CVA, seemingly on the theory that Topshop, the healthiest part of Arcadia, would emerge intact whatever happened. The bulk of the rest of the landlord crew folded. Fear of administration, and thus empty shops, prevailed.It’s a point to keep in mind when the next big property company tries to argue demand for retail space is still OK and that the stock market, which has whacked the share prices of retail landlords, has overreacted.Everyone is wondering if the board of Woodford Patient Capital Trust will sack Neil Woodford as manager, as it’s entitled to do. But the question also needs to be asked the other way round: will Woodford want to continue?Remember an unusual feature about Patient Capital, an investment trust exclusively focused on small and unquoted companies: Woodford doesn’t get a regular management fee and instead signed up at launch in April 2015 to performance-only rewards.He might take the view that Patient Capital will recover the lost ground eventually. Pride might also motivate him to keep going in the world of young and unquoted companies he will clearly resent the idea that he made a colossal mistake by not sticking to his old territory of big idend-paying income stocks.But would he really continue with Patient Capital if the rest of his empire, where regular management fees are charged, emerges from the mess in vastly smaller form?If punters in the flagship Equity Income Fund pull half their money when the gates are opened, fees for Woodford are heading south. And since Woodford is now obliged to cleanse the Equity Income portfolio of its unquoted stocks, supposed synergies with Patient Capital will disappear.All in all, a parting of the ways at Patient Capital might suit both sides.Two months ago, Lance Batchelor, the chief executive of Saga, declared he had a “bold and fundamental” strategy to fix the over-50s insurance and cruise specialist. Part one of this new approach, it turns out, is his own exit. At the age of 55, he’s decided to retire.Odd as it may sound, it may be a genuine retirement, rather than a prod from the board to head to the exit, since Saga says there won’t be a payoff and Batchelor won’t actually depart until January.Even without a payoff, he should count himself lucky he’s able to make a long goodbye. Batchelor has been in charge since flotation in 2014, since when Saga’s shares have travelled from 185p to just 38p. Along the way, there have been two profit warnings, and the second, in April, came with a steep idend cut.The oddest part was Batchelor’s grumble about how Saga had been “focused overly on the short term” and needed to remember its “heritage”. He’d been in charge for half a decade at that point. Saga’s cruise ships move slowly investors might reasonably have expected more pace in the boardroom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf4d14edd919133aadb25881f2201dfb72d44be/0_11_4203_2522/master/4203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ae0df38c3fd936f508b1ad8411486b","title":"carlos ghosns former home inside tokyos notorious detention centre","story":"Short tour allowed inside Japanese prison accused of keeping suspects in conditions designed to ‘break’ them for confessions The forbidding outline of Tokyo detention centre is impossible to miss, even on a dark, wet afternoon in early June. The X-shaped building dominates the skyline of the unfashionable Kosuge neighbourhood in the city’s north-east.Aside from brief eruptions of media interest when a high-profile killer is led to the gallows, for much of the time there is little public scrutiny of its occupants – more than 1,600 inmates and about 800 staff.But in recent months, it has attracted unprecedented public attention thanks to one man: Carlos Ghosn.The former Nissan chair spent 108 days here for questioning over charges of financial misconduct and breach of trust, before being released on bail in March. He was re-arrested shortly after and spent another 21 days in Kosuge before being released on bail again in late April.His lengthy incarceration sparked international condemnation of Japan’s “hostage justice”, which allows prosecutors to hold suspects up to 23 days for each potential charge and question them without their lawyers present.But there was criticism, too, of the conditions that men, and a much smaller number of women, who like Ghosn have not been found guilty of a crime, must endure while they wait for the leaden wheels of Japan’s criminal justice system to creak into motion.Apparently stung by the negative publicity, this week the centre opened its doors to foreign journalists in an attempt to address criticism that it is part of a system that regards suspects as guilty until proven innocent.At first, Ghosn was kept in a 7.5 sq metre cell containing fold-up bedding, a toilet, a bookshelf, a low table and a sink, but he was later transferred to a larger cell with a bed, according to media reports at the time.Inmates are permitted to exercise in fenced yards for 30 minutes a day and take a two-hour nap after lunch.But for the remainder of their waking hours inside their cell, they are required to sit on the floor. The rule is designed to avoid confusing guards who, seeing a prone inmate, may incorrectly think he has fallen ill or committed suicide, according to the centre’s chief warden, Shigeru Takenaka.“The three big risks in Japanese prisons are fires, escapes and suicides,” said Tanaka. To prevent inmates from hanging themselves, items in the cells have rounded corners and the sink is operated with buttons. “Everything is designed to prevent suicide attempts.”The cells, some of which can accommodate up to six people, do not have TVs. Inmates are allowed to listen to the daytime radio news, but not until the evening. They bathe three times a week in the summer and twice in the winter. Their day begins at 7am and ends when their cell lights are dimmed, but not switched off, at 9pm.Their three daily meals of rice, soup and a small portion of meat or fish – a diet that Ghosn reportedly struggled with – are decided by nutritionists. They can write one letter a day and receive unlimited correspondence from friends and family.The tour itinerary did not include the execution chamber, where death row inmates are hanged after a brief meeting with a Buddhist priest.A year ago, one of the centre’s most infamous inmates, the doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara, was hanged here over his role in the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands fell ill.Japan has drawn criticism for the secretive nature of its death penalty, with inmates kept in solitary confinement for years and given only several hours’ notice of their executions – a practice Amnesty International condemned as “cruel, inhuman and degrading”.Takenaka declined to comment on capital punishment, and rejected criticism that suspects awaiting trial are kept in conditions more appropriate for convicted prisoners.“In terms of living conditions, I think we meet all of the proper standards – in nutrition, exercise and medical care,” he said. He declined to comment on claims, made by Ghosn’s lawyers among others, that the facility’s austere conditions were designed to “break” suspects and enable prosecutors to extract confessions.In April, Ghosn’s defence team said his second period in detention had interrupted his treatment for a chronic kidney ailment and that prosecutors were attempting to force a confession out of him during interrogations that lasted up to 14 hours a day, sometimes in the middle of the night.From the bulletproof cell windows to medical facilities that include a CT scanner and doctors working round the clock, Takenaka insisted the centre’s purpose was to enable inmates to prepare for their trials in safety.Violence between inmates was practically unheard of, he said: “They don’t have to defend themselves as they do in the west. They are protected here.“They will ultimately return to society, so we have to strike a balance. Living conditions here have to be good, but not so good that they are better than those of some people living outside.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

Parliament was offered a clear route to take back control, and it promptly handed the ball back to the government. Late Wednesday afternoon, by a margin of 309 votes to 298, MPs decided not to commandeer the parliamentary timetable in order to legislate against no deal.The first thing to stress here is that parliament has not decided to back no deal. It has not given the government carte blanche, and it certainly hasn’t resolved not to enact legislation in the future. Rather, MPs have decided, on this occasion, to reject what many saw as an opposition power-grab, and certainly what many Conservatives view as an affront to the constitution. Our all-important conventions dictate that ministers, not the opposition or backbenchers, run the legislative agenda.There were plenty of reasons MPs did not back Labour’s motion. The government (at least under the current prime minister) has not signalled its intention to leave the EU without a deal, the deadline is still four months away, and many Tory loyalists will have decided not to rock the boat. Some feared the lack of clarity in Labour’s intentions (Brexit secretary Steve Barclay duly cautioned against a “blind motion”), while the whips reassured others that this was not their last chance to prevent a crash-out. And of course, MPs will have many other opportunities to seize control of parliamentary time before we reach the precipice.Consider which MPs filed through the lobbies. Although 10 Tories did vote with Labour today, many other sympathetic remainers stayed loyal. Two former ministers who earlier this year resigned to prevent no deal, Alistair Burt and Sarah Newton, voted with the government, as did Jo Johnson, who resigned to back a new referendum. Furthermore, a few committed supporters of a people’s vote, such as Labour’s Jo Stevens and Julie Elliott, and ex-Change UK MP Angela Smith, did not record votes. This was neither a definitive victory nor the final word.There will always be numerous lines of defence against no deal. A prime minister has to want it and their cabinet has to back it. Then they must ensure they retain the confidence of the House of Commons. After that, MPs will still pursue legislative options to prevent the cliff-edge, as they did on Wednesday. The Speaker has indicated that he will allow them to do so and, if necessary, bend parliamentary rules to facilitate it. As we approach the October cut-off point, MPs may grow more assertive.And yet. Even committed optimists on the remain side have to acknowledge the dangers. No-deal Brexit remains extremely unlikely but not impossible. Some MPs will not have the bravery to vote against their own side. Recent electoral results have also spooked some Labour MPs from leave areas into hardening their Brexit support. Although only eight Labour MPs opposed their party’s motion, too many others abstained.But really all this tells us is that MPs don’t know what to do. Even Labour’s referendum-sceptics hate no deal, and not many Tory moderates find the idea of medicine shortages acceptable. At the end of a disappointing day, we are stuck in the familiar paralysis which rules out every option. The only question which really matters – whether MPs would, in the end, choose no-Brexit over no-deal – was neither asked nor answered.

If it were to be achieved, this would mark the end of Britain’s contribution to global warming, apart from the those emissions “exported” by buying products made abroad. It is undoubtedly a very good thing that her successor will not only be left with draft laws to enact, but also with raised public expectation that they do so.The climate emergency requires ministers to dispense with such political expediency. Net zero means no one will be able to emit much greenhouse gas in 30 years’ time. Ministers will have to come up with a route map to deal with the carbon-intensive sectors of transport, heating homes and businesses, and agriculture. In these bits of the economy carbon, emissions are either rising or flatlining. What is needed is a government that will balance the ecosystem, rather than obsessing with balancing its budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a807860075c8c8c08888cff7ade9b871c779dce/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a57191d808889f39b23c201b19e7e18","title":"theresa may net zero emissions target climate change","story":"The government’s pledges on climate change are too little, too late. What really matters is actionTheresa May is doing her best to grab some good headlines in the closing weeks of her premiership. Setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital, but her government’s plans are too little too late.Yes, Britain may be the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, but others have shown greater ambition. Finland committed to be carbon-neutral by 2035, Norway has a 2030 target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net-zero by 2050 and dedicate a quarter of the EU’s next budget to projects fighting climate change. Britain wasn’t among them.What really matters is action, not words. For all her claims of leadership on climate, May’s record in office has been pitiful: support for fracking (against the wishes of local communities), blocking onshore wind (the cheapest renewable energy source) and displaying unlimited enthusiasm for new roads and runways.As a result, it’s not surprising that the government’s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has repeatedly warned that the UK is not on track to meet its near-term carbon targets in the 2020s and 2030s.Legislation will only deliver what’s intended if it is watertight, and this law falls well short. For example, there was no mention of aviation or shipping in the government’s announcement, and it’s not clear if they will be included. Yet aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of UK emissions, doubling since 1990.Moreover, there is a very clear “get-out” clause after five years, giving the UK the option of abandoning the target if other countries are not taking similarly ambitious action. The justification for this is that UK industries would face unfair competition if others continued with their carbon emissions.This is wrong on two counts. It undermines business certainty, which will affect long-term investment decisions. And it fails to give the spur to the UK’s low-carbon sector. The CBI has already said some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies. This law doesn’t provide them.Using international credits allows Britain to carry on emitting greenhouse gases while offsetting those emissions by planting trees in other countries or helping pay for low-carbon energy projects. These things need to happen but they should not be instead of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, they should be in addition.The UK cannot claim credit by grabbing the low-hanging fruit of easy wins in the global south, particularly when it slows the rate of decarbonisation in Britain. If we are really serious about net-zero emissions, they must not be achieved with dodgy loopholes and cynical greenwash.I am also left with the suspicion that, for all the declarations of a climate emergency, the government’s approach is still incremental, based on making green-tinged tweaks to business as usual, in the vain hope that we will somehow creep towards our target of net-zero.We won’t. A carbon-free economy must deliver climate justice, focus on deindustrialised communities, provide good quality jobs for workers up and down the country, and support the global south. This law may give us the destination.

By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a tape-ball cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your nets giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats, and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

In the 30 years since, he’s inspired generations of young cricketersWhen Farouk Hussain first played cricket at the age of six he could only keep one eye on the game – he used the other one to watch out for trouble.Hussain and his friends would walk to a nearby factory, chalk a wicket on to its big wall, and play street cricket with a tennis ball.They had such fun, but the neighbours weren’t so keen. “We’d play for a few minutes, but then someone would come out to complain, so we’d have to leg it and wait for them to go back into their house,” he says.“We had to have one eye on the game and one eye on the doors of the local houses, so we could get away when they came out with their dogs. Quite frankly, we were petrified of those dogs.”However, during these sessions a seed was planted – and, ever since, the self-confessed “cricket anorak” has kept both eyes fixed on the sport.The 49-year-old was named 2018 Street Coach of the Year at the Chance to Shine awards ceremony at Lord’s cricket ground. It capped an inspiring journey for the man whose passion for the sport began with those impromptu games of street cricket, and who wants to ensure more children get involved in the game.The backing from partners such as NatWest is “massively important” to Chance to Shine, he says, because the children who come to his programme would be “lost” without it. “It’s given them so many experiences, and it keeps them occupied and healthy.”Hussain played in his primary school’s team and, during a local tournament, a coach spotted his talent and asked him to join Clitheroe Cricket Club.There, Hussain, a bowler, and his wicketkeeper friend formed a formidable axis. “We were like the Shane Warne and Ian Healy of the team,” smiles Hussain, remembering how the scorecards seemed to forever feature the legend: “Caught Amin, bowled Hussain.”He was the captain of the junior team, the under-11s, under-13s, the under-15s and onwards. The side he led won the County Championships and went to the north-west finals at Old Trafford in 1984.He says his coach’s impact was profound. “He was a church-goer and he instilled in us a sense of fair play and the importance of respecting the umpire’s decision.“These values went beyond cricket – they were instrumental to my development as a human being. Cricket taught me to have compassion, tolerance and a sense of fair play and respect. I try to replicate that in my Chance to Shine sessions.”He first became interested in coaching around the age of 18. Within a year he was coaching the under-18 side, while continuing to play. He renamed the youth section Clitheroe Cobras and injected energy into the venture, even creating branded clothing for the kids.He took the players on tours and launched a girls’ team in the Lancashire league. Sky Sports made a documentary about the team and awards followed. The Lancashire cricket board also noticed the buzz and introduced Hussain to Chance to Shine, the national cricket charity that works in state schools and communities across England and Wales.The charity invited Hussain to launch a programme in Blackburn, which proved to be an eye-opening experience for him. “Up until then I’d worked with white, middle-class, privileged children for 20 years,” he says.“But with Chance to Shine I began to work with kids who came from poorer backgrounds, who had less parental support, and very few opportunities. Their needs were far greater. It seemed the ideal thing for me to get my teeth into.”He now runs four projects in the Blackburn area. The main project is at Audley junior school, where he takes a “fast and furious” approach to keep the children involved and avoid them becoming bored by the “static” element of the game.There’s little chance of anyone being bored by Hussain, however – he is an electrifying man. At the Audley sessions, he dishes out high fives to the kids and celebrates successes as if the team has won the World Cup.“I try to meet them at their level and keep them enthusiastic,” he says. “I treat every child as if they are my own, and my dream is that one day they will pass their experiences with me on to their own children.”Hussain says he wants to avoid the “elitism you sometimes find in club environments” and instead aims for the guiding principle of Chance to Shine: inclusivity.“Chance to Shine has been an absolute godsend for these children,” he smiles. “I get a great buzz out of it too. When a kid catches the ball or hits the ball, and I see the look of satisfaction on their faces, it’s just priceless.”Looking ahead, he says he is dreaming up new projects and is “bubbling” with ideas. “I’m not one to sit still,” he says. We can all be thankful for that.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Since then, the design has become hugely popular with celebrities and collectors – Victoria Beckham’s collection of more than 100 Birkins, for example, is thought to be worth more than £1.5m.Bidders from 41 countries, across six continents, participated in the auction with sales of 243 lots totalling £3.4m. Creations from Karl Lagerfeld’s tenure at Chanel were in particular demand. The renowned designer died in February, following 36 years at the fashion house. A 2017 Chanel black lucite and crystal rocket ship evening bag, which had been estimated to sell for between £6,000-8,000, achieved £21,250, and a 2010 shiny amethyst alligator bag, which was given the same estimate, sold for £18,750.At the other end of the scale, a Hermès leather wristlet from 1999, which had been expected to sell for between £600-800, achieved just £375.“As awareness grows regarding the variety of pieces on the secondary market, as well as the breadth of price points, the benefits of collecting at auction become apparent,” said Rachel Koffsky, Christie’s the head of sales for handbags and accessories. “This is coupled with the awareness of sustainability, as consumers look for ways to collect and shop with a reduced impact on the environment.”Last year’s handbags and accessories sale just missed the £3m mark with sales hitting £2.9m. However, the sale of a similar Hermès crocodile Birkin, from 2008, achieved a European record for a handbag sold at auction, also selling for £162,500. The auction house again broke records last December when a rare Louis Vuitton explorer trunk from 1892 sold for £162,500.The most recent sale featured the largest number of designers, including Prada, Dior, Gucci, Delvaux, Celine, Fendi as well as trunks from designers including Louis Vuitton and Goyard.“Limited edition and rare handbags continue to capture the attention of serious collectors and savvy shoppers alike,” said Koffsky.

Not any more. This season, the sports bra is the most valued playerThe first trainers, rubber-soled shoes that made it possible to play tennis or croquet without damaging a lawn, were created in the 1860s. The sports bra, an item that for many women is just as essential to playing sport, did not exist until 1977. And – as if that gap didn’t say enough about the disparate narratives of male and female sport – that first sports bra was constructed out of two jockstraps stitched together.In 1977, jogging was a new urban fad – the following year, photographs of President Jimmy Carter snapped out for a run would be a media sensation – and Lisa Lindahl, an employee of the University of Vermont, had started running daily. “I loved it, except for the discomfort that my bouncing breasts created,” she recalled. So she and her friend Polly Palmer-Smith, a costume designer, came up with a bra with straps that were thick enough to be tight without digging, and that crossed over at the back so that they wouldn’t fall off the shoulder. The first advert for their “Jogbra” featured a photo of Lindahl and Palmer-Smith in their design, with Lindahl’s home address and phone number given for placing orders.Forty-two years later, the global sports bra market is worth an estimated £5.5bn annually. And yet even in 2019, shopping for a sports bra can serve as a sharp reminder of how unseriously female sport is taken. Soft crop tops that offer no support beyond a centimetre of elastic around the ribcage are sold alongside compression bras, as if they fulfilled the same function. Rather than facilitating physical activity, many so-called sports bras simply look sporty, by dint of wide straps and a high neckline.But perhaps, finally, things are changing. For the first time, this year’s Women’s World Cup teams have a sports bra as part of their official kit. Nike, sponsor of 14 national sides in the tournament including England, has used the seamless, nylon-dex technology of Flyknit trainers to create a Flyknit bra. The focus on the sports bra is one element of the progress being made in women’s football to create kit that is purpose-designed for female athletic excellence, rather than hand-me-down designs, scaled down. The bespoke female kits reflect not just a different physicality, but psychological difference. “Whereas our male players prefer a very fitted, almost tight fit, as it makes them feel like superheroes, our female athletes do not feel the same way,” says the Nike design spokesperson Heather Amuney-Day, so the women’s shirt is designed to sit just free of the body.In the World Cup year, women’s football style, with its punchy colours and casual silhouettes, is becoming an aspirational look in an athleisure marketplace often dominated by the black and beige of brunch-orientated athleisure. Nike’s advertising images show the bra in yellow against black, electric blue with postbox red – the clashing brights of the football field – and while some of the models wear leggings, others are in silky shorts and knee-high socks. “The look of football is strong and free it stands for confidence and pride,” says Amuney-Day. She predicts that “just as we saw the success of the US women’s team in 1999 impact a whole generation of American girls, we are seeing this happen across key cities worldwide today”.Eartha Pond started playing football aged nine. It was about five years later that “over one summer my body developed, and suddenly a sports bra was essential. Sometimes I wore two sports bras, and padding, and bandages, to be comfortable – and if I’d forgotten my bra, there was no way I could participate.” Pond played professionally for Chelsea and Arsenal before becoming a PE teacher, at which point “I really noticed the drop-off in participation among girls. I tried to take the time to find out what the barriers were for them, and sports bras came up time and time again. One girl who was studying PE for GCSE told me that her mum couldn’t afford to get her a sports bra. For other girls, the fact that the sports bra wasn’t on any uniform list meant it was difficult for them to ask for one.”As well as working to persuade brands to back subsidised access to sports bras for teenage girls in need, Pond now campaigns for sports bras to be part of a school kit list. “If you are serious about wanting every pupil to participate in sports, then you need to embed that in the practicalities,” she says. “In a class of 30 kids, eight will leave school obese. This is important.”The practical significance of investing in sports bra development is clear to anyone who has tried to exercise in a bad bra. But there is a cultural significance to the sports bra, too. Here is a garment that honours the female body - honours breasts, no less - in a non-sexual, non-objectified way. When Reebok uses Nasa-inspired technology in its PureMove sports bra and Nike partners with Loughborough University for biomechanical testing of female bodies in motion, it sends a message about how we look at women’s bodies. It marks a step change from the position Victoria’s Secret took on sports bras when it entered the market in 2013 with a product specifically designed to give women cleavage at the gym – “The uniboob problem, where your sports bra makes you look straight across – no one likes that”, the then CEO Sharen Turney said at the time. To Pond, “a sports bra is about reducing movement. As an athlete, it’s in a similar category to a shin pad. I don’t think it should be sexualised.” She makes a link between raising the profile of the sports bra and acknowledging the impact of the menstrual cycle on female athletes. “In the past, we’ve been quite naive – we haven’t talked about female-specific issues in sport.” Were the world to get more comfortable talking about physical issues that affect excellence in female athletics, that might have a positive impact on the world beyond sport.When the American professional footballer Brandi Chastain celebrated scoring the winning penalty in the 1999 Women’s World Cup by taking off her shirt and whipping it over her head, she was criticised for drawing attention away from the tournament and on to her body. A sports bra in plain sight was considered unladylike, or unseemly. Chastain said afterward that she didn’t plan to take her shirt off – “I had zero real thoughtful seconds when that happened,” she told USA Today – but that the image brings her “joy” when she sees it now. A few years ago she framed the bra and hung it on a wall. “I look at it every day because I walk past it in my house,” she said. “I don’t sit there and contemplate it as often as I probably should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e065a41239ae50d2fdf639ee02e924ec1dc8b5/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0231bf9cdcea1c9a9217149774ad20e9","title":"soulcycle uk 24 pound spin classes london","story":"US fans include Oprah and Michelle Obama. Expect an ‘inspirational’ experience, low lights, tears – and amethyst crystalsThere is a place on Sunset Boulevard where Oprah Winfrey celebrated her 60th birthday and Lady Gaga her 26th. The sound system is state of the art, the room is always packed, the lighting a dusky flicker of grapefruit-scented candle. The atmosphere, according to Oprah, is “spiritual”. But there is no dancefloor, and no bar, just 55 exercise bikes screwed down in tight rows. This is SoulCycle, where you come to pedal your way to happiness.There are 91 SoulCycle studios, all in North America, with a 92nd about to open in London, and they are to this fitness-obsessed decade what designer boutiques were to the 00s. They each have their A-list fans (Michelle Obama and the first daughters were regulars at the Washington branch of SoulCycle during their White House years). They have waiting lists (the most popular classes involve hovering over a screen to secure your place). And if you are lucky enough to outwit the list, you can expect to pay £24 for a session. Still, as status symbols go, it is cheaper than a Hermès Birkin.An obsession with fitness, fetishised by a complex hierachy of waiting-list-only classes, heavily merched and served up with a side order of mild fantasy role-play, is one of the quirks of modern urban life. You can pay £22 for a class at Barry’s Bootcamp in London or Manchester and get shouted at while you do your press-ups, just like Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman. You can join a barre class, twist your hair into a bun and relive your childhood Royal Ballet School dreams in a dance studio as your turnout is corrected for the umpteenth time.SoulCycle, which opens its new UK studio on Friday, ratchets up the concept of fitness-as-transcendental-experience. Every SoulCycle studio is home to a large amethyst crystal, placed next to the instructor’s bike to help dispel negative energy.“We view what we do here as a live production,” says Melanie Whelan, CEO, over a mango, banana and turmeric smoothie from the studio’s inhouse Good Life cafe. “And it happens on the hour, every hour. The curtain goes down on one class, and it goes up on the next. We want check-in to feel a little bit frenetic. We want the class to be physical, musical, emotional and inspirational. We want everything, from the dry shampoo in the locker rooms to the retail, to be part of the experience.”Whelan presents in the emotionally keyed-up pitch of SoulCycle. In place of a CEO’s suit, she wears a long floral skirt, a “LOVE” slogan T-shirt, a charm necklace with her kids’ initials, and white trainers. So intense is the SoulCycle experience, it is not uncommon, she says, for people to find themselves crying. “It could be that you haven’t given yourself permission to think about something in a long time and then something about that experience, in the dark, lets it all out.”The “science” of SoulCycle is based on somatic coaching, “which means breaking you down physically in order to build you up mentally,” says Whelan. “Your instructor is a voiceover telling you that you can push through this, that you can overcome this. Those words are being said about the bike, but we can take them with us outside. What we find is that the words the instructors are sharing in the room are mantras that we as riders are taking out into the world. We are training our emotional health, as well as our physical health.”The first-person plural gets used a lot at SoulCycle. It can sound a lot like a cult or a clique, I suggest Whelan shrugs and flashes back: “We prefer to think of it as a community.” The lockers are deliberately narrow, creating spaces “designed for natural collisions. The community starts on the bikes, and then you have all these people funnelling out into the lobbies, shoulder to shoulder, and that’s where people connect.” The rhythm of the day works like a Hogwarts sorting hat, channelling like-minded people together. “People gravitate to classes with the instructor who represents something about them – their kind of music, their preferred tone of communication. And so there’s a like-minded element to the people in your particular class. Also, there are different communities around different times of day. Six am is our Rooster time slot: very type A, in and out very fast. Later in the mornings you get freelancers, moms. And then in the evening, it’s the millennials who come here instead of going to a bar.” The ersity of these communities is, of course, limited to those blessed with money, free time, physical ability and the confidence to join this glossiest of cliques. For all the talk of crystals and communities, SoulCycle is a finely tuned and aspirational experience. What the bikes themselves lack in visual appeal (one reason for the dim lighting, you imagine) is made up for in the locker rooms, where marble-tiled showers are stocked with boutique hotel luxury: bergamot-scented Le Labo shampoo, Drunk Elephant jelly cleanser. There are Dyson hairdryers and peonies on the bleached-wood beauty stations. The lobby is lined with rails of the SoulCycle-branded leggings that Victoria Beckham wears to class when she is in Los Angeles. (SoulCycle’s many celebrity devotees are another reason for the dim lighting. When Beyoncé takes classes at the West Hollywood studio, she slips in after the lights have gone down.) Audience enthusiasm is harnessed and curated as social media content. A recent post on the brand’s official account repurposed a rider comment – “I think SoulCycle is the first ‘safe space’ I’ve ever actually been in” – as an inspirational quote, framed in an Instagram square against SoulCycle’s trademark shade of yellow.Marketing only works when it speaks to a need in us – even if that need isn’t, in essence, anything to do with indoor cycling. When Whelan left Virgin America 13 years ago to join Equinox, the upscale New York gym company that went on to buy SoulCycle a few years later, she says: “My parents were like, really? You were working for an airline and now you’re going to work for a gym?” Whelan, it turns out, was ahead of a curve that has seen fitness move up to the fast lane of culture. Fitness has come to stand for being happy, being successful. For discipline and hard work, and for being your “best self”. This is a potent cocktail of positivity – endorphins plus a holistic understanding that fitness can be about more than burning calories – plus existential angst. The more we sense the robots gaining on us in the inside lane, the more urgently we feel the need to be faster, stronger, more disciplined. The instructors – “the talent”, as Whelan calls them – become mini-gurus in their studios. “The inspirational coaching aspect is what we scout for when we’re casting for instructors,” says Whelan. “It’s a lot easier to teach someone how to count down backwards from eight than it is to teach them how to actively inspire a room full of people.”Whelan and her team have been researching London for two years in preparation for this launch. “We’ve been finding out when the school drop-off is, what time people get coffee, where the train stations are. We need to really understand, anthropologically, how this community functions. Every place has its nuance.” For instance, there may not be as much whooping and hollering in the London studio as happens in West Hollywood. But “one thing we hear everywhere we go”, says Whelan, “is that riders just love to have 45 minutes where they don’t check their phone”. In a world where technology has flattened work and life into a neverending to-do list that oozes out of your phone like toothpaste, a sign inside each locker reminds you that there are no exceptions to the no-phones rule in class. (“If you are a doctor or your child is sick, kindly leave your phone with the front desk and we will get you if there is an emergency.”) Just below the no-phone notice, every locker has a USB port, so that you can charge your phone while you are in class. The research shows, says Whelan, that it’s what the people want."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cbfa0931b957077fbb36bbe2018328ad5b96f3e/0_209_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da3eaaa802d983a53516a2c3375fbe4c 660w","title":"spice girls animated movie","story":"All five original band members are set to lend their voices to a film that will feature original singles and new songsAn animated Spice Girls movie is in the works at Paramount.

Perhaps it was a whisker too early for the fresh beans required, perhaps the dish was just too rustic for the restaurants of the Côte d’Azur, but it made me sad, because, as the American gourmand Waverley Root observed, it’s one of the finest soups known to man.Much like the Italian minestrone, but with its own Gallic peculiarities, it’s the perfect way to showcase the season’s freshest produce. Properly speaking, pistou is the sauce that goes with the soup – closely related, as we shall see, to the more familiar pesto, but with its very own complement of controversies to navigate.In her forthcoming book Provence (Octopus), my friend Caroline Craig describes soupe au pistou, her great aunt Edmée’s department at home, as “a celebration and symphony of summer vegetables”. And, frankly, I couldn’t put it better myself.Unusually, perhaps, given that this is a vegetable soup, many recipes are fairly laissez-faire when it comes to what to use – provided, as Craig makes clear, “they’re harvested at their optimum sweetness”. Indeed, Root reports that his cook, who hails from Fréjus and “makes the best pistou I have ever tasted”, says that “it does not matter what vegetables you put in pistou, as long as there are plenty of them”.Jacques Médecin, the colourful (to put it politely) former mayor of Nice, a convicted criminal and defender of apartheid, courts rather less controversy with the claim in his more palatable cookbook, Cuisine Niçoise, that “there are three absolute musts: tomatoes, courgettes and fresh haricot beans”. (Michel Roux, however, prefers peas and broad beans to haricot, for reasons best known to himself. That said, Roux also refers to it as a minestrone au pistou – but then he is from Saône-et-Loire, which is a long way from Nice).I try squash – according to Richard Olney, the shops in Provence “carry a number of large, tough-skinned yellow, orange or red-fleshed squashes, all sold in slices or wedges for use in soap au pistou”. Luckily, so does my local greengrocer, along with peas, potatoes, carrots, turnips, leeks, celery, green and runner beans and swiss chard. I conclude that all are happy additions – though the chard tops, in particular, do have a tendency to look rather unappetising after so long in the pan, so I’d stick them in with the pasta, if they’re what floats your boat.Médecin’s courgettes and tomatoes seem a pleasingly summery combination at this time of year, the latter gifting the broth just a hint of acidity, rather than taking centre stage, while carrot adds sweetness, and runner beans a pleasantly robust texture. Whatever vegetables you go for, take a tip from chef Alex Jackson’s new book Sardine, and make sure everything, with the exception of delicate leaves, is soft before you add the liquid: “If you don’t cook the vegetables for long enough at this stage,” he writes, “the soup will lack body and the vegetables will retain an unwanted crunch.”Though this is a summer dish, it’s perfectly possible to make it in winter, too: Roux suggests using “more root and seasonal vegetables, such as celeriac, jerusalem artichokes, kale etc” instead.White beans are the most common in the recipes I try, but borlotti are also used by Craig and others – I find some dried ones in the eastern European section of my local supermarket, and in the healthfood shop, too. Use whichever you prefer, or a mixture, though I’d advise cooking them separately, because they’re likely to soften at different rates.You could use tinned beans in extremis, but, even though I’m not averse to a shortcut, I find all the ones I try a little bit mushy, even before reheating.I’m surprised to discover that both Peyraud, and Gedda and Moine, make their soups with a meat base. Peyraud adds a lamb shank to the pan, “whose soft flavour and gelatine reinforce the velvety quality drawn from the squash and the shell beans” Olney reports her as saying “the lamb shank is there only for flavour and texture. With family, I leave it in the soup and anyone who wants to eat the meat can have it when I have guests, I remove the meat from the bone, cut it into small pieces, and return it to the soup.”Gedda and Moine go for a ham hock instead, which gives their soup a powerfully salty, smoky flavour more like a ham soup than a vegetable one. My testers and I think the sweetness of the lamb works better with the earthy flavour of the beans, in particular, but all of us prefer the simpler soups that allow the vegetables to shine.Roux’s fat-free broth, which starts by infusing water with onion, herbs and spices, before adding the rest of the vegetables to the pan, proves beautifully clear, but lacks the richness of recipes such as Craig’s, where the onion base is slowly and patiently cooked down in olive oil until soft and golden, giving the finished broth a delicious richness. This, as well as being careful not to over-dilute the flavours, seems to me to be the secret of a really good soupe au pistou Jackson describes the desired end result of his recipe as “quite thick, although there will be enough well-flavoured broth to make the dish feel soupy”.Though you could serve the soup with bread instead, pasta makes it a proper meal in a bowl. Macaroni is the most popular option, though Médecin insists that only broken up vermicelli will do, while Craig says any small pasta will work, or indeed a mixture of large and small pieces, if you prefer. I also try rice, and find that works very well, if that’s what you happen to have to hand – don’t worry, Médecin died in 2011, so he won’t find out.Though it’s important to season what M le Maire dubs an “extraordinarily subtle” broth well – Peyraud also calls for a casual “handful” of coarse sea salt – I don’t think it needs the cayenne pepper, cloves or bouquet garni some recipes stick in for me, it should be a deliberately blank canvas for the pistou.As the name suggests, this has much in common with pesto, being basil-based, though it generally contains far more garlic and no pine nuts (unless you’re Michel Roux, of course, who can get away with anything in my book). A simple recipe, yet I end up with six very different sauces – Gedda and Moines call for six garlic cloves to two large handfuls of basil, for example, and Jackson for a mere sixth of a clove for about the same amount of leaves. Feel free to adjust to suit your own tastes (and your plans for the rest of the day). British wimp that I am, I find just one clove powerful enough for me.Peyraud, who also stirs the pistou into the soup itself, doesn’t use cheese, preferring to heap it on top afterwards, but we all decide we prefer it pesto-style – and that salty parmesan works better than the sweeter gruyère or mimolette recommended as an alternative in some recipes. This is a sauce that should pack some punch.Many Provençal cooks add fresh tomato as well, which is, of course, never found in green pesto. As with the soup, this seems to be more for acidity than flavour, so I think it less faff to use a squeeze of lemon, as Craig suggests alongside her tomato. It also keeps the colour pleasingly bright and vibrant.Médecin’s recipe for pistou is almost as long as his recipe for soup, and contains many warnings against using mechanical means to make life easier for yourself, including the plea to “avoid using hand-operated or electric garlic crushers, as they separate the pulp from the juice, thus spoiling the taste of the garlic. It is encouraging to note those noblest of utensils, pestle and mortar, have recovered their rightful place in the modern kitchen.” Loth as I am to agree with him, I do: unless you’re making a vast quantity of pistou, the texture of the pounded sort is far better than the one I make in the food processor. Don’t ask me why, but it’s true. Up to you, though.What does matter, however, is, as Root puts it, that “into this rich mixture of a thick liquid crowded with vegetables you put the pistou … at the very last moment”. This could be stirred in, but I prefer to serve it dolloped on top, which is probably enough to get me chased out of Nice. I’ve got the recipe now, though, so who cares?150g dried white or borlotti beans (or 450g fresh)1 garlic clove, peeled and squashed with the flat of a knife1 bay leaf2 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 pinch fresh thyme leaves 1 large tomato1 carrot, peeled and diced2 courgettes, diced150g runner or green beans, topped, tailed and cut into roughly 2cm lengths50g small macaroni, vermicelli or other pasta, snapped into smaller pieces if longSalt and pepperFor the pistou1 garlic clove, peeled 1 pinch coarse salt50g basil leaves 20g finely grated parmesan60ml extra-virgin olive oilSoak the dried beans in plenty of cold water for about eight hours, then drain and put in a large saucepan with squashed garlic clove and bay leaf, and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, skim, then simmer for about an hour, or until tender but not falling apart, topping up the water as required, then leave to cool in the cooking water.Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then fry the onion for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme, and fry gently for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put the tomato in a small bowl of boiling water for a minute, then peel. After 10 minutes, squash the tomato into the pan using your hands, then fry for 10 minutes.Stir in the carrot and courgettes, and fry for 20 minutes, stirring regularly, until soft but not mushy, then add the cooked (or fresh) beans and any of their remaining cooking water (they’ll soak most of it up). Top up with just enough cold water to cover the vegetables and bring to a boil.Simmer for five minutes, then add the pasta and simmer gently until cooked.Meanwhile, in a mortar, mash the garlic with a pinch of coarse salt to a smooth paste, then gradually pound in the basil leaves. Using a fork, whisk in the cheese and then the oil.Season the soup to taste, then ide between bowls and top each serving with a generous dollop of pistou.• Soupe au pistou is a Provençal classic: how do you make yours?

Absolutely not. When you respect your opponent you don’t all of a sudden sit back and try not to score. This is the World Cup and all you can do is play with heart, with passion, and with intensity. Doing that is showing the opposition respect.The 13-0 victory over Thailand on Tuesday was a comprehensive performance from the Americans. Every player looked fit. Every player looked like she had technical ability. They played as a team. They were good on set pieces. They looked like they were having fun. I loved seeing Rose Lavelle, Tobin Heath, and Kelley O’Hara combine so well. Alex Morgan displayed what a great player she can be.It was tough for me to watch some of the US goal celebrations – which have come under criticism – considering the scoreline. You do want the game to be celebrated and you do want to see players having fun but at the same time I thought some of the celebrations were a little overboard. A few seemed planned out and I do know some players spend a lot of time thinking about celebrations for the fans. It’s not always necessary. We haven’t won the World Cup yet. My favorite celebrations capture the rawness of the moment and are filled with spontaneous emotion. When that happens you actually see how much passion there is in the sport and how much pride the players have.That said, one of the classiest things I saw was Carli Lloyd going directly to Sukanya Chor Charoenying, Thailand’s goalkeeper, after the game. Carli put her arm around her and supported her as they walked off the field. Thirteen goals on a goalkeeper has to be incredibly tough. As a goalkeeper, I don’t know how you deal with that many goals. I’ve had five scored past me and that was a heavy blow. I never wanted to feel that way again and it took me a long time to get over it. It is something that I have never forgotten.I would love to give some advice on how to deal with it but really you just have to suffer. Struggle helps us grow in life and soccer is similar. You have to feel the pain and find a way to get through it. Unfortunately, you have to go through it yourself. The goalkeeper is on her own. I hate to say that but it doesn’t matter what anyone says to you and it doesn’t matter who tries to comfort you. Goalkeepers have to deal with it ourselves. It does take time. It is hard and it is painful and we have to face it.I felt bad for the Thailand team in general, especially when I saw some players physically dejected and actually give up. That’s not good. By the end of the game they had nothing left and that was hard to see. The difference between the US and Thailand - who made the Asian Cup semi-finals just last year - is complicated and like the chicken and the egg. Do you open up the World Cup to grow the game? Or do you grow the game and then open up the World Cup? I think you have to first invest in the women’s game before you get to the World Cup but unfortunately that’s not what a lot of the federations around the world have done or do.So what did we learn about the US from the game? We already knew that we can score goals and that we have a variety of ways to score goals. We already knew how skilled these inidual players are. We did learn that the young players managed any nerves very well and that they can be fun to watch. The younger players certainly got their feet wet and got some World Cup experience. That will help them going into the next match against Chile.But what we still don’t know is if the US have a sound defense when they get tested. What we need to know is if some of these big name players – who did do really well against Thailand – can do it against the better teams. This American side is the best attacking team in the world, inidually. I want to see all the players perform as they did against Thailand when it really matters and it really counts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32185b3b4b48737b4ab2e6090bb8283237c417dd/0_420_5487_3292/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d830169340189d9e1fe99d424950169e","title":"france v norway womens world cup live","story":"Here’s tonight’s match report from Suzanne Wrack in Nice ...A controversial VAR penalty means France are on the brink of qualifying from Group A. They’ve got six points from their first two games and only need a point to be sure when they face Nigeria on Monday. Norway, who play South Korea in their final game, are level with Nigeria on three points. That’s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.That’s your lot!90 min+1: Boe Risa makes way for Maanum. There will be four added minutes.90 min: “The penalty was not harsh,” Jan Schreuder says. “It was wrong. The Norwegian player hit the ball. The French player was late. That’s why she was hit. She should have stepped out. Mistakes can be made but this decision is ridiculous after watching the VAR. I have no skin in the game except that I’m in favor of the VAR and this makes it look ridiculous.”88 min: Cascarino wriggles into the area from the right, but her cross eludes everyone.85 min: Gauvin makes way for Cascarino.80 min: There’s widespread agreement that the France penalty was very harsh. That’s probably correct, though I was convinced they were going to get it as soon as the referee went to check on the screen.78 min: “After watching that VAR outcome I have vowed NEVER to watch another match,” Stephen Scriven says.77 min: Utland replaces Saevik for Norway.74 min: I doubt the former Wales assistant manager is enjoying his evening.After a long wait Le Sommer keeps her nerve and drills a low penalty into the right corner. Hjelmseth goes the right way but she’s beaten by the pace and accuracy.71 min: It was unintentional but Engen did catch Torrent and France are awarded a VAR penalty. Norway are fuming.70 min: It may well have been a foul by Engen, who caught Torrent on the thigh with a wild swing, though she did take the ball first.69 min: VAR! VAR! VAR! They’re checking for a penalty for France after a possible foul on Torrent. It might have been a foul by Engen.68 min: There are a few whistles from the crowd. There’s annoyance at Norwegian timewasting. “In the Germany-Spain match earlier today, a Spanish player became mysteriously indecisive in her own six yard box, contributing to Germany’s winner,” Peter Oh says. “Now a French star has contrived another bizarre scene in the small area. It’s turning out to be Six Yard Box Twilight Zone day.”66 min: Fight! Fight! Fight! “I wonder if Mr. Lilley actually read my comment?” Alan Kirkup says. “I was at Old Trafford when Denis Law scored for Man City (a nice backheel) to send United down. I suggest he searches for the video. Class has no gender.”64 min: That own-goal’s taken the wind out of France’s sails. “To answer the question, how much is enough?” David Farrelly says. “Football could do with an injection of mathematics, in much the same way that the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method is used in ODI cricket. A simple gaussian (normal distribution) could be used whose peak is the current average number of goals scored (in, say, a league or competition) and whose width is defined using the standard deviation. Depending on where the current match is on the distribution the level of celebration could be labelled as “over the top”, “peak”, and “muted” with possible sub-categories.”61 min: Good of them to tag her in the tweet. 58 min: Renard means “fox” in French. It was a real Francis Jeffers of a finish.57 min: France break with Thiney leading the charge. Her pass is deflected into the path of Gauvin, who curls straight at Hjelmseth from 18 yards.This is an absolute Djimi Traore from Renard. Hervolsen breaks down the left and rolls a cross into the six-yard box. Unfortunately no Norway attacker’s there. Luckily Renard is. The France defender carefully taps the ball into the bottom corner from six yards out. What a finish. You can’t be too careful in those positions.53 min: Henry dances down the left, but her cross is headed over by Gauvin.52 min: “Seriously, Mr. Kirkup?” Jeffrey Lilley says. “No one worries about lopsided results in the men’s game. As long as goal differential is one of the tiebreakers, expect teams to score all they can. If the game is to henceforth be about “sportsmanship” and not hurting your opponent’s feelings, then I propose the game be played until the first goal is scored. So if a team scores in minute 1, so be it. If they score in minute 47, 88, or 120, so be it. Penalty kicks would be handled as normal after 2 extras. That way, the scoreline is always 1-0 or 0-0 (Team X on penalties) so everyone looks good and no one gets sad. In all seriousness? They’re all professionals. They can deal with a lopsided loss. Don’t try to put kiddie game rules into a professional competition, and don’t criticize the women when you don’t criticize the men.”51 min: There’s been little response from Norway yet.48 min: “Thirteen goals,” Joshua Reynolds says. “It does make me wonder what number should the celebrations have stopped. Would the receive stick if they had just stoically walked back after scoring the fifth goal? The eighth? Where exactly is this line where you are celebrating too much?” Le Sommer feeds Majri on the left. She takes no time at all to whip in a cross and Gauvin is more alert than Thorisdottir, allowing her to sweep a low shot past Hjelmseth. Gauvin, who’s had some problems off the pitch, is delighted.That didn’t take long!46 min: Norway get the second half underway.And...Neither goalkeeper has had to make a serious save. See you in 15 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Through the Pioneering Bradford Lasses campaign, more streets and public spaces in the city will be named after women in order to correct the gender imbalance of the figures whose achievements are publicly honoured. Bradford will kick off by naming a new street – Lillian Armitage Close – after a local suffragette who campaigned for women’s right to vote.I am under no illusion that more brown faces on bank notes, more women’s names on blue plaques or the toppling of the statues of colonialists we continue to celebrate will actually see minorities getting better-paid jobs, an increase in women climbing the ranks or somehow end white supremacy. I do, however, think that these can be brilliant and necessary moves. It is important that a city, town or country acknowledges not just the existence but the contributions of those who helped make it great.The historical achievements of women, minorities and particularly minority women have been too easily and intentionally erased. Some campaigners have taken matters into their own hands and put up their own blue plaques. This has been met with ire and hostility in some quarters. One piece in the Spectator, for example, feared “a tide of over-commemorated celebs who don’t deserve ceramic or even metallic immortality” if a spate of “fake plaques” continued. The expectation seems to be that those who have been written out of history should patiently wait for the process to stop, rather than take action. But this gatekeeping doesn’t preserve history – it actually makes it more ahistorical.In Norwich, handmade signs were created and mounted to pay tribute to the work of influential local women. An organisation called Rosie’s Plaques claimed responsibility, tweeting that, out of the 300 plaques celebrating places, people and events in Norwich, only 25 are for women. “Our fine city deserves better.”I would argue that Amy Winehouse has done more for the current culture of Camden Town than Henry Doughty of Doughty Street, the landlord of the area when the eponymous street was built in the 18th century. We could do with an Olive Morris Street in Brixton, named after the activist and co-founder of the Brixton Black Women’s Group, who died aged 27. A Kate Moss Close in Croydon and Naomi Campbell Mews in Streatham have a certain ring to them, too. None of these changes solve racism or sexism, of course, but they don’t need to solve everything to be necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0d29dd19e74a1ca1f66b737548465bf9e641da/12_118_2815_1688/master/2815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=295dc27414c68a838ca48cb0965bef22","title":"weatherwatch winnipegs worst storm relegated to a footnote","story":"Cars were blown across the street and roofs were ripped off buildings but a general strike stole the headlinesOn 15 June 1919, the city of Winnipeg in Canada was struck by the most powerful storm in its history, with winds reaching over 84mph.

Although news reports described the event as a hurricane or a cyclone, this was neither, just an unusually powerful summer storm.That June was a notably hot one in Winnipeg. It was 3C above average, and extremely humid. Such conditions carry large amounts of moisture to high altitude, and are ideal for storm formation. A major storm was no surprise, but few could have expected miles of telephone and power lines to be brought down and power plants damaged. The unprecedented wind tore the roofs off several buildings, including a children’s hospital.Parked cars tumbled over and were blown across Main Street.

So it’s now a question of politics – specifically whether a PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit can command and sustain the confidence of the House of Commons.”Johnson officially launched his campaign on Wednesday saying he believed a new government “with a new mandate, a new optimism, a new determination” could leave the EU with an amended deal by 31 October.However, the leadership frontrunner warned that he was determined to leave the EU by that date, whether he had achieved a new deal or not.“I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome, I don’t think we can end up with any such thing. But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously,” he said.Johnson refused to say what he would do if he had not secured an improved deal in time for 31 October – or whether he would resign if the deadline were not met or no deal was prevented.Speaking after the defeat in the Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would continues its cross-party efforts to stop no deal.“Labour stands ready to use whatever mechanism it can to protect jobs, the economy and communities from the disastrous consequences of a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “Any Tory leadership candidate should know that parliament will continue to fight against no deal.”Eight Labour MPs including Caroline Flint, John Mann and Graham Stringer voted with the government against the motion and 13 more abstained. Ten Conservative MPs voted with Labour.The debate before the vote revealed fraying tempers in all wings of both parties. The Labour MP Gareth Snell, who represents the leave-voting seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central, said he regretted not voting for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement. He said he would abstain because he could not countenance parliamentary manoeuvres that would lead to a further delay.“We will have been responsible for a no-deal Brexit by default because of our inability to make a decision,” Snell said.The former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he was prepared to resign the Conservative whip and go against the government in a no-confidence vote if it would prevent a no-deal Brexit. “I simply have to say, here and now, I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted,” he said.The motion proposed giving MPs control of the parliamentary agenda in a fortnight’s time. That day could then have been used to begin legislation to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, though it is uncertain what form this would take.Speaking in the debate, Starmer said MPs had been forced to act because of suggestions from leadership candidates including Johnson and Dominic Raab that the UK would leave – come what may – on 31 October. Raab had even suggested he would be prepared to prorogue parliament to stop MPs’ efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit.“It will introduce a safety valve in the Brexit process and it will be a reminder to all Conservative leadership candidates that this house will take every step necessary to prevent a no deal,” Starmer said.The motion, which Labour tabled during an opposition day debate, was signed by the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said it was a “blind motion” that gave no indication as to what path MPs would try to pursue to block a no-deal departure, and would have “virtually unlimited scope”.Tory MPs who said they intended to back the plan included Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach, Sam Gyimah and Jonathan Djanogly, plus Boles, who had flown back to the UK specifically to vote on the motion.MPs working across parties believed it was essential to try to start efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit before the next prime minister was installed and prior to the start of the summer recess. There are no further opposition day debates scheduled.Tory leadership candidates including Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart, who have opposed no deal, had earlier made it clear they would not back the motion.But Hancock told the : “It’s no good just having a Brexit position that is built on either re-running the old plan, which failed or threatening no deal, when parliament has voted in the past already to block no deal. No deal isn’t a policy choice that is available to the next prime minister.”Earlier, Philip Hammond said Johnson’s Brexit plan was impossible as the UK will not be able to leave the EU with a deal or without a deal by the end of October.Hammond cast doubt on the viability of the Brexit promises of Johnson and other Tory leadership contenders as he gave a speech in Westminster.He said many of the candidates were pledging things that they could not deliver. Asked whether Johnson’s plan to leave on 31 October would work, he said: “I don’t think so … I think it’s not sensible for candidates to box themselves into a corner on this. Parliament will not allow a no-deal exit from the EU and our experience has suggested it may not be that easy to secure a deal in parliament.”The idea of leaving with a deal by that date would be “very difficult or impossible”, he said.Leadership contender Jeremy Hunt was also asked about Hammond’s comments and said: “This is a time for skilled negotiation and not empty threats. I’ve always wanted to keep no deal on the table as one of our negotiating levers but we can’t be blind to the fact that there is a strong majority in parliament against no deal and it’s likely that parliament would find a way to block no deal if that was being pursued by the prime minister.“That’s why we need to find a way through this that gets us a deal. And if we want Brexit we need to choose a prime minister who can get us a deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

New street signs were unveiled outside the Nasa offices on E Street in Washington.Nasa is preparing to celebrate next month’s 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission and first moon landing. All 12 people who walked on the moon were white American men.Cruz, who pushed for the name change after going to see the film with his mother, wife and daughters, told the : “I think it’s important to recognise everybody’s contributions. Women and men across every racial and ethnic line have contributed to this incredible journey we’re on and I think it is also vitally important that we send the message to little girls and little boys that there is no limit to what you can accomplish.”Cruz, whose mother was a mathematician at the Smithsonian Institution in the 1950s, added: “The extraordinary achievements of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson and Dr Christine Darden, who’s with us today, prior to the book and the movie had not been told. Very few people knew those stories, and yet those are stories that can and do inspire and we should be telling stories like that a lot more often.”The movie adaptation of Hidden Figures, which starred Janelle Monáe, Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer and received three Oscar nominations, showed the struggle of African American women for equality at Nasa during the era of Jim Crow laws.In the 1950s, mathematicians were known as “computers” and African Americans were known as “coloured computers”. African American women in Nasa’s computing pool were separated from their white colleagues even as they calculated trajectories for missions involving Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth.The renaming followed legislation floated last year by both the US Senate and Washington DC council. The local law was passed unanimously in December. In February, Nasa renamed a facility in Fairmont, West Virginia, after Johnson, now 100 years old. In 2015, Barack Obama awarded her the presidential medal of freedom, America’s highest civilian honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

Meet the independent groups from Devon to London who are seizing controlA quiet revolution has begun in the Devon town of Buckfastleigh. Its compact high street, functional-looking industrial estate and population of 3,300 suggest a place modestly getting on with business. But, while it may go unnoticed by those whooshing past on the A38, or tourists at nearby Buckfast Abbey, there is something happening in Buckfastleigh.That something is a radical reinvention of the way that power works at a local level, based on a kind of politics that has nothing to do with the traditional party system. And it is authored not in a Whitehall ministry, but in towns, villages and neighbourhoods – where it is having a real impact on some of the services people most care about.Pam Barrett is a 50-year-old civil servant who has lived in the town for 12 years and talks with a mixture of breathless passion and fearsome expertise. Her political biography begins with the local outdoor pool and park, for which she managed to bring in about £300,000 of outside funding – including big donations from Sport England. Saving the pool from closure – and upgrading it and the park – may sound like the most local of issues, but it broadens into a story centred on one key subject: 10 years of cuts, and what austerity has done to a town with high levels of what politicians call social exclusion.“It felt to me as if we had a properly depressed town,” she says. “The carpet factory here had closed, and loads of people had lost their jobs. All our services were cut. Our buses have been hacked right back and the fares are through the roof. And when the district council said it was going to close the pool, the town council’s view was just: ‘Oh gosh – there goes another thing.’“I was furious that we were left here with nothing. It takes an anger to do what we have done.”Promising to make the council more open and inclusive, and to concentrate on solving the town’s problems, nine BIG candidates were elected, meaning they gained control of the council. They increased the local council tax precept (the small share of council tax that goes to town and parish councils), so people in the highest council-tax band paid nearly £2 a week. And they built up an impressive list of achievements: a new Citizens Advice bureau on Friday mornings, floodlights for the football pitch, a new “town ranger” (“Kind of an outdoor caretaker,” says Barrett) and a school-holiday activity service for local young people called Hello Summer – all things woven into people’s everyday lives.To make all this possible, they made huge changes to the way the town council operates. For a start, its activities are chronicled on Facebook. People who are not elected councillors are free to join in with the monthly agenda at council meetings. “For the first time, we are able to say: ‘We have this amount of money and this is where it goes,’” says the councillor Andy Stokes, who is also Buckfastleigh’s mayor.Barrett also has plans to widen the bounds of what the council can do. Similar new political groupings have materialised in a handful of nearby towns and villages. This, she says, will lead to sharing resources, so that vitally important but expensive services – health and safety provisions or child protection – can be shared. She thinks that would open the way to a model of running everything from youth services to buses.Buckfastleigh is not alone. This kind of local uprising has started to occur all over the country. At the May local elections in England, one of the most noticeable changes was the huge increase in the number of independent councillors elected to local authorities, whose numbers increased nearly threefold. Tangled up in that is the proliferation of organised groups, such as BIG, that reject traditional party labels and seek control of the lowest tier of government – town and parish councils – where creative possibilities have tended to be lost in a sea of protocol and tradition.Councils at this very local level may be associated with parks, allotments, bus shelters and litter bins. But, thanks to the Localism Act 2011, they can – in theory, at least – do whatever they like, within the limits of the law.Many of the people inspired by this growing mood of local assertiveness are looking to one town that stands as the crucible of this new movement: Frome, in Somerset (my adopted home town), where a group called Independents for Frome took power in 2011, kicking out the Tories and Liberal Democrats to take all 17 seats on the town council. The group has since introduced a new town hall, a publicly funded food bank, electric charge points for cars and a vehicle-sharing scheme. The group’s modus operandi was turned into a manual for radically changing communities, written by the council’s one-time leader Peter Macfadyen, and titled Flatpack Democracy. Some 4,500 copies have been distributed a sequel will be published this year.Macfadyen reckons there are between 15 and 20 town and parish councils being run along the lines of the Frome model, “with a non-confrontational way of working and a participatory approach to democracy”. They include a large number in the south-west, places in Yorkshire and County Durham, and even New Zealand. Another 20 similar groupings, he says, have taken seats, but are yet to assume local power.Why does he think the idea is spreading so fast? “Every other system of so-called democracy is now totally dysfunctional and non-representative,” he says. “And with Brexit, and what’s happening in central government, that is bound to have an impact downwards people thinking: ‘My voice is not being heard in any way.’”Down the road from Buckfastleigh is Dartmouth, a picturesque place on the Dart estuary, which attracts thousands of tourists. But beyond the half-timbered buildings clustered around the harbour is a community laid low by cuts, whose problems are worsened by the fact that Dartmouth is too big to be a village, but not sizeable enough to merit many of its own public services.In May’s town council elections, 11 of its 16 seats were won by the new Dartmouth Initiative Group (DIG). Its most vocal representative is Dawn Shepherd, who moved there from Wolverhampton 15 years ago. Her journey to public office began when she started the local food bank. “There’s a lot of poverty here,” she says. “And, on top of that, where we are is like an island. We have no jobcentre, so it is £6 each time on the bus. Having to go somewhere else for everything adds to the poverty.”The new political grouping was mentored by Pam Barrett from Buckfastleigh. “We didn’t understand how the process worked. The only access we had was going to the council meetings and having 15 minutes to put questions to the mayor,” says Shepherd. “Pam told us that we could make a difference nothing was set in stone. We could run the council.”While the makeup of the old town council was disproportionately male, 10 of DIG’s candidates were women. This ersity extends to the group’s mixture of party politics. As with all the independents I meet, they insist that orthodox party ides have no relevance to politics at the most local level. “If you look at our 16 candidates, we have got leftwing people and we have got a supporter of the Brexit party,” says another DIG councillor, Ged Yardy. “We have not been elected on the basis of our previous politics. Party politics is not in the room.”It would be easy to think of the new wave of independently run town and parish councils as something of a non-urban trend – but there is at least one shining exception. Queen’s Park in west London sits on the outer edge of the City of Westminster, and has a population of about 13,000. Almost a decade ago, a group of residents began to work towards making their area the first part of London to have a parish council in 80 years.Two years later, their idea won a local referendum – and, in 2014, the first elections for its 12 seats were held. Although insiders are quick to point out that starting a council from scratch has hardly been a breeze, the informal grouping of people (none of whom has a party label) now in charge of an annual budget of about £150,000 have an array of achievements to their name. They include funding a youth centre blighted by cuts, bringing a disused park back into use, starting new annual festivals and creating a befriending project to support isolated and lonely older people.Ray Lancashire, 54, has been a Queen’s Park councillor for just over a year. Since the age of 10, he has lived on the Mozart estate, where any ideas of the city of Westminster being synonymous with wealth and privilege give way to a much more complex reality. His path to holding public office was defined by his work on air pollution, which local surveys have found to be well above legal limits.Westminster council, he says, tends to understand pollution in terms of “main roads and trunk roads”, rather than “areas that don’t have high traffic, but are still really affected”. (The council says that it focuses air quality monitoring on “roads that we know are pollution hotspots, as this has the biggest knock-on effect”.) Queen’s Park’s grassroots councillors are now doing in-depth pollution studies, blazing a trail for temporary car-free “play streets” and pushing the authorities to take drastic action. “We are at ground level,” he says. “We’re passionate about our environment and we know what the issues are, and how to sort the problems out. And we’re enthusiastic. That’s why our council is important.”Perhaps the most unlikely example of the new local democracy is in Alderley Edge in Cheshire. The de facto capital of the north-west’s footballer belt – at various times, the home of Posh and Becks, Cristiano Ronaldo and Peter Crouch – is a remarkably affluent place: on the day I visit, the Barnardo’s charity shop is selling a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes for £150, while Marie Curie has an Alexander McQueen dress for £200. Local people regularly complain about super-rich football stars parking on double yellow lines because they think that the fines are chump change. But recently, even here there were rising complaints about the state of the public realm.These complaints led to the rise of Alderley Edge First, whose tagline is “people before party”. On a hot Tuesday afternoon, I meet three of their prime movers in the local Caffè Nero: Mike Dudley-Jones, Geoff Hall and Rachael Grantham, whose family has run a grocery business here going back five generations. “When you came to Alderley Edge not so long ago,” says Dudley-Jones, “it was shaky at the edges: weeds in the pavement the whole thing just looked run down. A one-horse town. And there was no one saying: ‘It doesn’t need to be like this.’”Alderley is traditionally, solidly Tory – its MP is the Tory leadership hopeful Esther McVey. Until 2015, the Conservatives held all nine seats on its parish council, most of which had long been uncontested. But that May, a near miracle happened. Alderley Edge First won every single one. Since then, its councillors have radically upgraded the local park, completed work on the village’s trouble-plagued new health centre, saved allotments the old parish council wanted to turn into a car park, kept the local library open for an extra afternoon every week and made good on their pledge to spruce up the place – self-watering flower installations pepper the main street.When I mention party politics, all three members bristle. “It’s so irrelevant at this level,” says Grantham. “For me, it’s a realisation that normal people want to make a difference in their areas. There is a real feeling of people saying: ‘We can make a real difference in our patch.’ That is snowballing.”Four years ago, as well as aiming at control of the parish council, Alderley Edge First also put up a candidate for Cheshire East council, the big local authority until recently run by the Tories, and dogged by allegations of misconduct, some of which are being investigated by the police. Against formidable odds, Craig Browne – who also sits on the parish council – beat the Tories after being re-elected a month ago, he became Cheshire East’s deputy leader. Something very striking, he says, now lurks among the champagne, expensive shoes and international hotshots: a revived sense of community spirit. “It was always there, but it was latent,” he says. “What we have done is encourage it. If people see councillors who are prepared to get their hands dirty, they think: ‘If they’re doing it, I’ll do it as well.’ That has been the biggest change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd75e882e68665274292c08fa6c1590dc8a840d/0_209_5391_3236/master/5391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80fa9a054f29f9b0ee05f4b4a460f087","title":"sheffield council backs universal basic income trial","story":"City moves closer to hosting pilot of ‘radical’ scheme Labour has vowed to trial if in powerSheffield has moved closer to becoming one of the first UK cities to trial universal basic income after the council formally lent its support to the idea.Last month, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, confirmed a Labour government would pilot UBI if it won a general election, identifying Liverpool and Sheffield as potential areas for pilot schemes.The plan would do away with the need for welfare as every citizen would be given a fixed sum to cover the basics, whether they are rich or poor, in work or unemployed.On Wednesday, senior city councillors agreed to work to ensure a UBI “can be implemented successfully in Sheffield”.The politicians were persuaded by a detailed proposal put forward by UBI Lab Sheffield, a grassroots group of researchers and activists. They estimate a pilot involving 4,000 people would cost between £18m and £60m, depending on the extent of the scheme.Julie Dore, the leader of the Labour-controlled council, said she recognised the transformative effect UBI could have on the residents of Sheffield, particularly given increasing automation in the workplace.“UBI has the potential to be a bold, radical change to how our economy and society works with benefits for people’s wellbeing and how we support people in need,” she said. “In order to face up to these realities, I think it is completely right that radical solutions are considered.“As a council, we are getting behind this and committing to looking at this further and working with a Labour government in trialling this.”Sam Walby, a co-founder of UBI Lab Sheffield, said: “It’s an idea whose time has come. It seems to have been included in a lot of new visions, whether that’s for politicians or political writers.“There seems to be a common theme that’s running through, which is, ‘how do we reimagine the welfare state for the 21st century?’“We’re not saying this is a silver bullet that could solve everything, but we need to be exploring it. Some of its results might be completely surprising and unexpected.”The cost of any future Sheffield pilot would be met entirely by an external funder, likely a national government, and not Sheffield city council, UBI Lab Sheffield said.McDonnell confirmed earlier this year that such funding could come from a future Labour government.“I would like Liverpool – of course I would, I’m a Scouser – but Sheffield have really worked hard. I’ve been involved in their anti-poverty campaign and they’ve done a lot round the real living wage,” he said.Olivia Blake, the deputy leader of Sheffield city council, said she had invited McDonnell up to the city to “discuss these radical proposals further”.Jason Leman, the chair of UBI Lab Sheffield, said the city was uniquely predisposed to hold a pilot due to its geography.“It’s like a collection of towns, it isn’t a monolithic city. Every city has its neighbourhoods but Sheffield is particularly ided. There’s a real disparity between the north-east and the south-west in terms of wealth, life expectancy and life experience,” he said. “Within Sheffield’s districts, you have communities that are almost self-supporting.”UBI Lab will attempt to gather the support of organisations across the city, including both universities, the local NHS branch and small businesses, encouraging them to sign a pledge of support for the pilot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9e811e0a7293d263bf3e4c2a1debd9fc23a13a/0_60_3001_1801/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82218b5c45eeb8ec484549ec4841e7b4","title":"andy murray hopes singles this year tennis unlikely to be us open no timescale","story":"• Murray returns to doubles action next week after hip surgery• ‘It’s baby steps just now, but I hope to play singles this year’Andy Murray has given his biggest hint yet that he may once again compete at the top of his sport, after the three‑times grand slam champion admitted he hoped to return to singles competition before the end of the year.After he made an emotional address to the Australian Open crowd following his first-round defeat against Roberto Bautista Agut in January, many thought Murray had played his last match of any kind. Four months after undergoing surgery on his right hip however, the Scot says he is largely pain free. He will compete alongside Feliciano López in the doubles competition at Queen’s Club next week and, provided there are no setbacks, at Wimbledon in July.While Murray remains cautious about putting a date on it, a full return to the sport is now also in the offing. “It’s baby steps just now,” he said. “I’m feeling good, pretty much pain free and enjoying training, practising, improving all the time just now.“I don’t think when Wimbledon finishes that I will just step on to the singles court the following week and everything’s good. I still have quite a lot of work to do before I’m at a level where I feel like I’ll be able to be competitive.“At this moment I’ve been progressing all of the time, at some stage it’s probably going to plateau for a while before I’m able to kick on. I hope at some stage this year I would be able to get back to playing singles again. When that is, I’m not really interested in putting a time limit on because I’m quite happy just now so I don’t need to play singles after Wimbledon or the US Open. If I can, that would be brilliant, but I don’t think that’s going to be the case. I think it’s going to take a bit longer.”One player who underwent the same hip resurfacing surgery as Murray was the doubles player Bob Bryan. He returned to competition five months after his operation but has described a return to singles competition as “a different monster”. Murray says he has yet to test his recovery with any singles practice matches, though he has been hitting with the American Frances Tiafoe in training.Murray was speaking at an event to announce a new partnership with Amazon. The online giant is set to provide a £60,000 grant to two young British tennis players, with Murray chairing a selection panel that will select the winners, one boy and one girl. “It’s important to help develop young talent in this country and the transition from juniors to seniors isn’t easy,” Murray said.Amazon also announced that it has secured the rights to stream WTA tournament matches on its Prime subscription service. The company says it will be able to show up to 2,000 women’s matches from a minimum of 49 tournaments each year, in an agreement that runs for four years from 2020.The news marks a further expansion of Amazon’s interest in sports broadcasting, with tennis at the centre of its strategy. Entering into the one major sports rights market not already dominated by Sky or BT Sport, Amazon now has the rights to show not only the women’s tour but also 37 ATP Tour events, the US Open and the Queen’s Club tournament next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c154ef1b40973cef80542acbc9245f6c8b9bc06/0_48_4488_2692/master/4488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296aa499a66a5ca35bf6f0384bd1cc38","title":"chris froome team ineos tour de france cycling","story":"Losing the four-times winner is a blow but it leaves Geraint Thomas as the team’s clear leader for the Tour de FranceTo seal the destiny of the 2019 Tour de France, the organisers have devised a final week with some of the toughest climbing ever seen in the race’s history. It is highly likely, however, that the defining moment may turn out to be Chris Froome’s horrendous accident on Wednesday while warming up for a time trial, which has stymied his attempt to win a fifth Tour before he even glimpsed the starting blocks.That is not to belittle Froome’s erstwhile fellow competitors, least of all the defending champion, Geraint Thomas. A multiple Tour winner is a key reference point in every Tour he rides, who weighs heavily on the racing each day, even when, as last year, a teammate ends up heading seamlessly for the win.A Tour without Froome will resemble the 1983 race, when Bernard Hinault was ruled out by tendinitis, or the 1976 race, when Eddy Merckx was sidelined by a saddle boil, or 1997, when Miguel Indurain was absent for the first time in a dozen years. A Tour without Froome for the first time since 2012 will be different. Not better, not worse, just different.Team Sky’s catenaccio style of clamping down the racing has not pleased everyone and the squad’s PR has been disastrous at times but Froome’s consummate determination and no holds barred style have forged some memorable moments: most notably in 2016, when in the space of a few days he could be seen first flying down the Col de Peyresourde in a dramatic crouch, then fighting crosswinds in the Midi with Thomas and Peter Sagan, and finally running up Mont Ventoux after breaking his bike.The leader of what are now Team Ineos has been here before he is not nicknamed “Crash” Froome for nothing. Last year his Tour was doomed from the start by a minor get-down in the first stage.His 2014 attempt at retaining the title was wrecked by a fall in northern France in the rain, the only time in seven attempts he has not finished the race. A 2015 bid for the Vuelta a España was shelved when he crashed in Andorra. Even by the standards of a sport where everyone falls off at some time, and the only question is about the severity of the prang, Dave Brailsford’s proteges seem to fall off their bikes more than most.Thomas, who will take over from Froome as the team’s Tour leader, has been even more unfortunate over the years, although he denies being accident prone.There have been other heavy non-racing crashes for Ineos riders already this year: Ben Swift’s fall while training in Tenerife, which ruined his early season, and the crash in Colombia that put Egan Bernal out of the Giro d’Italia. But Froome is now 34 this year he was bidding to become the fourth oldest Tour winner in history. Given his age, this crash may mean he ends his career stuck on a spectacular but nonetheless frustrating four Tours.As to where this leaves his team, one of Brailsford’s catchy phrases is “mission clarity”, which the former GB cycling performance director views as a prerequisite when trying to land a major target. No one would have wished for the decision to be made this way but racing without Froome will remove the question that has been lurking since the Welshman triumphed last year: which of the two Tour winners would be leader this time?Starting with two leaders in form, one going for the record fifth win and the other desperate to prove he is not a one-Tour wonder, had the potential to become tricky, no matter how ardent the protestations of mutual regard, affection and support. As Thomas described in his autobiography, at times Team Sky’s management struggled to come to terms with his new-found status even as he rode to victory last year.As it stands, Brailsford and co can reflect that while they are appallingly unlucky to lose Froome in this way, what seemed like another piece of dire misfortune – Bernal’s crash on 4 May – may have had a silver lining in the medium term. At least that has ensured that, even with Froome sidelined, Thomas will go to the Tour with one of the finest prospects in cycling to support him.For Froome this will be a bitter blow and all cycling will wish him fair wind for a speedy recovery, perhaps this September in time to bid for a second Vuelta win or victory at the world championships in Yorkshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11aa271e24e3b6b882bb33dc6508b5b903c1734b/0_358_6500_3900/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86862756b23d3a9a9e902c642b1a2921","title":"megan mccann case bet 365 discontinued","story":"• Megan McCann placed a £25,000 stake on 12 horses in 2016• Bet365 claimed student’s bet breached its terms and conditionsThe long-running legal case in which Megan McCann, a student from Northern Ireland, was suing the bookmaker Bet365 for £1m in unpaid winnings has been discontinued shortly before it was due to return to court in Belfast, prompting speculation Bet365 has agreed to a settlement over the disputed bets almost three years after they were placed in June 2016.A Bet365 account in the name of McCann, who was a 19-year-old student at the time, placed a stake of almost £25,000 on 12 horses running in races at Bath, Kempton Park and Naas on 22 June 2016. Bet365 accepted the bets – a combined total of 960 £13 each-way Lucky 15s – which were mostly successful and returned a total payout of £984,833.However, Bet365 refused to pay the winnings, claiming the original stake for the bets had been provided by a third party in contravention of the firm’s terms and conditions. It also refused to refund the £25,000 stake.McCann launched a legal action against Bet365 two years ago and the latest in a series of court dates working towards a full hearing of the case was scheduled for Friday morning.However, the listing was removed earlier this week and an administrator at Belfast’s high court confirmed on Wednesday that McCann’s legal team had lodged an official “notice of discontinuance” in the case.While punters who have followed the case will be pleased if it transpires that some or all of the £1m winnings have been paid, the news it will not reach a full hearing could also leave a lingering sense of frustration that significant questions about the robustness of a major bookmaker’s T\u0026ampCs will not be tested in court.McCann’s statement of claim alleged Bet365 and other leading online bookmakers habitually engage in “unconscionable practices” when dealing with their customers, and that they actively discriminate against shrewd punters who are able to make their betting pay. Many successful punters find it almost impossible to get their bets accepted and their accounts are either closed or, more usually, restricted to stakes of £1 or less. As a result, some are known to resort to using “clean” accounts opened by family members, friends and acquaintances to place stakes on their behalf.Bet365 did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e07467269663b431ef76de59398976b6d5a3b92e/0_169_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9deb86eea5bca5cc4bdcba681a1af84a","title":"one night in miami review nottingham playhouse muhammad ali malcolm x and sam cooke","story":"Nottingham PlayhousePitch-perfect performances enliven Kemp Powers’ impressive play, punchily debating racial tensions in 1960s AmericaThe night he beat Sonny Liston in 1964 to become world heavyweight champion, Cassius Clay, soon to re-identify religiously and politically as Muhammad Ali, goes a few punchy rounds of debate in a Miami motel room with the Muslim preacher Malcolm X, the soul singer Sam Cooke and American football player Jim Brown.In this 2013 play by Kemp Powers, enterprisingly revived in Nottingham three years after it had its UK premiere at London’s Donmar, the four African American leaders in their fields box ideologically about whether racism is best countered through cooperative assimilation or radical opposition.The 95-minute multi-biographical anecdote is given extra heft by knowledge of what followed. The beautiful, amusing, vibrant fighter – tremendously embodied by Conor Glean – will become the increasingly angry and ailing Ali of later years. And, within 12 months of this meeting, both Malcolm X and Cooke had been murdered, the tensions of 60s America suggested by the activist checking the hotel suite for bugs. In a clever feint from the writer, the one punch thrown does not come from Ali.Christopher Colquhoun’s Malcolm is a convincing mix of piety, menace and insecurity (including, in the boldest dramatic stroke, doubts regarding his skin colour). The play is hard to cast because it requires a lead who can do a pitch-perfect impersonation of Cooke’s singing, while holding his own in complex four-way dialogues, but Matt Henry, as he did in Kinky Boots, catches the eye and ear in every moment. As Brown, the least-famous and least-written of the main roles, Miles Yekinni is convincingly a black celebrity who has opted to pretend America is simpler and better than it is.The text still seems as impressive as at the Donmar in 2016, though weakened by director Matthew Xia’s peculiar decision to stick in an interval after 58 pages of 75. This interruption leaves the dramatic climax as a skimpy PS. Five-star acting gets only three-star presentation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd85d31e6346bb7909b005fb78272e80b1d5ca04/0_199_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c59ac9dc50d79d2537113e5136abc6a","title":"a caring sharing top gear it actually just might work","story":"Hosts Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris have toned down the ‘bantz’ in favour of hugs and heartfelt moments. Early signs suggest it might be an improvementThe new series of Top Gear debuts on Sunday, and you get the impression that its timing was no accident. You see, this is not just Top Gear, but Top Gear presented by a new lineup of Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris. The whole thing seems like Jacamo incarnate like an airport Wetherspoons, like every Ocean Colour Scene CD melted down and formed into a statue of Keith Lemon. Happy Father’s Day everyone!But don’t get too excited, because even more change is afoot. Believe the new hosts and it is not merely the personnel that has changed, but the entire emotional profile of the show. As McGuinness told the  earlier this week, Top Gear 2019 will contain “hugs and nice bits”, because “that’s the way the world is now”. This Top Gear cares. This Top Gear shares. This Top Gear is very keen to reassure you that it isn’t going to flip out and punch a producer in the face for not providing it with a steak.And these threats are backed up by the first episode, which deliberately goes out of its way to undercut any misapprehensions you might have had about the new cast. Tasked with driving around Ethiopia, it doesn’t take long for McGuinness to turn to camera and reflect sincerely upon the nature of famine. A few seconds later, Flintoff takes the time to apologise for being a “knobhead” in his youth. The trio console each other on their mutual failure to pass their driving tests first time around. And, crucially, they all stop and help each other whenever one of them breaks down. That sound you can hear is Jeremy Clarkson struggling to turn in his grave.Because that isn’t what Top Gear is about, is it? Top Gear was designed to be a showcase for brittle male friendship the sort of friendship that looks to all of the world like outright hatred. Addressing each other by surname only. Refusing to offer help at any cost. Generally behaving like shaved apes dunked in Lynx. That is the Top Gear way. It’s a bloody blokey show about blokey blokeness, not a social-justice demonstration. Whatever next, a segment called Patient Discussions Of Intersectional Feminism In A Reasonably Priced Car?But calm down. It hasn’t turned into Woke Gear just yet. It turns out that McGuinness was only discussing emotional maturity relative to the Jeremy Clarkson era. And in that context, it makes perfect sense. The heartfelt moments I mentioned earlier are still quite rare. The rest of the show is still an overload of slightly forced megabantz, only now it doesn’t come in the form of gay jokes and xenophobia. And that’s a decent enough start.There is plenty to build on here. Finally, after years of flailing about, this new lineup feels right. The hosts are a happy mixture of enthusiastic and nebbish. They are people you’ve heard of, but not people so famous that they’ll abandon the show on a whim because they’ve already got more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes. They appear to rely a lot less on scripted material in the field, too, so they feel like actual human beings and not just the outsized double-take machine that Richard Hammond became some time around 2007. It’s fine. Top Gear is fine now, which is a huge improvement on the last five or six years.Plus, happily, everyone sticks to their strengths. Episode one is a long travelogue with a review in the middle. That’s it. There is no cloying celebrity interview, no thuddingly provocative “news” segment. It almost doesn’t need to have a studio element at all. Perhaps it would be a better show if it didn’t.The car show landscape has basically disintegrated of late. The Grand Tour staggers on in reduced form on Amazon, with Jeremy Clarkson seemingly switching his focus to agriculture. And, until now, Top Gear has been content to slide into irrelevance. Nobody cares about it any more, so why not mess with the formula a little? And if change comes in the form of a little hugging and sincerity, that can’t really be a bad thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaee9b291fe4ef9ee38b9f5c353e6e66ea5a0b3a/5_285_6482_3889/master/6482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=128385f09430e21a536e38e078ff1553","title":"the archers june spencer i was a cockney when i started in ambridge","story":"She started out on three guineas a week and ended up one of radio’s most loved voices – not to mention a dead ringer for another grande dameWith a week to go to her 100th birthday, the cards are flooding into June Spencer’s immaculate Surrey bungalow. The Archers’ scriptwriters have given her their own gift: a top secret plot bombshell, to be detonated on her birthday this Friday, which will push the young whippersnapper Peggy Woolley (yet to turn 95) to the forefront of the serial once again.It means a heavier than usual workload for Spencer, who gestures gamely towards a pile of scripts waiting to be marked up and rehearsed. Having played Peggy since 1951 – apart from a brief career break to settle in her two children – she knows the character better than anyone, so is she allowed to make tweaks? “I read them aloud so I’m aware of any word that doesn’t ring true. Sometimes if it gets a bit grandiose I change it,” she says.Those occasional grandiosities are the result of scriptwriters who were not even born when Peggy made her entrance, and who are therefore not always aware of the social nuances of her background, she explains. “I think they see her as an extremely rich socialite, but she arrived in Ambridge as a Londoner. She was more or less a cockney, a town girl who needed to have everything explained to her.” In other words (which posh Peggy would not appreciate being spoken aloud), she was a handy device for a programme conceived as a way of giving information to farmers who needed to keep up with a rapidly modernising agriculture in order to feed the growing British population after the second world war. “We were told it was not a drama: it was real life overheard. We were virtually fake actualities,” jokes Spencer.Initially, Spencer doubled as Peggy and a flighty Irish baker’s assistant called Rita, briefly adding a Scottish maid to her repertoire, which in one episode involved introducing herself into a room in two different accents. Like Peggy, she betrays little of her origins. She is poised and elegant, with more than a passing resemblance to the Queen (“Yes,” she sighs, “people do say I look like her, particularly abroad”). She grew up a beloved only child in Nottingham, where her father travelled around on a bicycle as a salesman for a biscuit company. She caught the entertaining bug early, and when the “talkies” began, started to speak with an American accent, alarming her parents who sent her off for elocution lessons with a woman who introduced her to poetry and Shakespeare. “She was also the producer of the very busy amateur dramatic theatre in Nottingham and when I was about 15 she said, ‘I think you might like to join the society to get some experience.’”She was on holiday in Eastbourne with her mother when the Germans invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and recalls her father driving across country to take them home “because the trains were full of little evacuees”. On her 21st birthday the Nazis marched into Paris. She had made herself a dress for a party in a local hall. “There were 42 of my friends there, including all my boyfriends, and so I danced with each of them in turn,” she recalled in her autobiography, published in 2010. “I knew it was probably the last time we should all be together as they would soon be joining the forces.”One of her guests was “a fair-haired blue-eyed boy with a cheeky grin” called Roger Brocksom, who “always seemed to be around”. He was serving in Northern Ireland when the couple married in 1942, but a few months later was posted to India and Burma. “I simply went on living with my parents. It was three years and four months before we saw each other again,” she wrote. “By then he was a major and my life had completely changed.”Her first big break came when the local repertory theatre was casting around for someone to play a 12-year-old. Reluctantly, because she was well into her 20s, the theatre manager entrusted the role to her, rewarding her success with a contract to play in weekly rep, two shows a day, for three guineas a week. It was to be the first of many child roles for Spencer, who says: “Even today if I just close my eyes I can be any age I’ve ever been. I know the feel of it, the atmosphere.”The arrangement broke down after she demanded a pay rise for taking the title role in a Christmas production of Alice in Wonderland and her boss made the mistake of suggesting that she should be grateful for being spared war work. “I drew myself up to my full 63 and a half inches and said ‘I’d rather fill shells than work for you’.” She marched off to the labour exchange and landed a day job as a “hello girl”, staffing the telephone switchboards, while volunteering in morale-raising shows for the forces in her spare time. “We had a repertoire of two plays and away we would go in a cranky old bus with our scenery stashed down the centre aisle.”In 1943, she passed an audition for the BBC’s Midland region and became a stalwart of the radio repertory company, knocking around with several of the actors who would go on to join her in The Archers. A children’s radio pantomime introduced her to the two men who would play Peggy’s second husband, the entrepreneurial Brummie Jack Woolley: Philip Garston-Jones (who played Woolley from 1962 to 1980) was the dame, while Arnold Peters (1980 to Jack’s death in 2014) doubled as the hero and villain of the piece. “I, of course, played the princess.”Her storyline with Peters was to prove one of the most taxing of her career after Jack Woolley developed Alzheimer’s. Spencer’s own husband, Roger, had recently died after suffering from the disease. “They asked both of us if we were happy to take it on and we said yes. It opened up a whole new life for me because the Alzheimer’s Society approved and invited me to speak.” She went on to become a patron of Alzheimer’s Research UK, “because I felt it was something that needed to be brought into the open”.In the end, though, Jack Woolley outlived the actor who had played him for so long that Spencer suggested it was time to kill him off. Her final scene was a long monologue where she went through all the pictures of their life together. Was it hard to do? “You do feel a certain sadness,” she says, but just as Peggy has outlived most of her generation, Spencer has had to come to terms with the deaths of many of her fellow cast members (most recently her good friend Edward Kelsey, who played Joe Grundy). Besides, she says briskly, Jack’s demise wasn’t as affecting as the day Peggy helped the vet to euthanise one of her cats on air. “I love cats, you see, and going through all the stages of putting one to sleep made me feel as if I’d really done it.”She doesn’t have a pet in England because she’s away so much, but she and her husband acquired a family of feral cats at their longstanding holiday home on the Spanish island of Menorca, where she still goes in breaks from recording. Which brings us to Hilda, the monster moggie who has recently been terrorising Ambridge. “Peggy always had these amenable cosy cats before and this one is a brute, but I gather that the audience love it,” she says. This can only be a good thing, because the Archers audience is one of the most formidable in broadcasting history, deploring the recent spate of melodramatic plotlines, correcting the tiniest of continuity errors and waging class war on behalf of the Grundys.There’s a copy of the fanzine Borsetshire Life in Spencer’s paper rack, so does she find the boundaries between reality and fiction blurring? Until she began to scale back, being Archers royalty mean there were a lot of village fetes to open, she says. But the paradox of being a radio star is that you can be a daily fixture in the life of the nation, yet walk down the street unrecognised. Until you open your mouth. She was disembarking from a plane in Menorca the other day when she stopped to thank the cabin staff, “and the stewardess said, ‘Are you famous? Ah yes, you’re Peggy Archer.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d31fa0eebab79f0eb1b0caa4b55dd5844b23de/0_72_5544_3326/master/5544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b685284a7fdf7d6c49fada7674116b5a","title":"beto o rourke new york run lgbtq rights 2020 democrat","story":" joined the Democratic 2020 contender Beto O’Rourke in New York for a 2km run to celebrate LGBTQ rightsBeto O’Rourke likes running. The presidential candidate has made jogging part of his election toolkit, from his campaign against the decidedly less athletic Ted Cruz, to repeated 5km jaunts across Iowa as he bids for the 2020 Democratic nomination.Wednesday morning saw O’Rourke’s latest display of physical prowess, as the former Texas congressman popped up in New York to run two miles with LGBTQ activists. O’Rourke is due shortly to launch a series of policies to protect gay rights.O’Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries.“Everybody ready to run?” O’Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. “Two miles is all we’re doing,” he added, which served to lift spirits a little.With that, O’Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs.Paul Humphries was dressed more traditionally, in shorts and a rainbow-emblazoned Beto for Senate T-shirt, although confessed he was not much of a trackman.“I am a runner, although not a very good one,” he said. Humphries is originally from Texas and has been living in New York for the past 15 years. Despite the Beto T-shirt, he is yet to choose a candidate to support. “It’s too early to say,” he said. “I’m still open. But I think Beto’s an important part of the conversation we’re having.”The O’Rourke campaign said the run was “in honor of Pride month”, and coincided with the unveiling of several LGBTQ-focused policies. As president, O’Rourke would take executive action to reverse Donald Trump’s ban on trans people in the military, his team said, and would create a universal healthcare system “with explicit protections against discrimination”.O’Rourke said: “Too many LGBTQ+ people still lack protection under many states’ laws and the current administration is encouraging rather than stamping out discrimination. We must ensure all Americans are treated equally no matter who they are or who they love.”O’Rourke has been criticized for an early lack of specific policy ideas – and a perceived sense of entitlement – but the Human Rights Campaign, in endorsing O’Rourke for the Senate in 2018, described him as a “proven champion of equality”. Runner Nora Moore said: “He’s an ally of so many marginalized communities and I think he walks the walk and I find that inspirational in a politician.”Moore, 36, was running with a stroller containing her four-year-old daughter Fiona. She said she has trained for two half-marathons in this fashion, and showed no signs of fatigue as the runners headed towards the finish. O’Rourke is Moore’s choice for the nomination “as of right now” she has been volunteering for his campaign in New York.She said: “I’m one of those complicit iniduals who sort of was asleep at the wheel a little bit, thought everything was great, assumed my girl Hillary was going to win, and then when it didn’t happen I just got really invested in being more involved.”Despite that, O’Rourke was defiant when the  asked about his drooping numbers.“There’s no poll taken in June the year before a presidential election that accurately predicted the outcome,” he said. He pointed to low polling numbers during his Texas Senate race.“We cannot allow polls to determine our chances. Nor as president will I allow polls to determine what we focus on. We’ll do what is right for the right reasons, regardless of the political consequences.”As for the run, O’Rourke showed no sign of tiring, unlike the . As this reporter strained to keep up, Moore dashed past, Fiona bobbing up and down in the stroller. She was followed by the man in the white jeans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/000557bb24705087f473f874b5f6b297b05c2b57/0_551_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccff51609e18eb21c73dd28bc3f9ba1f","title":"yevgeny prigozhin who is the man leading russias push into africa","story":"Former hotdog seller became known as ‘Putin’s chef’ because of his Kremlin catering contactsThe man behind Russia’s push into Africa is a former hotdog seller who went on to become a billionaire and global Kremlin action man thanks to his close relations with Vladimir Putin.Yevgeny Prigozhin grew up in Putin’s home city of Leningrad. He spent nine years in jail after being convicted by a Soviet court of robbery and other crimes. When he emerged from prison he decided to go into business, first opening a hotdog stall and then founding an elite restaurant.The venture on a docked boat was a success. In 2001 Prigozhin personally served two guests who had stopped by for dinner: Russia’s new president, Putin, and Japan’s prime minister, Yoshirō Mori. Soon Prigozhin was doing the catering for Kremlin banquets and for Putin’s 2003 birthday party, earning him the nickname “Putin’s chef”.On good terms with Russia’s elite, Prigozhin branched out. He won lucrative state contracts to supply food to Russian schoolchildren and to its soldiers. With money came an oligarch lifestyle: a palace in St Petersburg, a yacht, a private plane, a helipad.It is Prigozhin’s activities on behalf of the state that have made him notorious. According to the US special counsel Robert Mueller, Prigozhin’s trolls working out of the Olgino area of St Petersburg interfered in the 2016 election. Prigozhin, senior employees and his company, Concord Catering, are all under US indictment.Prigozhin is believed to be a funder of the Wagner group, a private military contractor. Hundreds of Russian mercenaries, some tied to Wagner, were reportedly killed in clashes with US forces during a doomed attempt to seize an oil refinery in Syria in February 2018. Other mercenaries have fought for Wagner in Ukraine.Critics including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny have described Prigozhin’s rise as a parable of Russia under Putin. Prigozhin has grown rich because of his proximity to Russia’s forever ruler, Navalny alleges. He has nicknamed Prigozhin the “king of dislikes”.Leaked documents paint a portrait of Prigozhin as a hyperactive businessman and micro-manager with a flair for logistics. As well as dispatching undercover political consultants to Africa, Prigozhin-linked companies have sent supplies of tea, coffee and pasta.

According to the indictment, she strove “to circumvent the rules and conditions governing the prime minister’s official residence in order to fraudulently obtain state funding for various expenses” from the years 2010 to 2013.In the plea deal, which was finalised in a Jerusalem court on Wednesday, she admitted to a lesser charge of “intentionally exploiting the mistake of someone else”, specifically by misleading officials who did not realise she already benefited from chefs on the government payroll.Under the terms of the bargain, she agreed to pay $2,800 in fines and hand $12,500 back to the state. The settlement also reduced the overspending in questions to around $50,000.The family lawyer confirmed the details of the deal but declined to comment further. The state attorney’s office justified its leniency in a statement, saying Netanyahu deserved credit for confessing to a criminal offence that she had consistently denied.The prime minister’s wife has long come under fire for extravagant spending and abusive behaviour. In 2016, a court ruled that she had mistreated a housecleaner and awarded the man $42,000 in damages. Other employees have accused her of abuse, charges she and her husband, Benjamin Netanyahu, reject.Former housekeeper Shira Raban is currently suing Sara Netanyahu for $63,000 in damages over mistreatment and harassment, her lawyer said. She made her first court appearance on Tuesday in Jerusalem.But the prime minister remains the focus of the family’s legal troubles. Benjamin Netanyahu is facing an indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, pending a hearing now scheduled for early October.He has pushed for a postponement, and can still request an extension from the supreme court.The prime minister is accused of accepting lavish gifts from billionaire friends, and promising to promote advantageous legislation for a major newspaper in exchange for favourable coverage.He vehemently denies wrongdoing, portraying himself as a victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt aimed at ousting him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8655ca6046a7f068b56bfd988d43bc4afebcb694/0_52_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=805b3532dd998a56205c20414c9d5edf","title":"venezuela releases new bank notes bolivars hyperinflation","story":"Banknotes of 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 bolívar denominations will begin circulating on Thursday, the central bank saidVenezuela is releasing new banknotes for the second time in less than a year, the central bank said on Wednesday, after hyperinflation eroded the effects of an August 2018 monetary overhaul meant to improve availability of cash.Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, last year cut five zeroes off the currency and prices.

File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923694.1560366938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us academic to develop irish language siri during 6 month gaeltacht stay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Kevin Scannell  will work with researchers from NUI Galway to research and develop computer resources for the Irish language.

He also works with Gmail, Twitter and WhatsApp to provide Irish localisations for software products.The academic said he plans to make use of “transfer learning” which allows resources for one language to be transferred directly to another (less well-resourced) language.

Like many of the BBC’s friends, I keep wondering how the organisation can keep shooting itself in the foot. It must look like a chunk of emmental by now,” Paxman said.Fogle announced that he will give his salary from Animal Park, his BBC One series, to Age UK, which is campaigning against the changes. The presenter said it is wrong to “penalise” the over-75s in this way.In a post on Instagram, Fogle said: “I love the BBC. I think it is one of the greatest institutions in the world. It is the envy of most nations, it makes amazing content and I’d argue it is still value for money.“I also owe my whole career to the BBC. They gave me my first break and they (you) employed me for many years but I am disappointed in the recent announcement on the abolition of free licences to the over 75s.”He explained: “I don’t entirely blame the BBC. I think the government forced their hand. I have decided to donate my entire salary for this year’s BBC Animal Park to subsidise licences for those over 75 who have no way of paying for a licence.Jeremy Paxman is among those who have spoken out about the decision“My late grandparents, Jean and Dick LOVED the BBC. They would have been lost without it in their twilight years… This is not virtue signaling (although I do think it’s time to rethink the licence) but we owe it to those over 75 who have served their country in the armed forces, the NHS, the fire service etc. Let’s not penalise those who most value the great BBC.”Fogle said he fears that “society is in danger of losing its moral compass. This is the least I can do for those over 75, an often neglected sector of society. Wouldn’t it be nice if we started respecting, loving and thanking our elderly population.”By last night, Age UK’s petition demanding that the government take back responsibility for funding free licences had amassed more than 340,000 signatures.Sir Michael Palin said: “I know that the BBC did a pretty bad deal, I think four years ago, saying it would take over the licences and I hoped somehow that would somehow go away and it hasn’t gone away…“I just wish it wasn’t at the expense of the people who now have to fork out for their licence.”Baroness Bakewell, the presenter and former ‘tsar’ for the elderly, said responsibility for the over-75s concession was “a government decision imposed on the BBC” and “pensioners who do not claim tax credits but are still needful should get a free licence”.D-Day veterans continued to criticise the BBC. Victor Gregg, 99, told GMTV that the corporation is “robbing the piggy banks” of the old. “I’ve always admired the BBC for it’s supposed integrity but coming out with this - it’s only days ago that they were patting all these old people on the head and calling them heroes.”But not all veterans share that view. Eddie Gaines, 94, said there are “plenty of rich people who are quite able to pay the TV licence”.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

A patient care bay being filled with liquid nitrogen A US man is suing a cryonics organisation for the return of his father\u0027s head, claiming he can never fulfill his dream of coming back to life because the rest of his body has been cremated. Kurt Pilgeram, 57, is seeking $1 million (£788,000) from Alcor Life Extension Foundation after receiving the rest of his father Laurence\u0027s remains from the facility.Dr Pilgeram, a prominent scientist who of devoted much his career to researching the aging process, paid $120,000 (£94,600) to preserve his body indefinitely in the hope that one day new technology could bring him back to life. Alcor, a pioneering non-profit organisation, uses cryonics, an experimental procedure using ultra-cold temperatures, to preserve its patients\u0027 bodies. Mr Pilgeram said that when his father died in 2015, at the age of 90, the Arizona-based organisation sent his ashes to his home in Dutton, Montana. Dr Pilgeram devoted much of his career to researching the aging process“They chopped his head off, burned his body, put it in a box and sent it to my house,” Mr Pilgeram told local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune.“Mutilation is basically what they did.” Alcor is still storing Dr Pilgeram\u0027s head, frozen in liquid nitrogen. James Arrowood, a lawyer for Alcor, told The : The twist in this case is that Laurence Pilgeram was one of the early scientists making his career out of the science of cryonics. The notion that he was unaware of the possibility having just his head preserved is just completely false.He added: I think a lot of people don\u0027t know that there\u0027s actually a logical basis for just saving the head. In this particular case, Laurence Pilgeram was absolutely aware of that. People in cryonics look at the brain as the centre of what\u0027s being preserved. If your body is diseased or very old, many in cryonics feel that it\u0027s just more efficient to save just the brain.Kurt Pilgeram\u0026#39s highly unusual case will likely be heard in 2020Mr Pilgeram is now demanding $1 million in damages, an apology from Alcor and the return of his father\u0027s head so it can be cremated.Alcor has robustly defended itself in the highly unusual case, saying that it fulfilled its side of the agreement - and accused Mr Pilgeram of trying to cash in on life insurance earmarked for his father\u0027s cryonics procedure. Mr Arrowood said: At the end of the day this case is really about whether a child can overrule a parent\u0027s wishes about what they want with their body.

We want to help customers remember their reusable bags in a way that will really stick with them.”“It’s certainly generated interest in what we’re trying to put out.

Shopping centre owner Intu, which counts Arcadia as a tenant in 35 of its stores, refused to accept rent reductions of 25 to 50 per cent.Intu was the largest single voice at Wednesday’s meeting with an average 15 per cent share of the vote across various different CVA proposals.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesCrown Estates, Aviva, British Land and Hammerson were among those who voted in favour.Sir Philip – who has been out of the UK\u0026nbspas allegations have mounted about sexual misconduct –\u0026nbspwas not at the meeting. His family’s £100m yacht, the Lionheart, was sighted in Sanremo, Italy.Many of Arcadia’s brands still face a difficult task ahead to transform their fortunes which have been declining for a number of years.Joanne Fearnley, partner and a commercial property expert at law firm Gordons, said:\u0026nbsp“The threat of administration has been lifted and jobs saved… for now.\u0026nbsp“As we are seeing with other retailers who have followed the same route, time will tell whether or not this is a temporary saving. It may be that the dent to the confidence of landlords will result in them putting in place contingency plans on the prime locations in particular, so that the demise of Arcadia becomes inevitable over time.”Concerns also remain about a “massive” deficit in Arcadia’s pension scheme. Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, asked for a binding assurances that Sir Philip and his wife Lady Tina Green will personally promise that scheme members will get their full entitlement.Mr Field said:\u0026nbsp“Now that, thankfully, Arcadia’s life has been extended, the committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them.”The retail magnate had initially offered Arcadia’s creditors a deal that would have seen 23 of 570 stores close with another 25\u0026nbspearmarked to shut in future. But landlords baulked at proposed rent cuts of between 30 per cent and 70 per cent on 194 stores.Last week, a crunch vote on the plans was postponed after it became clear that Arcadia would not get the support of 75 per cent of creditors that was needed to push the deals through.\u0026nbspThat forced Sir Philip to table a last-minute offer of 25-50 per cent rent reductions, with the Green family paying an extra £30m towards rents over three years.Sir Philip and his family have taken large sums of money out of Arcadia, including a £1.2bn idend in 2005, the biggest UK corporate pay check in history at the time. Critics have said that he and his wife could have stumped up more cash for the struggling group.Philip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireSir Philip Green’s retail empire on the brinkTopshop to close all US storesSir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresTopshop and Primark could be hiring children aged 14 in factoriesArcadia’s troubles in getting its plans through could mark a turning point as landlords increasingly push back against CVAs.A source close to one landlord said it was felt that many of Arcadia’s stores were in prime locations that could be re-let if a new tenant was required.One landlord told the Press Association that Arcadia’s situation was different to that faced by large department stores like Debenhams and House of Fraser that have also put forward CVA plans.“There was some sympathy for Debenhams,” he said,\u0026nbsp“whereas here you’ve got a bigger pool of potential tenants. You’ve got more options so it’s easier to vote against it.“Not that many people are that emotional about it – there’s no tears for Philip Green.”A spokesperson for The Crown Estate said: “While we have voted in favour, we have done so to secure our ability to take control where we feel that a better offer can be delivered for our destinations. This may include re-letting our spaces to new retailers who are more aligned with our ongoing commitment to creating great places for local communities.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIan Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, said on Wednesday: “We are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals and to Lady Green for her continued support.\u0026nbspAfter many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing.\u0026nbsp“From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth through our digital and wholesale channels, while ensuring our store portfolio remains at the heart of our customer offer.\u0026nbsp“I am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multichannel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand, and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business.“Finally, I would like to thank all of our team and advisors for their support throughout the CVA process. It has been incredibly challenging for all concerned but I believe this is the right outcome for all our creditors.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now Sir Philip and his executives have to revive the business\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentGreen’s empire has survived after creditors voted in favour of Company Voluntary ArrangementsSo Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia lives on after his second attempt at getting seven company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) approved was successful.\u0026nbspBut the landlords have sure sent out a message. Watch out you retailers. If you come brandishing these things because you want rent reductions and store closures we’re going to make it jolly hard for you. We’re not going to just roll over when you threaten to call in the administrators. We’ll huff and we’ll puff and we’ll make a big song and dance about squeezing you. Then we’ll cave.\u0026nbspThing is, they didn’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspPhilip Green’s retail empire saved from administrationPhilip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireHe might not be a billionaire any more, at least by the reckoning of The Sunday Times Rich List, but thanks to the money he’s been able to take out of Arcadia and his other retail businesses, Sir Philip still has more\u0026nbspthan enough in the bank to keep himself and his family in the style to which they have become accustomed.\u0026nbspThe yacht, the Monaco pad, their membership to the 0.001 per cent, or whatever it is, their prosperity wasn’t at stake. For the landlords, the equation looked rather different. If Arcadia went down, they knew they’d be left with empty premises to fill at a time when there aren’t many retailers interested in new space.\u0026nbspThis is why the property owners who still have Topshops or Burtons or Miss Selfridges or whatever after the store closures approved through the\u0026nbspCVAs, a form of insolvency that retailers have for years been using to cut their cost bases, backed them. They will now get some rent as opposed to months of nothing, and a\u0026nbspbit more than was on the table during Sir Philip’s first attempt at getting these through. Thousands of jobs have also been saved, which has to be welcomed.\u0026nbspHow long that rent and the wages those jobs pay will keep flowing remains to be seen. Sir Philip made his money less as a retailer than as a deal maker. At the height of his powers, he had half the City’s bankers clamouring to do his bidding and he was able to take millions out of the businesses he bought with their help, or at least his wife Tina was. It’s her name on top of Arcadia’s shareholder register. It’s her that’s officially putting £50m into the business and more into the group’s pension funds.\u0026nbspLately, Sir Philip’s reputation has taken a few knocks. I’m not talking about the non-disclosure agreements and super injunctions that have been generating headlines all over the place. I’m talking about his reputation as a businessman in the wake of the failure of BHS, and now these CVAs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Richer Sounds has signed up to be a living hours employerIn the world outside the freak show of a Tory leadership battle, good ideas still occasionally emerge in Britain.\u0026nbspThe Living Wage Foundation served one up this morning with the launch of a living hours\u0026nbspcampaign,\u0026nbspdesigned to address an issue that goes hand in hand with poverty pay: insecure employment.\u0026nbspAccording to the organisation, more than 5 million workers earning less than the real living wage, the one set by the Foundation based on what is required to be able to maintain a decent basic standard of living, are also in insecure work, unsure of what hours they will get from week to week. Some 2 million of them are parents, for whom the problem is particularly acute. Not knowing your hours and thus not knowing your income is the recipe for a boatload of stress, all the more so if your hourly rate is low and you need to run around trying to arrange potentially expensive childcare at the drop of your employer’s hat.\u0026nbspRudd says people should take zero-hour jobs to avoid benefits cutsZero good news on zero hours contracts?Number of zero-hours contracts rises by 100,000 in 2017, says ONSThe campaign aims to address this by offering Living Hours accreditation to employers that want to set an example of good practice alongside the existing Living Wage accreditation.\u0026nbspEmployers that sign up will be required to provide workers with at least four weeks notice of shifts, and a contract that accurately reflects hours worked, while guaranteeing a minimum of 16 a week.Supporting the launch were energy provider SSE, Standard Life Aberdeen, the insurance and fund management group, and Richer Sounds. If that name rings a bell, it’s the hi-fi retailer whose founder Julian Richer recently sold control of the business to his employees and put a cherry on top by using part of the proceeds to pay them all a bonus.Richer, a longtime opponent of the zero-hours contracts that have grown like a weed in the British labour market, says businesses that treat the people who work for them well benefit from happier, better-motivated employees who are inclined to stick around.His company shows just how potent that can be. On a high street that has seen more deaths than the average episode of Game of Thrones, Richer Sounds is thriving.Can you see the drawback? It’s all very well to sign up organisations that are already\u0026nbspprogressive employers\u0026nbsp(Richer basically sets the gold standard for the retail industry)\u0026nbspand that already have Living Wage accreditation.But the real problem lies elsewhere, with employers that range from not very good to the out-and-out awful. There’s a\u0026nbsplot of them about. The numbers the Foundation has produced demonstrate\u0026nbspthat.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

But it runs the risk of simply serving to make employers that are already good a bit better.\u0026nbspWhich brings us back to that Tory leadership campaign, most of whose runners would probably tell you zero-hours contracts are fine and dandy because workers “value their flexibility” when the flexibility is almost always with the employer, not the employee,\u0026nbspmost of whom would gladly trade it in for a tad more security.If the campaign does manage to guilt the odd bad employer into shaping up, it could be counted a success.\u0026nbspBut to end the exploitation embedded in the zero-hours culture it will take legislation, and probably a change of government.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shopping centre owner Intu, which counts Arcadia as a tenant in 35 of its stores, refused to accept rent reductions of 25 to 50 per cent.Intu was the largest single voice at Wednesday’s meeting with an average 15 per cent share of the vote across various different CVA proposals.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesCrown Estates, Aviva, British Land and Hammerson were among those who voted in favour.Sir Philip – who has been out of the UK\u0026nbspas allegations have mounted about sexual misconduct –\u0026nbspwas not at the meeting. His family’s £100m yacht, the Lionheart, was sighted in Sanremo, Italy.Many of Arcadia’s brands still face a difficult task ahead to transform their fortunes which have been declining for a number of years.Joanne Fearnley, partner and a commercial property expert at law firm Gordons, said:\u0026nbsp“The threat of administration has been lifted and jobs saved… for now.\u0026nbsp“As we are seeing with other retailers who have followed the same route, time will tell whether or not this is a temporary saving. It may be that the dent to the confidence of landlords will result in them putting in place contingency plans on the prime locations in particular, so that the demise of Arcadia becomes inevitable over time.”Concerns also remain about a “massive” deficit in Arcadia’s pension scheme. Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, asked for a binding assurances that Sir Philip and his wife Lady Tina Green will personally promise that scheme members will get their full entitlement.Mr Field said:\u0026nbsp“Now that, thankfully, Arcadia’s life has been extended, the committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them.”The retail magnate had initially offered Arcadia’s creditors a deal that would have seen 23 of 570 stores close with another 25\u0026nbspearmarked to shut in future. But landlords baulked at proposed rent cuts of between 30 per cent and 70 per cent on 194 stores.Last week, a crunch vote on the plans was postponed after it became clear that Arcadia would not get the support of 75 per cent of creditors that was needed to push the deals through.\u0026nbspThat forced Sir Philip to table a last-minute offer of 25-50 per cent rent reductions, with the Green family paying an extra £30m towards rents over three years.Sir Philip and his family have taken large sums of money out of Arcadia, including a £1.2bn idend in 2005, the biggest UK corporate pay check in history at the time. Critics have said that he and his wife could have stumped up more cash for the struggling group.Philip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireSir Philip Green’s retail empire on the brinkTopshop to close all US storesSir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresTopshop and Primark could be hiring children aged 14 in factoriesArcadia’s troubles in getting its plans through could mark a turning point as landlords increasingly push back against CVAs.A source close to one landlord said it was felt that many of Arcadia’s stores were in prime locations that could be re-let if a new tenant was required.One landlord told the Press Association that Arcadia’s situation was different to that faced by large department stores like Debenhams and House of Fraser that have also put forward CVA plans.“There was some sympathy for Debenhams,” he said,\u0026nbsp“whereas here you’ve got a bigger pool of potential tenants. You’ve got more options so it’s easier to vote against it.“Not that many people are that emotional about it – there’s no tears for Philip Green.”A spokesperson for The Crown Estate said: “While we have voted in favour, we have done so to secure our ability to take control where we feel that a better offer can be delivered for our destinations. This may include re-letting our spaces to new retailers who are more aligned with our ongoing commitment to creating great places for local communities.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIan Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, said on Wednesday: “We are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals and to Lady Green for her continued support.\u0026nbspAfter many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing.\u0026nbsp“From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth through our digital and wholesale channels, while ensuring our store portfolio remains at the heart of our customer offer.\u0026nbsp“I am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multichannel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand, and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business.“Finally, I would like to thank all of our team and advisors for their support throughout the CVA process. It has been incredibly challenging for all concerned but I believe this is the right outcome for all our creditors.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.Primavera is one of the biggest and most anticipated festivals around.

From the\u0026nbsp50th anniversary of partial decriminalisation of homosexuality to the fifth anniversary of same-sex marriage, we have much to be thankful for. The impact of these achievements,\u0026nbspand the rate of change, from when I attended an all boys Cof E school at the height of Section 28,\u0026nbspis monumental. At the same time, analysis by the University of Manchester\u0026nbspin 2018, based on a National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in 2010, concluded that British society may be reaching “peak acceptance” of LGBT lifestyle and people.\u0026nbspFrom a very early age I was expected to be a diligent, hard working, studious middle son but at school\u0026nbspI was labelled the gay boy, subjected to taunts and homophobic vitriol purely because of appearing effeminateHowever,\u0026nbspI am reminded of a recent conversation with a gay friend, who suggested that equality is a lofty ideal that is far from reality when taken at a societal level.\u0026nbspHis rhetoric was far more colourful than I can attest but he believed as\u0026nbspLGBT people we were still subjected to stereotyping because\u0026nbspwe live in a straight, heteronormative world that\u0026nbspignores and threatens our lifestyles.AFPGetty Images)In my work as Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and trans activist, I have striven for visibility and wider acceptance for the Gaysian community, from within my own community and the\u0026nbspwider society. Being of a British Pakistani heritage, I struggled to come to\u0026nbspterms with my identity, within myself and my family, and this was made doubly difficult by our obsession with labels.Lebanon blocks Grindr in latest attack on LGBT+ communityLGBT+ Muslims to lead Pride march with teacher at centre of protestsPrimary school to close early as anti-LGBT+ lesson protests escalateMalta named best destination for LGBT+ travellersThe\u0026nbspother boys saw me as an outcast, which had no grounding in truth. At this time,\u0026nbspI had no sense\u0026nbspof my own sexuality but in the course of being bullied\u0026nbspI grew to associate with the gay label. If everyone assumed the\u0026nbspyoung Asif\u0026nbspwas gay\u0026nbspthen it must be\u0026nbsptrue. Apart from being sexually attracted to boys I had no deep understanding of my sexuality or what I would, many years later, come to decipher as a differing gender identity.In these formative years I identified myself with the gay label because I\u0026nbspwas being oppressed by\u0026nbspit, which fits western stereotypes of effeminacy in boys as being a gay trait. In Pakistan and the south Asian subcontinent,\u0026nbsptrans identities have long been widely acknowledged, a world away from my British upbringing. It was only in my early thirties that I became fully aware of my trans identity and this only occurred when I stopped defining myself by societal standards.Cashman, comedian Rhona Cameron,\u0026nbspactivist Peter Tatchell and Graham Norton\u0026nbsp(Getty)I’ve had the privilege to come out twice.

At the height of the bullying I did not receive any visible support from teachers, who feared being reprimanded for going against the law.My\u0026nbspschool, with a 95 per cent majority Afro-Caribbean student body, and my British Asian ethnicity,\u0026nbsp also played a big part in my experience. The analysis by the University of Manchester found that BAME\u0026nbsppeople were more likely to hold negative views towards the LGBT community, particularly in the 1990s at the height of misinformation and fear about the HIVAids epidemic and governmental ineptitude.My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentimentOne of my parents’ main fears, which guided their decision to take me to the GP and the local imam, was that I had learnt to be gay because I was exposed to it, from school, from pop culture. Their interpretation of religion and south Asian cultural expectations made them question my foundations – the “gay”\u0026nbsplabel took many years to be normalised and understood within my family unit.At the root of their concern was my happiness and safety. My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay man in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentiment.Tatchell\u0026nbspin Brighton at Pride 2018 (Getty Images)I recently rediscovered\u0026nbspThe Velvet Rage\u0026nbspby Alan Downs, a book I had read in my twenties at the suggestion of my then civil partner who lauded it as ground-breaking. So much of it still resonates. Downs argued that growing up gay in a heterosexual world results in the internalisation of shame, a shame gay men may strive to obscure with material success, creativity, beauty or more severe forms of escapist gratification like substance abuse.The chemsex phenomenon, when people take drugs that enhance sex and make them feel uninhibited, has become a prominent subculture within the LGBT community, which has led to the UK’s criminal and health bodies formulating policy. From personal experience I struggled with my LGBT identity and my role within a greater society.Asifa Lahore: ‘I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim’ (Christine Hayter)Being of south Asian heritage and effeminate prevented me from being taken seriously. Fresh out of\u0026nbspthe Brit school, these loaded labels were a burden and affected my emotional wellbeing. After years of suppressing my creativity and personal growth, in a career that satisfied my traditional parents,\u0026nbspI created my drag alter ego Asifa Lahore –\u0026nbspmy decision to deviate from the rigid gender norm and toxic masculinity\u0026nbspI had been subjected to,\u0026nbspconsciously and subconsciously.Through Asifa Lahore,\u0026nbspI was able to express myself creatively in a physical form that better fitted society’s understanding of what was expected of an effeminate gay man. Through Asifa Lahore the drag queen, I found an art form that allowed me to subvert societal norms. But in a perverted way I was giving in to my critics, who expected that of me\u0026nbspas an effeminate gay man that\u0026nbspputting on a dress and wig would make more sense.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I couldPerforming at cabaret venues and events throughout Britain, I would be heartbroken by the lack of POC faces in the audience, not because they don’t exist but primarily because they don’t feel they belong in these primarily gay, white spaces. The LGBT scene has become more erse but it is still very whitewashed and, arguably, has\u0026nbspracist undertones. Many POC LGBT people complain\u0026nbspof being turned away from prominent gay clubs for not looking or sounding “gay”\u0026nbspenough.I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim. I\u0026nbspcouldn’t find a way to allow all these identities to co-exist. One of my first forays into the gay clubbing scene in the early Noughties resulted in a memorable conversation with a fellow clubber, a young white gay man who felt propelled to ask how I,\u0026nbspas a gay, brown Muslim man, could be dancing to Kylie. It was this and many other confrontations like these that led me to delve into my identity.Chutney queens is\u0026nbspan affectionate umbrella term used to describe drag queens who adhere to a Bollywood inspired, culturally south Asian aesthetic. Surrounded by these gregarious clubbers I felt accounted for. I belonged. Such safe spaces exist out of necessity, the need to feel represented.\u0026nbspI have opened my own club night, ‘Disco Rani’, which is a monthly Bollywood and Banghra club night that functions as a safe space for a wide cross-section of Gaysians.Similarly, we have seen a growth in BAME\u0026nbspPrides and events that commemorate our differences, supported by Stonewall but frowned upon by the old guard that question its necessity and the\u0026nbspfragmentation of the LGBT community. The harsh reality is that more work needs to be done to increase visibility and representation of all the peoples that make up the LGBT community and until then these Prides are needed.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I could.LGBT activists\u0026nbspdemonstrate against the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of\u0026nbspSection 377, which bans gay sex in a law dating from India’s colonial era (AFPGetty)As annual Pride celebrations begin in earnest I reflect on the importance of such events. Prides are an essential part of our celebration as LGBTQ+ people and now more than ever we must continue to show up and not forget our history. Rights that are long fought for can as quickly be taken away.Visibility must continue, especially in the current climate of the Parkfield school protests and the debate of LGBT education. Such a debate highlights the fact that –\u0026nbspfor all the legal rights and privileges the LGBT community has acquired – more needs to be done. Same sex relationships deserve acknowledgement on equal footing to heteronormative relationships. Visibility is one way to ensure our presence. As Marsha P Johnson did and as Peter Tatchell and Janet Mock continue to do, so we must stand up and make ourselves heard.Pride in 2019:\u0026nbspJoin The Independent for a panel discussion and Q\u0026ampA, with speakers including\u0026nbspAsifa\u0026nbspLahore, Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and\u0026nbsptrans\u0026nbspactivist, and human rights campaigner, Peter TatchellOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From sending emails to checking social media to driving to friend’s houses, batteries keep 21st-century life in motion.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis reliance is set to increase over the coming decades. As we move towards a coal-free future, batteries will increasingly be used in conjunction with renewable energy production.\u0026nbspOne problem with renewable energy sources is that turbines generate electricity only\u0026nbspif it\u0027s windy and solar panels work only\u0026nbspwhen the sun shines. Batteries help us get around this problem as they can store energy and release it when demand is high.\u0026nbspThis week it was announced that the UK\u0027s biggest battery was going to be built at Whitelee wind farm near Glasgow. The battery will store power generated by 215 turbines and should prop up the National Grid even when the wind is not blowing.Biggest battery ever seen in UK to be installed at Glasgow wind farmThis is expected to be the first of at least six similar projects across Scottish Power\u0027s renewable energy sites.\u0026nbspIt follows the world\u0027s largest battery installation in Adelaide in 2017. The project was built to store energy alongside Neoen’s Hornsdale windfarm, near Jamestown. At the end of last year figures presented by the Australian Energy Week suggested the new system had reduced the price of power outages by 90 per cent.\u0026nbspThese developments are often exciting but the raw materials used to build this technology come with their own environmental costs.\u0026nbspCurrently 75 per cent of the world’s lithium comes from Australia, Chile, Argentine and China. Some analysts fear that South America could become the new “Middle East” as battery power starts to replace coal. “Bolivia would become far more of a focus of world attention than Saudi Arabia ever was,” according to experts from Meridian International Research.A key element in lithium-iron batteries is cobalt in the positive electrodes (or cathodes). More than 60 per cent of the world\u0027s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u0026nbspChinese companies are running many of the country’s industrial mines using more than 35,000 children – some as young as six – to do the dirty work. They are risking their lives to mine cobalt for big electronic firms, many of which are likely to be aware of the appalling conditions they work in.\u0026nbspThere is also a geopolitical risk\u0026nbspif governments decide to restrict supply.A 2015 report found that 82 per cent of the world’s graphite – another key component in batteries – comes from China. Manufacturers should be concerned about the supply of key components becoming centralised in one country.\u0026nbspThere is a lot of enthusiastic investment in batteries but we need to think carefully about the environmental and political implications of extracting metals that made them.\u0026nbspRecycling rates for lithium are currently very low and if we continue to discard old metals, battery power might not look so green after all.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance.”Addressing those who suggested the head resembled that of a bear, Dr Protopopov said: “It is definitely a wolf. Maybe the hair colouring makes people think it is a bear, but actually it is quite strange to hear, as morphologically this is a very typical wolf. “Yet when we made CTA scans of the wolf, we found out there are some peculiarities.“Some parts of the skull are more developed than in modern wolves.”He added: “We want to find out if this represents the inidual characteristics of this very specimen or if this can be a wolf sub-species, given the different environment in which these animals lived.He said he was doubtful the specimen was a direwolf – an extinct species which populated North America at the end of the Pleistocene and which at the time was joined to Siberia by a land bridge.“I would say it was not a direwolf, but we are not ready to give exact size of this wolf when it was alive.Return of the wolf: Not big or bad, just misunderstood‘Swarms’ of wolf-dog hybrids sweeping EuropeScientists ‘one step closer’ to bringing back woolly mammothsWhy mammoths, sabre-tooth tigers and other ‘megafauna’ went extinct“It was definitely smaller than modern Arctic wolves, closer to the common wolf in its size.”The research team is in the process of planning a return expedition to the site to see if further remains can be found.Dr Protopopov said the colouring of the preserved hairs were not indicative of how the animal would have appeared when it was alive, as the natural pigments had been destroyed and replaced by colouring from the permafrost.“As a result, we cannot add any information to the discussion on whether the Pleistocene wolves were grey or dark,” he said.The earth in Yakutia is typically frozen all year round, but climate change means previously frozen soils are increasingly easy to explore, giving rise to a large mammoth-tusk hunting industry, from which an increasing number of paleontological finds have been made.The exhibition in Tokyo featuring the wolf head is also exhibiting the carcass of a cave lion cub believed to be 50,000 years old.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture. Those flamenco guitars and heady summer vibes only add to the sense that, however fleeting that time was, certain memories stay with us forever.This disco-infused number should sound more dated than it actually does. “Who Do You Think You Are” is the Spice Girls at the height of their pop powers a slick, infectious and superbly produced jam with that brass punching through.Mel C gets the spotlight on this funk-influenced number, which was written during the same session as “Love Thing” and features an excellent harmonica solo from Judd Lander. It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sooner or later that debt is paid.”It’s open to debate whether the disaster, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s  quote in the credits suggested, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.What’s undeniable is that Chernobyl is one of the greatest TV dramas of the century.The beautul and touching tribute  Up paid to Lynn Johnson. Over-caffeinated tubbalump Piers Morgan once again turning Good Morning  Britain’s week into a captivating and unmissable mix of news, sport, presidential interviews, free- wheeling abuse and fantastically rude suggestions about Susanna Reid’s love le.And Harry Hill breaking off an insanely funny episode of Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by TalkSport genius Paul Hawksbee, to wonder: “Could I just live off the money from You’ve Been Framed ”Yes, but please don’t.RANDOM TV irritations: Killing Eve II posting a good mid-term shout for the most over-rated and unpleasant show of .The Sky Atlantic continuity pox who talked all over the closing credits of Chernobyl.ITV’s Clive Tyldesley sounding more like a fan than a commentator at the Euro Nations.And Love Island’s Iain Stirling “sending solidarity to the Donald Trump blimp protesters”, at the end of Good Morning Britain, like he was Lech Walesa addressing Gdansk shipyard workers, rather than the ITV dating show bloke doing the warm-up slot for Lorraine Kelly.THE week’s most eye-catching documentary began with a production assistant vox-popping some chimpanzee sex videos and a startled shopper exclaiming:  “Oh wow.“You’re really showing this on Channel  ”What  You thought better of the network behind Naked  Attraction Of course they’re showing My Gay Dog  And Other Animals, a right-on farce which attempted to prove the impossible via a mutt called Norman, whose rear end received not a moment’s peace from a humping little nuisance called Franco, an Italian Greyhound, who really should’ve been called Bruno or Tonioli.There were also “gay” lions and sheep, “bisexual” binobos and some field study input from Professor Paul Vasey, who’s been observing “lesbian” macaques for  years but, like all academics, still has more questions than answers: “Are they doing this to commun- icate about dominance “Are they doing this to form alliances “Are they doing this to reconcile conflict ”Or are they just doing this ’cos they  can’t get Wentworth on Netflix You tell me, weirdo.After a solid hour of virtue-signalling and speculation, though,  it was left to the narrator to tell us what any  three-year-old could’ve explained  minutes ago.“We can’t confirm Franco’s sexuality   per cent, however . . .”BZZZZZ.

In fact, they have all been produced and distributed by the BBC’s rivals.This week there was uproar after the BBC announced that over-s will now lose the right to their free TV licence, saving around £m per year.And we all know where theyll be splashing this cash - chasing the elusive youth market whove turned away from the BBC in their droves in favour of online streaming services like Netflix, Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video.But as a -year-old who ditched their licence fee last year - instead Im a fully paid-up member of Generation Netflix - I can tell them theyre going about it all wrong.For young people like me, it’s clear that the BBC is stuck in the past. In fact, it’s so out-of-touch that it still offers a discount for anyone whose TV only works in black and white.It’s easy to see how the Beeb’s snooty tone and we-know-best attitude earned it the nickname ‘Auntie’. Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many branded the concept of a licence fee as “outdated” in a world of digital streaming. Others said it was immoral for BBC boss Tony Hall to penalise pensioners when he was paying sky-high salaries to presenters such as Gary Lineker and Graham Norton.Campaigners said that although the changes appear to make the system fairer it will make watching TV unaffordable for , pensioners.Elderly Brits took to the airwaves to vent their anger and disappointment at the BBC yesterday, with GMB Presenter Susanna Reid fighting back tears when an elderly woman explained how TV was her main source of entertainment and begged the Beeb to rethink its decision.This absurd tax on your telly belongs to another century.

hour.But by .pm Janet called again, telling the Sun Online: “I rang back but they said they couldn’t get any of the contractors to go out.“They said they don’t go out for gypsy fairs – they don’t put their driver’s le in jeopardy.”She said she had tried to tell the operators she was in the field by herself, with everyone having already gone home, but it wasn’t until .am that she was finally told she would have to leave her car and caravan and be put up in a hotel.The -year-old was made to trek through the field to meet the taxi, which finally took her to the hotel in the early hours of the morning.But the situation continued to worsen by Monday when she was told a RAC contractor would be with her car by am – but was then informed at am the appointment had in fact been booked for Tuesday.After a number of calls, a contractor finally did come to help her on Monday to load her car and caravan onto a truck, with it finally delivered to her Skegness home yesterday.She said it was only thanks to another kind traveller nearby who came to wait with her that she managed to get through.Helpless Janet, who was selling dolls at the event, said: “It’s absolutely made me distraught.“I just feel like I’ve been lied to and told this and that. I’ve lost all my confidence.”Thousands of gypsies had turned out for the annual event at the Cumbrian village of the weekend - with it the biggest gypsy festival in Europe.In photographs after the fair, her car could be seen sitting in the middle of the field with its bonnet open.And the incident has left Janet, who said she struggles with depression, often bursting into tears.She said: “It’s discrimination.“I pay my subscription – the contract didn’t say anything about attending travellers fairs.”An RAC spokesperson said: We would like to apologise to Miss Simpson for the delay in recovering her vehicle and caravan.As a result we paid for her to stay in a hotel for the night and for a -mile taxi journey to get her home the next day.The earliest record of the Appleby Fair is in a charter from Henry II, dating from the th century, but it is believed to have an even longer tradition than that.The Gypsy and Traveller attendees include British Romanichal, Irish Travellers, Scottish Gypsy and Welsh Gypsies known as Kale.The fair is primarily about buying and selling horses but it is also an opportunity for travellers to swap tales and let their hair down, enjoying the socialising and friendly atmosphere."},{"url":null,"title":"families kicked out caravan site not gypsies","story":"The happy little community in Enderby, Leics could now be torn apart after town hall chiefs ruled they were unlawfully renting mobile homes and breached planning permissions.The drama unfolded when the mobile homes on Field View Park and The Old Stables were approved for traveller use in .But when the council-taxpayer owners applied for permission to enable non-travellers to live there, they were refused by the Blaby District Council.The move means  families now face becoming homeless in just  days.Andrew Field, , said he had been living at the site with his we Lesley, , for three years, saying: We are very angry, some people cannot afford to rent where.The council told us because we are not travellers, we had to leave the site and live where.Its not fair, its almost a form of racism. We feel we are being discriminated against.And he said he was determined to stay, despite the council threatening to send out enforcement notices soon.Andrew said: Weve got families living here, single parents and lots of kids who could be homeless.All the children get along and you can always seeing them playing with each other whether they are traveller or not.Amy Ruddle, who lives on The Old Stables site, said: Were being told we have to leave because were not gypsies.We moved here when we couldnt find anywhere that we could afford to rent locally, initially we signed for six months, but we liked it so much weve stayed.My daughter is about to start her final year of GCSEs, my eight-year-old is in primary school, we dont want to move.It would mean leaving our home, our community and a change of school and not one of those councillors seemed to think about that.If I look for a three bedroom house in this area Id be looking at paying £ - £ a month, my rent here is half that and I want to live here. I dont see the problem.Planning rules mean that exceptions apply to properties occupied by travellers so because the permission to place the mobile homes was granted just for traveller use.A Blaby District Council spokesperson said: Blaby District Council has a responsibility to ensure that proposed residential development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework and our Local Plan policies.The two sites which were considered at planning committee on  June  were The Old Coal Yard and Field View Park on Kirk Lane, Enderby both of which are in the districts Green Wedge, which legally have planning permission for mobile homes for gypsy and traveller use only.The applications sought to extend the permission to the use of the sites as mobile home sites for non gypsy travellers, to regularise the position, as over a number of years the owners of the site have unlawfully rented mobile homes in breach of the planning permission.These applications were both refused on the basis that they are in the Green Wedge as well as several other technical reasons.Enforcement action is underway, the council does not believe there is any imminent risk of residents being made homeless as a result of these decisions, however any resident with any concern, should contact our housing options team, which are always available for advice and support.We would urge anyone looking to move into a mobile home site to check its planning and licensing status with the council before occupation."},{"url":null,"title":"dobby elf mystery viral cctv","story":"They have come up with answers by analysing the surveillance footage which sent the internet into a spin last week.Vivian Gomez, a mother of a nine-year-old boy, was left stunned when her CCTV captured a bizarre creature - which looked like Dobby the Elf from the Harry Potter films - outside her home.Gomez uploaded the footage and said the creature was frolicking in the night on her driveway in Colorado Springs.She shared the clip on Facebook, writing: “So I woke up Sunday morning and saw this on my camera and am trying to figure it out.First I saw the shadow walking from my front door then I saw this thing....has anyone  seen this on their cameras.The other two cameras didn’t pick it up for some reason.She added that the figure stopped at the front of the car and then did a little dance.In an interview with Inside Edition, Gomez admitted her son, Bobby, likes to joke around and loves to dance.When asked whether the creature could be her son, Gomez replied: No ... I wouldnt let him out at dark by himself.She also said none of the neighbourhood children looked anything like the creature.Self-declared experts said they were certain the footage had not been doctored with computer trickery.And some web sleuths claimed they had the answer to the mystery.They claimed the creature was most likely a skinny child wearing flip-flops and pants on their head.Whatever the explanation, many Potter fans were eager to celebrate a possibleof Dobby, as the beloved character tragically died in the sixth film Deathly Hallows.Maury Wills wrote on Facebook: “Dobby came to make sure you are safe!”One Twitter user then added: “Everyone’s joking that this is Dobby but I’m here deciding not to go outside at night ever again.”Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that at one stage in the video there appears to be two shadows which suggests someone could be operating an elf-like puppet.Another explanation offered was that the weird figure was superimposed onto the footage using some clever camera trickery.Reactions to Dobbys death were so emotional that writer JK Rowling was moved to apologise on Twitter in  for killing off the free elf.This year, I apologise for killing someone who didnt die during the #BattleofHogwarts, but who laid down his le to save the people whod win it.

water flowing again.This evening it opened an emergency bottled water station in Hampton after thousands of homes were left with little or no water.The move came after panic buyers emptied shops of tens of thousands of bottles of water - some were seen loading dozens into supermarket trolleys.Pictures were posted on social media showing shelves stripped bare of drinking water as people were left without supplies for hours. Many worried customers have also been tweeting to ask when emergency supplies would be issued by the authorities.Others were quick to askthey would be receiving any compensation as a result of the water supply outage.One Twitter user, who was recovering from surgery, askedanyone knew when bottled water was being distributed, adding she cant carry heavy things and my local is out of bottled.Kerry Watts also wrote: Five hours without water - surely its time to get some bottles out to the most needy Residents in Whitton, Teddington and Isleworth have also been

The couple, who are madly in love  years after marrying, say their intimacy is as strong as ever despite Ednaaposs age. She said: We are still intimate in the bedroom as much as any couple in love.    Weaposll often stop in the street and have a damn good kiss - Iaposve never felt conscious of the age gap in public. I kiss Simonaposs neck and pinch his bum in the supermarket - he will twang the back of my bra in the queue. We just do what two people in love do. The couple made national headlines in  as their love became public - with cynics suggesting Edna, now a great-grandmother-of-one, was looking for a naive toyboy.  But they have more than proved the doubters wrong. They renewed the wedding vows at their home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, in  and have developed the pet names aposPigletapos and aposPigletteapos in recent years. Simon, an excellent organist, is regarded a musical genius in local circles. He continues to charm Edna playing her favourite song aposGoodnight, sweetheartapos on the organ. He regularly toured the country before type two diabetes and a kidney transplant forced him into retirement. Simon, who suffers with dyslexia, dyspraxia and Aspergeraposs syndrome, can listen to a tune once before he could play it off the top of his head.  Edna, a grandmother-of-four, added: We love each other more than before - the love has grown over the years, itaposs absolutely wonderful. Simon has had his health problems and Iaposm getting older now, but do you know anyone who is getting younger  Simon had a kidney transplant four years ago and has been diagnosed with type two diabetes so I have to feed him right. I have a push along walking thing as I struggle with my mobility but as one gets older these things happen. We support and love each other - le couldnapost be better. Our love gets bigger and bigger all the time.  Edna, a retired engineer who later became secretary for a local theatre organ club, met Simon in . Simon, who had never had a girlfriend before, said it was love at first sight. The pair bumped into each other at a concert as Edna welcomed Simon in through the venueaposs back door. Simon, who at just over ft tall is shorter than Edna, said: It was a concert at the Odeon in Weston which had started by the time Iaposd arrived so I went around to the emergency exit. Ed opened the door and it was love at first sight. She was standing there in a nice, black suit and she opened her arms. We literally fell into each otheraposs arms. I thought to myself aposSheaposs a bit of alrightapos.  The pair exchanged letters and phone calls in the following months and would fleetingly see one another at organ concerts around the UK. But their romance was confirmed when they passionately kissed beneath Weston-super-Mare pier after a concert. Edna, who attended grammar school and worked as a civil engineer until retiring in her s, has children from a previous -year marriage. Her children - Lorraine, , and Russell,  - have always been supportive of their relationship. Russell, who shares a love of computers with Simon, even sends him cards on Fatheraposs Day and pulls his leg by calling him dad.  Recalling how they met, Edna said: We both share a passion for organ music and moved around in similar circles. I kept hearing about this aposfunny little manapos named Simon Martin and I thought our paths will have to cross at some point.

Duchess of Cambridge chose a glittering ensemble for her meal, prepared by people whose lives have been touched by drugs and alcohol. Unlike the gloomy weather in central London, the royal was full of summer cheer and bloom as she met guests who have beaten addiction. The event was hosted by charity Action on Addiction, of which Kate is a patron.The mum-of-three chose a cream, off-the-shoulder dress by Barbara Casasola. The duchess has been patron for the charity, which offers le-saving treatment to both iniduals and their families, since . Speaking at the dinner, Kate said: Sadly, for many who are suffering with addiction, they just don’t receive the help they need early enough.    Action on Addiction was one of my very first patronages, and as such, it is very close to my heart.   I’m hugely passionate about the support it provides, especially for parents, children and families who suffer from, or through, addiction.   And in some ways, it was the catalyst for my interest in early childhood development. The royal said the root causes of drug and alcohol addiction could often be traced back to the very earliest years, as she called for help to break the inter-generational cycle. She added: For the last few years, I’ve been focusing on the importance of prevention:  how can we all really support the earliest years of le, build foundations, and help avoid adversity later on in le.     Having met so many people who’ve suffered from addiction, I have seen over and over again that, sadly, the root causes can so often be traced right back to the very earliest years of someone’s le.   Trauma experienced in early childhood, in some cases, as a result of separation, abandonment, abuse, or even emotional neglect, can have a lasting effect. What we experience during our earliest years, even while we’re still in the womb, shapes the developing brain.   It is therefore vital that we support everyone  who cares for children in those formative years, especiallywe want to help with the inter-generational cycle of addiction.  Sadly, for many who are suffering with addiction, they just don’t receive the help they need early enough. They have already reached crisis point before the support they need. What’s remarkable about Action on Addiction is that it goes beyond helping those who are suffering on the courageous journey into recovery - but it also lends direct support to the children and families affected by addiction – for as long as it takes.   This evening’s dinner not only marks ‘Addiction Awareness Week’, but it also provides an opportunity for us to remember the vital work being done to help all those affected by addiction feel able to access help, hope and freedom from their addiction. There was never a more important time for Action on Addiction to succeed. And I, for one, could not be more delighted to support such a special organisation.  It was the first annual gala dinner in recognition of Addiction Awareness Week, hosted by chef Skye Gyngell and Action on Addiction, a British charity working in research, treatment, family support and professional education.  A spokesman said Action on Addiction builds communities of recovery for iniduals and families by developing the best quality and most effective residential and community-based addiction treatment services in the UK and promoting self-help, peer-to-peer support, and community cohesion.

The Grand Pearl, in Manchester city centre, is said to contain  rooms and operates under the tagline aposParadise here on earthapos. As well an Olympic sized swimming pool, a glass walled riverside restaurant and a penthouse suite complete with a baby grand piano, the hotel is packed with rooms of dynamic luxury. Not all is at it seems however.The listed address doesnapost actually exist and the phone number, when called by the Manchester Evening News , isnapost answered.   The cityaposs council has warned it is a sham, with the website linked to an IP address in Nigeria. The website claims that the Grand Pearl is one of the newest  star hotels in the city, operating since  and hosting thousands of guests in that time - including celebrities and politicians. Photos show large double beds lying beneath expansive headboards, with plenty of room to relax in the seating area or get down to some important work at the desk. One clue that the hotel is less corporal than advertised are the landscapes visible through the window. In one a majestic cityscape has skyscrapers towering above what appears to be a Tokyo skyline. In another a palm tree stands out against the bright blue sky and sea.    The continuity error hasnapost stopped the website host asking £ for the cheapest room. Those looking to check in to the fictional hotel can rest assured they will be in safe hands. Around the clock security guards and an in-house medical team guarantee guestsapos security. The website boasts: Dangers of many kinds can lurk at any corner therefore we have taken all necessary measures to ensure your safety and peace of mind while playing host to you.” A -space car park, casino, art gallery, grand ballroom for as many as  people and an outlet selling Versace are other key features.    A number of customer testimonials featured on one page of the site speak highly of the hotel, despite its total lack of existence. One, posted by George B B from Sheffield, reads: “This hotel must have the most comfy beds in Manchester! Itaposs ideally located for nights out, also has a great bar.” Angela Bunett from Madrid recalls a stay for a friendaposs th birthday. “We did not get to eat in the Grand Pearl Oval Restaurant as we failed to make reservations on time and it was fully booked,” she wrote.    “The sunny personality of the concierge was heartwarming. Did not get his name but when I do I will mention him in my next review as I will be staying there again shortly. Keep up the good work. Location superb.” In an attempt to confirm the existence of the mystery hotel Manchester Evening News reporter Chris Slater went to the given address only to find an empty parking lot and an office. A receptionist inside the building told him: We often get people coming in asking for the Radisson but never that one.    In fact we get people who are lost and are looking for hotels all over the city and I have never, ever heard of the Grand Pearl. That sounds more like a Chinese buffet restaurant than a five star hotel. A council spokesman advised tourists to book through a reputable travel agent or booking website when searching for holidays or accommodation. They added: Guidance on how to avoid scams can be found through the Association of British Travel Agentswebsite, at www.abta.

Not far away her friends were fully immersed in Spiceworld and having the time of their lives. I went to Bristol, got to the gate and they scanned my ticket and said that it wasn’t accepted and to go to the box office to try and sort the issue, she said. I went to the box office and it turns out that somebody had entered the venue on the ticket a good hour before I arrived. So basically my ticket wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. Emma was told she could buy another ticket, but decided not to as she was unsure sheaposd get a refund for the dud. She said: I listened to them from outside the venue instead. I was more annoyed about the fact that you are given a guarantee by these people, and it turned out to be rubbish.    Emma has been a fan of the Spice Girls since they broke into the music scene and was even given the nickname Baby Spice by her work colleagues. She said: They were the revolution of girl power back then, my work colleagues nicknamed me Baby Spice because of my name and the blonde hair. I spent many a night dancing to the Spice Girls and I never got to see them the first time around, so I was really looking forward to seeing them now. They sounded really good from outside the stadium. I wish I was in there so I could be a part of it and soak up that atmosphere Everyone walking in were happy and smiling and having fun. It looked like it was going to be good fun. Emmaaposs friends did not realise that she had not been allowed in and believed that she just struggled to find them inside the stadium.    She said: They were upset, they just thought I couldn’t find them on the pitch and I just boogied along somewhere , so when we met back up they were asking did I like it, what did I think and I was like aposI didn’t get inapos. They were upset and upset for me, but on the bright side, they were freezing and like drowned rats and I was warm and dry. You have to make the best of it, I could have gotten angry and kicked off, but it wouldn’t have changed anything, so I just had my boogie outside the stadium with the security people. Emma has since been given a full refund and a £ voucher to spend on Stubhub. A StubHub spokesperson said: We are a fan first marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of tickets to live events. In the rare event that a buyer is refused entry to the event, our FanProtect Guarantee kicks in. As a result, Emma received a full refund for her ticket and we continue to investigate why she was unable to access the event.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nurse who duped women sending","story":"NewsNurse who duped women into sending nude pictures faces prison again over new conAdele Rennie, , used male aliases to pursue online relationships with ten women when she worked at Crosshouse Hospital in AyrshireShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUN NewsAdele Rennie used aliases and a voice changing app in her scams \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A stalker nurse who posed as a male doctor and used a voice changing app to con women into sending explicit photos of themselves is back in jail after a new scam failed.Adele Rennie struck again just  months after her release from prison.

As part of their Autumn tour, Harry will travel to Angola, where Diana famously visited in January , just months before her tragic death. The striking image of The Princess of Wales, wearing a protective visor and vest and walking through a minefield, became etched in history and highlighted the important work by the HALO Trust. Palace aides are investigating Angola’s security situation to seeMeghan and the couple’s newborn son Archie will be able to join Harry. However, they are expected to travel together for at least some of the African tour, which will also take in Malawi to expand the reach of his charity Sentebale, South Africa and possibly Botswana.    Harry in  travelled to Cuando Cubango region in southeast Angola with the charity of which he is a patron, and saw first-hand the impact of landmines on communities and the human suffering they cause. The Duke has told close confidants of his desire to “fulfil his mother’s legacy” in many aspects of her humanitarian and conservation work. A major project for the Duke and Duchess to spend up to six months at a time living in Africa over the next two to three years is already underway. A foreign sabbatical is something Harry has wanted to pursue for many years and sources close to him have revealed the couple both want to focus on issues around conservation, the environment and education. One royal source said: “Harry has made no secret of what an influence his mother has been on him. “His trip to Africa comes at a time in his le where he has become a parent himself. “Diana had a great affinity with children and recognised the worth of having boots on the ground could affect change in such an important way. “This is all about wanting to fulfil his mother’s legacy and showing his we and baby son the places that have had the most positive affect on him in his le.”    In  on International Mine Awareness Day, Harry said his mother’s work on banning landmines in the last months of her le “wasn’t universally popular”. He added: “Some believed she had stepped over the line into the arena of political campaigning – but for her this wasn’t about politics it was about people.” Harry said: “She knew she had a big spotlight to shine, and she used it to bring attention on the people that others had forgotten, ignored or were too afraid to support.” Botswana - which Harry has previously described as his ‘second home’ - is has also been suggested as a destination, as well as South Africa. The Queen appointed her grandson one of its youth ambassadors last year and sees him as an important proponent of her legacy. The Sussexes’ advisers are working on a tailored role for the couple with the help of Sir David Manning, a former ambassador to the US, and Lord Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary who chairs the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust.    Sources close to former Prime Minister Tony Blair have also told The Mirror how Harry’s decision could be based on Diana’s plans with the Labour leader to create a bespoke role for her as a roving international peace envoy in the months before she died. In an interview after she died in a Paris tunnel on August ,  Blair said: “She had a tremendous ability, as we saw over the land mines issue...to enter into an area that could have been one of controversies and suddenly just clary for people what was clearly the right thing to do. “I felt there were all sorts of ways that could have been harnessed and used for the good of people.” He added: “Compassion is the best legacy. That is what she was about.” Harry’s first step will be next Monday to attend a Chatham House Africa Programme event on ‘Mine Clearance, Conservation, and Economic Development in Angola’, Buckingham Palace confirmed today. The event is being held in partnership with the HALO Trust, with the Angolan Government about to provide £ million of funding to clear landmines in two national parks, a major opportunity for the conservation of southern Africa’s last great wilderness. The Africa Programme event will highlight the connection between conservation, economic development, and mine clearance, with a call to action for increased funding for mine clearance efforts in Angola.

Lewis King claims he did  hours’ worth of unpaid shts at Stack It High Sell It Cheap in Hull in preparation for what he hoped would be a permanent role. However, manager Hafiza Riaz claims Mr King only did one full sht before “walking out” midway through his second sht – something he disputes. However, Ms Riaz confirmed Mr King was not paid for any of the work he did at the store at the end of May. He now wants the shop to reimburse him for his travel costs and for the hours he spent working in the store. Mr King, , told Hull Live : “I worked for free and it felt like slave labour. I’m on Universal Credit and have £ to live on a month after I’ve paid everything and I must have spent £ of that on transport to get to the shop. “£ is a big chunk of money for me and losing that has left me struggling. It’s about a fth of my money and it leaves me out of pocket. “I could have used that money to go and see my mum but instead I’ve spent it on something . I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of and I am desperate because £ a month is pretty much nothing.”  Mr King, who helped to unload stock and carry out transactions on the tills, says he worked three shts on May , May  and June , before being told he could not get the hours he wanted to work for another two months. However, Ms Riaz says the teenager worked one five-hour sht before disappearing on his second sht without telling any members of staff. She said: “He did one sht and then he came the next time and just left without telling me. I asked other staff and they said he just left without telling anyone. “He didn’t do  hours. He did a few hours as a trainee and we are allowed to give out one sht without pay as a trainee.”  Mr King came out of care just a few months ago and has managed to find a flat in the city centre. However, he has made a desperate plea for a job so that he can carry on supporting himself financially when he starts college later this year. “It’s been a struggle ever since I left care,” Mr King said. “I was moved to Doncaster but moved back to Hull and stayed in a hostel for two months. But I stopped paying rent because of mice and I had to find a private tenancy. “It was the cheapest I could afford and I want to try and get a job to fund that. I’m trying to find whatever work I can - I enjoy bar work and I’ve had experience in that but I’m trying to find any job I can.” Ms Riaz could not confirm whether or not Mr King would have been offered a job but saidhe had he would have been employed on a zero-hours contract.

However, amidst the watery deluge is a slight silver lining.   While it might not compare to the scorching weather Brits enjoyed this time last year, the temperature will be cranked up a few notches going into next week.By next Wednesday or Thursday the mercury will reach the low twenties Celsius, with an outside chance that temperatures will hit C. Alex Deakin, meteorologist for the Met Office, was quick to pour unseasonably cold water on any hopes of a heat wave however.    Although weaposre talking about warmer weather I am not talking about hot and sunny, and itaposs not necessarily even going to be dry everywhere, he said. There will still be showers around through into next week. It should be sunnier, but that is not dficult given how much cloud and how much rain we have seen over recent days.    The miserable weather that has hung over Britain for the past week is unlikely to sht immediately because of a rigid jet stream pattern. By the middle of next week the west to east weather driver will be broken up, meaning low pressure in northern Europe will begin to sht. This should allow a warmer front to move up from the south.    Little is due to change before then however. Earlier today the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for Wednesday and Thursday. Heavy downpours threaten to flood parts of the country, with the east, north-east and north England most likely to be affected.  Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: Unfortunately thereaposs more heavy rain expected over the next few days. Most areas will see rain at some point on Wednesday and Thursday will also be unsettled. By Friday there will be a mix of sunshine and showers with the picture improving into the weekend. But it will still be cool with outbreaks of rain.    Flash flooding left stretches of the the M submerged underwater overnight while the M was closed following the discovery of sinkholes. Many trains in the south and south-east where cancelled after heavy showers left tracks underwater. Following more than flash flood warnings June is set to be the wettest on record.

Amber Kyzer broke down in tears as she was called to testy at the trial of ex-husband Timothy Jones Jr. She said she wished mercy on him despite hearing horric details of how he killed the youngsters in August . He accidentally killed one of their sons by making him do an excessive number of push-ups and squats for an hour before strangling the other four. He then drove them across several American states for nine days before dumping their bagged bodies off a dirt road. Jones, , who was found guilty last week, claimed an angry gremlin voice in his head told him to murder Abigail, one, Gabriel, two, Nahtahn, six, Elias, seven and Merah, eight, at their home in South Carolina, US.    The jury is considering whether Jones should be executed or jailed for le. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Amber told the courtroom: “I hear what my kids went through and endured and, as a mother,I could personally rip his face off, I would. That’s the momma bear in me, wanting him to feel everything they felt. I don’t personally feel I have the right to put anyone’s le in my hands.  “The mom in me says, ‘Fry him, absolutely.’ But I’m a strong believer in no death penalty. “He did not show my children any mercy by any means. But my kids loved him andI’m speaking on behalf of my kids and not myself, that’s what I have to say.    She added: “I pray for you often, and I say that without excusing what he’s done. “I say that wholeheartedly from the depths of my soul. There’s been so much loss.” Asked by defense attorney Boyd Young whether she wanted mercy, she responded: “I do. I don’t say it lightly. He did not show my children mercy by any means, but my children loved him.” She then looked straight at Jones, a former Intel computer engineer, and said, “Nothing justies what you’ve done. There’s nothing you could possibly say to justy what you’ve done to my babies.” At an earlier hearing, Amber collapsed screaming as devastating details emerged. It is being described as one of the most horric murder cases in the state’s history.   The judge at at Lexington County Court halted the case as the distraught mum screamed and cried before being helped from the floor as the jury asked to leave the room, reports The Post and Courier .She shouted: My babies, my babies. Oh God, Iaposm so sorry. I miss my babies, I want my babies. Iaposm so sorry, Iaposm so sorry. They are my babies, they should still be here. The trial had heard how Jones had received custody of the five children after the couple orced. Amber previously explained how she felt it was the right decision as at the time as she didnapost have a job or a car. She saw the children every Saturday at a Chick-fil-A restaurant.    She said in court: I did not want him to be a primary caregiver, but he was the better provider I thought I was making the best decision I could as a mother. Jones, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, said in a police recording previously played to jurors that he accidentally killed Nahtahn by making him do an excessive number of push-ups and squats for an hour. He then deliberately strangled the others. He used a belt to choke the youngest two because his hands were too big, according to prosecutors. A coroner told the court how the dumped childrenaposs bodies had been found in a state of decomposition. He described to  jurors chosen for the case how two of the bodies had been attacked by animals and another showed signs someone had tried to remove one of the childrenaposs legs.    Amber also read out a letter in court that she had written to eight-year-old Mereh, explaining why the couple, who met in  while working at a Chicago theme park, were living separately. In it, the heartbroken mum said: Merah, my sweet, sweet daughter, I know that your heart feels heavy and you feel really sad. I want to reassure you, sweetheart, that you along with your brothers and sister mean everything to me. Mommy and Daddy were very blessed ...” An earlier hearing heard that the last words Merah to her father before he killed her were: Daddy, I love you, authorities claim. Merah was said to have witnessed the cold-blooded killing of her younger brother Elias. Testying during the trial in Lexington County, which began May , US media reports FBI Agent David Mackey said: Next he goes to his daughter, Merah Gracie and he kills her in the same manner.    According to Mr Jones, before he strangled her, Merah said, ‘Daddy, I love you.’” After writing down a whole range of chilling plans to kill his kids - such as aposHead to campgroundapos, aposMelt bodiesapos and aposSaw  bones to dust or small pieces…sanitation plantapos - the murderer finally buried the bodies on a rural hillside near Camden, Alabama. The court heard Jones was arrested at a drink-driving checkpoint in Smith County, Mississippi, on September ,  after police smelled a terrible odour they described as the smell of death. During a search of the Cadillac Escalade car, police found a bucket of chemicals, blood, maggots and children’s clothes.Jones was recorded saying: A voice says, aposWhy donapost you burn the bodies apos Another voice says, aposWhy donapost you cut them up and feed them to hogs apos Another said, aposWhy donapost you put them in concrete apos, Fox News reports .The hearing continues.

Cody Kennedy was driving with friends in Twentynine Palms in Calornia when he spotted something slithering through the sky. The -year-old, who had hoped to capture some reptiles for his animal-themed YouTube channel, said: Me and a couple friends were driving around the desert looking for rattlesnakes. In the desert at night, rattlesnakes will come up on to the roads while they are looking for food and mates, and I like to drive around looking for them.    But he and his friends were left baffled when they saw a moving bright long bar in the sky on their way back. He thought someone was shining a light on the bottom of a flag, but the light was too high to have been coming from the ground.His video footage shows the UFO resembling a worm squirming in the night sky, illuminating in white but with patches of black rippling along its body.   Cody, from Palm Springs, said the scene lasted about  minutes before it hurtled to the ground and vanished. He added: We saw it come to the ground in the middle of the desert. We all ran out to it but didnapost find anything. Some people suggested to him that it could have been a balloon or a drone with an LED light bar. He said: I think maybe it was the tail of a kite that has some kind of LEDs but I have looked online for something like it and canapost find anything.  “Andit was a kite, where was the person holding it  Also there were powerlines there too, so kite flying at night would be dangerous.” As for the possibility of something extra-terrestrial, Cody is keeping an open mind. “I want to believe, he said. “I just need some evidence now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shower shields here case you","story":"NewsShower shields are here in case you dont want to ruin your make-up or lashesTheyre also handyyouve had facial surgery eyelash extensions or microbladed browsShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  JUN NewsDo you know someone who needs one of these  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Itaposs a tale as old as time Youaposve just applied your make-up , when, for whatever reason, you need to jump in the shower.Maybe youaposve realised your hair has gone just that little bit too long between washes, or perhaps you simply fancy a hose-down.Whatever your motivations, thereaposs now a product which means you can shower and keep your slap intact.

Brittany Zamora, , could be jailed for up to  years after pleading guilty to sexual conduct with a minor, attempted molestation of a minor and public sexual indecency  in Goodyear, Arizona. The -year-old sixth grade teacher at Las Brias Academy was arrested in March last year after the teenaposs parents discovered a string of messages from her. In one of the texts, she told the child he gets sexier to me every day and I want you every day with no time limit. Zamora, who joined the school a year before the allegations surfaced, first made contact with the boy outside school through the schoolaposs own educational social media app, prosecutors say.  She used a programme called Classcraft to talk to her victim as well as other students from the school. She then allegedly had several meetings with the boy - including in her classroom as another student acted as lookout. A court heard the pair also sexually touched each other while other pupils were watching a video in class. On one occasion, Zamora drove to the boyaposs grandparentsapos house to have sex in her car while her husband was away fishing, according to court documents. She also allegedly sent the boy naked photos of herself and photos of her in lingerie. The boy wrote the married teacher love letters on sticky notes - including one that read: You are sexy - in , police said.  Zamora allegedly had sex with the teen at least four times between February  and March  last year. After one alleged encounter, the boy reportedly messaged her asking to sleep with her again. Zamora allegedly responded: I know baby! I want you every day with no time limit. If I could quit my job andyou all day long, I would. Some students at the school said they thought Zamora and her victim were dating. A boy, who claimed to have seen the teacher molest the boy, said: It’s, like weird how a -year-old can, like, love a -year-old and do stuff. It’s just crazy. She’s not a good person.  Another pupil told Principal Tom Dickey: Everyone talks about them having an inappropriate relationship outside of class and at recess. Iaposve heard other kids in my class say that they think they are dating. Zamora reportedly offered to resign in a phone call with the boyaposs parents after the messages were discovered. She allegedly told them: I don’t want to say stuff and have me recorded right now and bring this to court and have me go to jail for the rest of my le. The victimaposs parents are now suing Liberty Elementary School District for £.million in damages, claiming the school did not do enough to protect their son, according to the lawsuit filed to Maricopa County Superior Court. Zamora pleaded guilty to sexual conduct with a minor, attempted molestation of a minor and public sexual indecency and will be sentenced on July .

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argylls got talent","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn exciting celebration of the creativity and talents of Mid Argyll young people will be on show at two fantastic events on Saturday June .In the afternoon, Lochgilphead High School’s final matinée performance of Romeo and Juliet will take place at .pm at the Joint Campus.

Gladstone of Galashiels Pte Harry Carruthers son of Henry and Mary Carruthers of Galashiels and Pte M H Crosier Hawick were all killed during the D-Day landings.The Normandy Invasion started at .am on June , .James Gray, along with Jimmy Mills and George Coltman, who were work colleagues at John McQueen  Son Ltd, volunteered in , as did many others from across the Borders.Initially serving in the th Battalion, after being selected for Officer Training, Gray was posted to the st Battalion.The following are notes from the personal records of the late Major James Gray M.C. Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

South East Scotland Transport Partnership , the project centres around three main messages.Do The Ride Thing promotes good cycling manners, cycling as a positive travel choice and how easy electric bikes make cycling.TweedLove and the Tweeddale area benefit from an off-road path linking the Tweed Valley towns of Peebles, Innerleithen and Walkerburn.With the path being so popular with many users including cyclists, walkers, runners and horse-riders, Do The Ride Thing sets out to encourage good cycling manners when using the path, and cycling in general, to ensure all users feel safe and comfortable.At TweedLoversquos annual event the GO e-bike Family Ride, supported by Frog Bikes, all participants will be provided with a Do The Ride Thing bike bell.This aims to encourage the message of good cycling manners on the path and negate the problem of cyclists approaching other users at speed with no warning.A small gesture which will hopefully have a huge benefit to the users of the multi-use path.Hillside Outside created TweedLove to encourages cycling as a mode of transport, on any sort of bike, and showcases the ease of using the Tweed Valley Railway Path.Harley Lothian, Hillside Outside, said: ldquoIt is well-known that adopting cycling as a mode of transport provides many benefits from improved physical and mental health to positive environmental impacts, and it has recently become much easier with the introduction of electric bikes.ldquoTweeddale benefits from its own GO e-bike hub based in Innerleithen to provide the local community access to electric bikes for personal use.ldquoAnd electric cargo bikes for the business community, making it easier to adopt cycling as a transport method in the Tweed Valley.ldquoDo The Ride Thing will continue to promote these messages through a number of dferent avenues over the next few months.Participation is free for the Family Ride event, which will take participants on a journey along the Tweed Valley Railway path departing from Tweed Green on Sunday June  at .am.Full details can be found at tweedlove.More information on the Do The Ride Thing project visit dotheridethingAnd for more information on GO e-Bike

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

inquiry was launched by the committee to explore how social security support for housing costs is impacted by welfare reform, with a particular focus on the local housing allowance and Universal Credit housing costs.In its report, the committee stated that it was \"alarmed\" by evidence which indicated increasing rent arrears under UC.Referring to a submission by Citizens Advice Scotland , the committee noted that CAS stated that in the last  months, their clients rent arrears issues were predominantly caused by them moving onto UC and experiencing problems with the delivery of support to pay the rent through the new benefit.:Less than half of Universal Credit claimants have rent paid directly to landlordsThe committee noted evidence from Scotlands CAB network, as well as from other stakeholders, which suggested that the incidence of rent arrears is far higher amongst tenants receiving UC.In data produced by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities , referenced in the report, it was also outlined that mainstream rent arrears for four local authoritieshad increased by a total of % in the two-year period from March , .The report stated: \"COSLA acknowledged that increased

I suspect Michael Gove, who is as sharp as a tack, knew perfectly well how his ambiguous remark would be received.It was designed to distract press attention from his cocaine confessions.Evenit wasnrsquot a sexual allusion, it was still astonishing to hear the politician who famously stabbed Boris Johnson in the back in the  Tory leadership contest wielding the stiletto again.:Ruth Davidson told her MPs must block Boris Johnsons tax planMr Johnson has his chance to retaliate today as he finally launches his leadership campaign. But hersquoll have a hard job getting a word in as he is relentlessly challenged on his moral fitness for office.Expect every one of his lies, affairs, broken promises and his cocaine use to be exposed. How he allegedly connived in the assault of a journalist was sacked by the Times for fabricating stories made offensive remarks about Muslims. Remember that  interview in which the former BBC presenter, Eddie Mair, called him ldquoa nasty piece of work.Mind you, hersquos not alone. Irsquove lost count of the number of Tory leadership candidates whorsquove admitted to using drugs. Wersquove had Jeremy Hunt talking about reducing the abortion limit to  weeks Esther McVeyrsquos contretemps with TVrsquos Lorraine Kelly and, of course, all those magic formulas for unlocking Brexit. Itrsquos not so much a horse race as an unruly herd of unicorns trying to trip each other up.Boris Johnson still leads by a horn, and is most favoured by the Tory membership. But today hersquoll collide with reality as the media shred his proposal to hand up to pound, in tax cuts to people earning up to pound,. His Tory colleagues have already set the scene.Dominic Raab, the Thatcherite ex-Brexit Secretary, said the giveaway would paint the Tories as ldquothe party of privilege. Andrea Leadsom said the cuts would be ldquounworkable. Rory Stewart called them ldquoeye-watering. In fact, about the only thing Tory candidates agree on is that Mr Johnsonrsquos fiscal policies are rubbish.However, there is a progressive side to Mr Johnsonrsquos tax changes. Hersquos proposing to raise the threshold for the p tax band in England from pound, to pound,. But he is also calling for the cap on National Insurance contributions to be lted. At present, the NI burden is disproportionately laid on those earning the lower rate of tax, since itrsquos effectively frozen at  per cent for earnings above that. Successive Labour chancellors, since John Smith in the s, have tried to lt the NI cap, and failed because of the public outcry.However, this concession is more than outweighed by Mr Johnsonrsquos income tax bung to the well-off. At a time when the country is barely recovering from austerity, handing thousands to the top  per cent of earners makes little moral or economic sense. Far better to give it to the legions of workers whorsquove seen their pay frozen in the longest period of wage stagnation since the Napoleonic Wars. They at least will spend the money on goods in the high streets. The wealthy will bank it or buy property and shares.Not only would Mr Johnsonrsquos plans cement the Toriesrsquos reputation as the party of class privilege, they could also destroy the Union itself. Nicola Sturgeon has frozen the higher rate tax threshold to pound, and has no intention of raising it. This means that employees earning above that would, in Boris Johnsonrsquos regime, suffer a tax increase by paying more in National Insurance. The Scottish Parliament has no powers over NIcs.:Derek Mackay facing showdown with MSPs over poundbn lsquoblack holersquoPerhaps Mr Johnson thinks hersquos helping the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, by giving her stronger evidence for the ldquoSNPrsquos tax blitz on middle earners. But it is more likely to blow her up. The NI hike will be portrayed by the FM as an outrageous imposition on Scots: Borisrsquos poll tax.If it is ever implemented, that is. As this column has argued, nothing Mr Johnson says in this campaign should be regarded as a commitment. When he was London Mayor, he made a raft of promises on transport and congestion charging that never saw the light of day. Anyway, therersquos no way his tax cut agenda would get through parliament.The same goes for his promises on a No Deal Brexit. As rival Matt Hancock pointed out yesterday, hard Brexit will be stymied by MPs in the Commons. This is why Irsquove argued that Mr Johnson is the candidate most likely to implement Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal. Hersquoll sht focus to the subsequent trade negotiations, which have nothing to do with the Withdrawal Treaty, and promise to deliver a Canada-style free trade agreement.But he has to win first. Todayrsquos grilling will show just how hard that is going to be. The front runner rarely wins in Tory leadership contests, because the rivals will do just about anything, short of actual defamation, to undermine his or her chances. The briefing war starts today.This may explain why Mr Johnson launched his campaign, puzzlingly, with his unpopular tax give-away. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, this would be most rewarding for wealthy pensioners, who donrsquot pay National Insurance. The ,-odd Tory membership has an average age well above retirement. Itrsquos like a heat-seeking missile directed at the bank accounts of the Tory selectorate.Whisper it, but Mr Johnsonrsquos tax cut would also benefit employees whose salaries fall just below his new pound, threshold for higher rate tax. Like MPs and senior journalists on London papers. Irsquom sure that this will not for one-second figure in their minds as they decide which candidate is best suited to serve in Number ."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs-disgraceful-excesses-have-led-to-this-sorry-mess","story":"As the BBC announces that from June  it will end free TV licences for over-s who do not receive pension credit, nostalgia for the Beeb of old will be tinged not just with regret but a sense of betrayal.

A chorus of MPs cheered and applauded at all the right moments as the candidate rambled through his speech that denounced the nihilistic socialism of Jeremy Corbyn and held up the moderate, sensible, modern Conservatism, which he proudly espoused.Then came the tricky bit as the hacks prepared their questions, salivating at finally getting the chance to have a pot-shot at the submarine, which had finally surfaced.One question packaged some of the bad stuff, including how Mr J had offended people at home and abroad as Foreign Secretary, how he was cavalier with detail and how he had given mixed messages on Brexit.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"BrewDogs Inverurie bar\"  Neighbours object to BrewDog’s Inverurie pub hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses.

Barnes  Noble is the principal American book store company. They have over six hundred stores in the United States, and are a familiar presence in American shopping malls. For some years, though, they have not been doing as well as they might – a familiar story in book-selling. But now they have been acquired by the firm that already owns Waterstones, the UK’s largest book chain. Waterstones also used to have its problems,but then was itself bought by a Russian billionaire. He very wisely decided to appoint as its head a man who had a reputation for being able to sell books – James Daunt, who had built up a small string of highly-regarded book stores in London.James Daunt has the advantage in le – and business – of being one of the most agreeable people one could hope to meet. His approach was to make Waterstones bookshops friendlier, more locally-rooted places. This worked, and Waterstones recovered. Now he is going to New York to rescue Barnes  Noble on behalf of its new owner. He has said that he wants to make their stores nicer. He will probably do just that. If you want to make a business nice, the first step is to install a nice person at the top. But it won’t be easy. This is a story that has a major competitor in the wings, a company to which – and we may as well admit it – we all turn to buy everything from light bulbs to crushed flax seed, shoelaces to … books. It is very simple, and it is cheap. Light bulbs and the like may look after themselves, as their cultural implications are slight , but books are a very dferent matter. If book shops disappear because of the ease with which a website allows one-click transactions, then we shall all be immeasurably poorer. These shops are not just any old store, they are book shops – where words and ideas are laid out for us to explore.Buying a book online is undoubtedly convenient, and there is a place for it, but it does weaken the whole edice of book publication. First and foremost, it concentrates an immense amount of book selling power in the hands of a single provider, even , in theory, anybody can sell a book on line. That means that publishers might be required to give the on-line store deep discounts, and that, of course, means they will feel inclined to publish popular titles that will sell in vast numbers. Poetry, essays, and the like may not get a look-in.But it does more than that. When real bricks and mortar booksellers disappear we are denied the chance to browse. How many times do we enter a bookshop and discover an author we’ve never heard of, or a book that we would never have thought existed but that we feel we would like to read  In a real shop, you can start a le-time love affair with the works of a newly-discovered author, obscure or well-known.Bookshops are having a tough time of it, but the situation in Scotland is alleviated by the tenacity and dedication of many of our independent booksellers. These may be crop up in surprising places. One of the most applauded bookshops in Scotland is in a small Borders town – St Boswells, not a place with a very large population. It was here that Ros de la Hay, a former publisher, and her husband, Bill, set up their Main Street Trading Company. They have now added a deli to their offering, so that people can buy books, sample and purchase salami, and have a cup of coffee all at the same time . Main Street Trading was named Britain’s Best Small Shop in .Similar awards have been won further north, by the Watermill Bookshop in Pitlochry, where Jayne and Kevin Ramage have been enticing Perthshire people into buying books for some years. In St Andrews, Robert Topping, a highly regarded bookseller who has well-loved shops in England, in Ely and Bath, established a bookshop a few years ago. He hand-picks the books they stock in this bibliophile’s heaven. He will shortly be opening a new store in Edinburgh, joining booksellers such as Marie Moser, who runs Holy Corner’s gem, the Edinburgh Bookshop. These people are heroes and heroines of the book.These local bookshops, intimate in scale in an age of the big and the characterless, are little fortresses dedicated to defending an artefact that survives because we love it so much – the book. Electronic books are all very well, but you can’t touch the text you can’t smell the paper you can’t put it on a shelf to remind you of what it says you can’t wrap it up and give it as a present you can’t kiss its cover in gratitude. Actual bookshops survive because we love the physicality of the book – and want a real, physical existence rather than a virtual one. Still.

Here, in a town trademarked by its cantilever cranes and red-bricked rows of warehouses, nature reasserts her authority as the yawning expanse of the Firth of Clyde is foreshadowed by Gourock and framed by the rolling hills of Kilcreggan and Dunoon. It is an outlook which only improves during the summer months, and not on account of the erratic west coast weather the enhancement is provided entirely by the reassuring sight of the Waverley’s raked twin funnels coming into view, as she chugs down past the Tail O’ The Bank. From a distance, she appears a mere speck in the Clyde’s dull leaden-blue waters, almost insignicant against the grand canvas provided by Tom na h-Airidh and Ben Bowie. Yet all it takes for the roles to be reversed is a simple change of perspective. Stepping aboard the Waverley is to enter a world of sensory delights, a world which renders all outside it small and insignicant. Vast piston rods and cranks chatter away in unison, thrumming deep below right up against the soles of your feet. Above deck, a churn of gulls hangs expectantly over a comforting fug of hot oil and cold beer. She reserves the best, however, for when she is in full flow, as the unrelenting rhythm of her paddles scoop through the sea, an unstoppable force of industrial ingenuity thrashing ever forward through the years. Or so we hoped. The world’s last seagoing paddle steamer has been a fondly received visitor to communities scattered throughout Scotland’s western waterways for decades. When Caledonian MacBraynesensed that the days of folk heading “doon the watter” were numbered, they sold her in  for £to the Scottish branch of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. No doubt there are some within CalMac who came to regret that decision, but equally, it would be a mistake to mock them for some perceived folly. The Waverley had lost several sailing days the previous two summer season to boiler problems, and the commercial case for her continued service was increasingly dficult to justy. CalMac, mindful of the ship’s heritage, presumed the society would tend to her in her dotage as a static attraction. Here we are, some  years and six million passengers later. The question in  is, having performed one resurrection, can she repeat the trick The boiler problems which troubled the grand old lady back then, and sporadically ever since,are now altogether more grave. The inner casings of the vast, oil-filled structures are damaged beyond repair. Their replacement is a process the steamship’s custodians liken to “open heart surgery,” and it will be expensive to boot. Waverley Steam Navigation Co Ltd, the charity set up to preserve the ship in operating condition, is hoping to raise £ million so that she canto service next summer. As Paul Semple, the general manager, concedes, it will be a “signicant struggle”. And yet for all the strain of the annual upkeep costs in the face of rising fuel costs and a stricter regulatory environment, there is undoubtedly a sound economic argument to ensure the Waverley stays afloat for years to come. The charity points out that the Waverley’s visits throughout Scotland, as well as to England and Wales, generates more than £.m for the UK economy each year. It is an impressive figure, and its real value lies in where the money goes. By virtue of the Waverley’s long-established routes to Scotland’s islands and sea lochs, she and her patrons call at small, rural communities which once thrummed with activity in their Victorian summer heydays. The Waverley alone cannot turn back the clock and fully restore their lustre, but when she arrives at one their piers teeming with  hungry and thirsty punters onboard, it is a cheering sight for local businesses. Just ask the staff in the Golfers, one of Rothesay’s great wee howffs, who can barely pull pints quickly enough to meet the demand as the tourists come ashore or those in the bustling Zaoni’s chippy, just a hop, skip, and stagger away from the boozer — ideal for those Waverley apostles in pursuit of the last fish supper before their beloved steamer sets sail for Glasgow. Of course, there are some who believe the Waverley’s proud heritage could be preserved without the expense and exertion of rendering her seaworthy once more. Those who envisage her as a floating visitor attraction would do well to look to Calornia, where the Queen Mary has been allowed to fester and decay under the watch of reckless municipal landlords. But the argument for permanently mooring the Waverley is built on deeper fault lines. It singularly fails to acknowledge how the only reason the ship is still with us at all is due to the hard work of generations of impassioned volunteers who simply refused to countenance the idea that the blast of her steam whistle would fall silent..We can, and should, rattle some cages to save an icon of Scotland’s maritime heritage, but it is a battle that will be easier won by remembering the Waverley is no museum piece. Her beauty lies in her . She wears her blood, sweat, and oil with pride.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps reject labour plan for no deal vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Commons opposed the move by  votes to  - a majority of .window.twttr The effort had been lodged by Labour and Tory rebels in a bid to take control of Parliaments timetable.: Nicola Sturgeon brands Ruth Davidson lsquoout of touchrsquo with Scots over Javid backingIf passed, it would have given opponents of a no-deal Brexit the chance to table legislation to thwart the UK leaving without any agreement on the  October deadline.The result of the vote was greeted with cheers from the Tory benches.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded by shouting \"you wont be cheering in September\".SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has described Scottish independence as Scotlands \"way out\" after MPs failed in their Commons bid to block a no-deal Brexit by the next prime minister.\"Motion in Parliament that would have began the process to stop a no deal Brexit has fallen,\" Mr Blackford tweeted.\"The risks of no deal are increasing.

What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Still thinking about it, Malc Not at all Brian.There’s nothing to think about.I replied to you immediately but I forgot to gentry my working-class language, so it wasn’t published.The Lib Dems in London and the SNP in Scotland had a very similar policy on Article  and EU membership.The SNP had clearly planned their strategy well in advance and provided clear guidance to their supporters who knew exactly what they were voting for.Why did that make you swear Stop fishing Brian.I would never swear at you.I merely referred to the Brexitiers in language that was a trle unrefined.@MHJ, Like you, I replied immediately and my comment was withheld, although, notI may say, due to foul language. You clearly misunderstood my point, which related to democracy.Clarity is a desirable quality of communication, in itself, neutral. As opposed to democracy, which is a fundamental principle by which we live and are governed.John.Firstly, I neither swore nor used “foul” language.I just failed to prissy it up to the required standard.I didn’t say anything you wouldn’t hear in a nursery playground. Secondly.I did understand what you said but you clearly didn’t understand it yourself.In your example, a party was standing in what was essentially a single-issue election and stated its policy with clarity and precision.Given these very specic factors, under what circumstances would this party be elected by voters who did not support the policy In order to justy your “honouring, then ignoring the plebs” insult, you created a  scenario.Incidentally.It shouldn’t make any dference but when I replied to your comment, I had no party axe to grind.No, Malcolm, it is you, not I, who fail to understand. My point referred to the LibDems conduct during and after the EU referendum # #People#s Vote# # of  June . The recent EU election is merely the latest episode.The Remain-supporting UK government sent a £ million, taxpayer funded leaflet to every UK home, recommending Remain and stating # in big, bold type # that this was a #once in a generation# event, adding, #The government will implement whatever you decide.#No party dissented. Indeed, Nick Clegg repeated it forcefully in a nationwide tv debate .The next day, LibDems leader Tim Farron furiously rejected the outcome . Since then, the LibDems, and others, have campaigned ferociously to reverse the result.They have traipsed around Brussels, encouraging EU negotiators while undermining our own, effectively, #colluding with a foreign power# to wreck Brexit. And all the while demanding a second referendum in which the people would be frightened into voting Remain by the unpalatable EU offer that they helped to ensure.I am unable to recognise that as in any way democratic.John,The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. The Liberals adopted a pro-European stance in the  advisory referendum as did the Lib Dems in the  advisory referendum.They also presented pro-European policies in all the national and European elections between those dates and up to the present.Their MPs and MEPs have been consistently elected by pro-European voters who expect them to stick to their pro-European election manestoes.There are countless dferent types of constitutional democracies around the World and they are all slightly dferent.If you watch events in the House of Commons, you will notice that there are neat rows of benches provided opposite the government’s benches.They have been there for hundreds of years and they are there for a very special reason.They exist because, in our form of constitutional democracy, the losing side is allowedto continue developing and promoting the positions set out in its own manestoes.The losing parties do this in direct opposition to the policies of the government who were elected by the majority.That is why the losing parties are called “The Opposition” and their existence is not something that contradicts democracy but is, in fact, an essential part of it.You can’t expect the opposition parties to take a vow of silence just because someone put a leaflet through your letterbox in .#The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. #But the least they should do is respect the result, not demand it is overturned.Ok., Malcolm, I seem to be having dficulty making it through the editorial filter so I#ll have to agree to disagree. Neither have I #a party axe to grind.#Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"total rematch for a night in november","story":"AUGUST  and the curtain came up on Marie Jones’ A Night in November, making its theatrical debut as part of Féile an Phobail.  years on and the play is back, detailing one man’s struggle with identity at the Lyric Theatre.The play charts the story of welfare clerk Kenneth McAllister, a Protestant who has always followed the rules and has “cleanly discriminated” against Catholics throughout his le. This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion.

news northern-ireland article.ece cb AUTOCROP h bpanews_eaef-cb--aec-abdd_embeddedEmailThe sheer scale of the problems facing Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been laid bare in a new report.Commissioned by the Department for the Economy, it warns that businesses here would be left with \"limited room for manoeuvre\" should the UK leave without an agreement.The report, compiled by EU customs and international trade lawyers, provides a \"sobering reflection\" on the issues that would arise for cross-border trade.\"In particular, it confirms the Northern Ireland Civil Services concern about the impact of EU tarfs on food exports toIreland, and the ability of micro and small enterprises with no experience in customs procedures and operations to continue to export to Ireland,\" a cover note to the report said.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will cease to have a legal or regulatory framework in which to trade with the EU.It will instead fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, meaning UK-EU trade would suddenly be subject to tarfs on some goods and new disruptive non-tarf barriers, resulting in a logistical nightmare.In  over % of businesses here that exported to the rest of the EU were trading across the border.The total value of this trade was £.bn, which represented % of all exports and % of external sales, which includes sales to Britain.In  imports from the Republic totalled £.bn while % of all local businesses exporting south of the border are micro or small enterprises, which would be hit hard by no-deal.Among the recommendations, the report suggests negotiations could be commenced to establish joint Republic of Ireland Northern Ireland customs offices in each others territory.\"If an integrated logistics centre customs office is established, the joint customs office can also be located there, thus signicantly increasing efficiency,\" the report said.\"UK Government should concentrate on developing and implementing its own single window for lodging all import, export and transit requirements and should enter into consultation with the Republic in its efforts to establish its own.\"The medium-term objective should be to create as much efficiency as possible on each side of the border by aligning the single windows in their presentation and ality, thus signicantly increasing efficiency.\"Even with that, there would be further complications depending on what type of goods, livestock, food are being exported or imported.The report also looked at the potential for establishing logistics centres where integrated customs and technology dealing with commercial traffic could be installed, though it warned this would be a long-term project and would be extremely costly to both sides of the border.\"Technological solutions, in so far as they exist, can help to speed the clearance process,\" the report added.\"Consideration could be given to the financial burdens small SMEs in particular will incurthey need to acquire the equipment for such solutions.\"Lorries or containers of such traders could be made identiable by number plate recognition or a tracking device.\"Another recommendation is that the UK could grant waivers or reductions in time-limits for lodging declarations for low-risk products crossing the border, which would be helpful for deliveries on short notice.\"It can be expected that traders will find the rules and procedures to be extremely complex and confusing,\" it added.\"The administrative effort on the part of the UK authorities or authorised bodies to issue certicates, licences etc. will be signicant and likely result in delays.\"The department also warned that the creation of a hard customs border \"could jeopardise the peace which has been established by the Belfast Agreement and the Common Travel Area\".\"However, there is nothing to prevent co-ordinated action between the UK and the EU RoI to protect respective and or mutual security interests,\" it said."},{"url":null,"title":"mps reject bid to block nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

She was also the founder of the human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights-a group that supported disadvantaged groups which she continued to advise until her death.Inez Murphy was born into the Protestant tradition in Cultra, County Down in September,  and after her initial studies won a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at -years-old whilst working towards her A levels at night.At this tender age the budding champion of trade unionism didn’t fully appreciate what was actually happening in Northern Ireland and later recalled: “I was a puzzled young Prod. Until I was , I hadn’t knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn’t understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and ision in our society.”Inez McCormack’s first contact with Derry came in the years - when she attended Magee College. It was the era when the decision to locate Northern Ireland’s second university at Coleraine. The experience provided her with her first taste of ‘street politics’ and an initial glimpse at how power was abused. Between - she attended Trinity College in Dublin and it was there that she met Vincent McCormack.The pair married within three months of meeting and as her husband was a founding member of the Derry Labour Party, when they ed to Derry Inez had a first-hand insight of the growing Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. She was on the People’s Democracy march that was attacked at Burntollet by loyalists as it approached Derry in January,  and later described the era as “living through a historical defining moment.”Later in , having begun to study for a Diploma in Social Studies Inez McCormack began a career as a social worker in Ballymurphy, in . The West Belfast housing estate, ravaged by the Troubles also suffered great levels of social deprivation and in the midst of that an attempt was made to shut the Social Services office down and the workers were to be moved to a dferent area.Realising the need for them to stay the workers refused to leave Ballymurphy and they were advised to join a trade union to help them resist the pressure to go. Inez McCormack contacted the National Union of Public Employeesand all the workers were accepted as member with Inez acting as shop steward. By , she was working part-time for the union.NUPE would eventually become UNISON and in , Inez McCormack became the first female full-time official with the daunting task of achieving , members in the first five months of her employment.Realising that part-time women workers in the public sector were normally dismissed as ‘too dficult to organise’ and so weren’t part of a union, Inez McCormack began the process of signing them up.She said: “My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody.\"By the time UNISON was formed in  Inez had increased the union’s membership from  to ,. She went in to become the union’s first woman regional secretary and continued to represent low-paid women cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. Between - she was the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU and became its first woman president in .Inez McCormack’s achievements were all the more remarkable coming as they did in a very male dominated world. But those achievements did not come lightly.\"At one meeting I was booed off the  and called scum. I was talking about child care and was told that it shouldnt be on a trade union agenda.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“To those \"inclined to take a stand against inequality or the abuse of human rights\", McCormack asserted that \"the fallout for the inidual can sometimes be brutal, but it is emphatically worth it,” she said.She was also a signatory to the MacBride Principles for fair employment, and succeeded in galvanising Irish-American opinion to combat the early unpopular reception to the Principles in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in , and brought the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in the North.In the build-up to the  Belfast Agreement saw the adopted Derry woman running a brilliant campaign to have equality and human rights provisions included. Inez McCormack viewed this as being key to conflict resolution founded on the practice of justice.She saw that those most affected by violence in the North came from the most socially deprived communities. So, Inez McCormack’s campaign asserted the rights of the most socially excluded and she said: “Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions. I argue that a lot of the social problems come because the economy is built in a way that excludes people rather than includes.”The next landmark in Inez McCormack’s long list of achievements came in  when she set up participation and Practice of Rights . This is a Belfast group which supports marginalised groups in using a practical and unique human rights-based approach to tackle the social and economic challenges they experience. Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as \"ground breaking,\" saying, \"They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive sense of rights and dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application where.”McCormack was a founding member of the Vital Voices Global Advisory Council, and honoured in  at Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in recognition of her contributions as a human rights advocate. The international organisation supports and invests in emerging women leaders in harnessing their potential to bring about peace and prosperity in their communities.She was also appointed in  by the Irish government as the independent chair of a consultative process to develop an Irish National Action Plan to meet government obligations under the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.McCormack received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate from Queens University Belfast in  for her services to human rights and the community. She received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from New York City in , the Aisling Person of the Year Community Award in , and the Irish Tatler Women of the Year Award in .McCormack was also a well-known writer and broadcaster, and her work has been featured in a number of television programmes and documentaries. Numerous articles by McCormack on the theme of underpinning building peace and prosperity by inclusive socio-economic strategies have been published in recent years, and some of her work was included in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing .McCormacks career was featured in the  American documentary play Seven. The play, developed by Vital Voices, spotlights seven women from across the world that have overcame obstacles to bring major changes in their home countries. Meryl Streep portrayed McCormack. When the women portrayed were asked to come on stage and stand beside their onstage likenesses, Streep stated that she \"felt slight\" while standing beside McCormack, adding, \"Im an actress and she is the real deal.\"In , Newsweek named McCormack as one of its \" women who shake the world,\" the only Northern Irish woman to be named as such.The documentary, Inez McCormack: A Challenging Woman, produced and narrated by Susan McKay, won best short documentary award at the Galway Film Fleadh in .Inez McCormack had lived in Derry since . She passed away aged  in January  at the Foyle Hospice having fought bravely against cancer.

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive.

You entertained everybody and you knocked it through the roof.After the comments, Mark, who joked that no one had ever told him before he was too perfect, thanked all the people who had supported him and had helped give him this ldquophenomenal opportunity.Later on social media Mark said: ldquoThe dream is just to see my name above a theatre.I would love to be in the West End.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17690958.motion-on-pensions-turns-into-heated-debate-on-middle-east/resources/images/9559549.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South West College studying BTEC Level  Diploma in Business completed their final pitches last week in front of a  of lsquoDragonsrsquo.A Dragonsrsquo Den simulated task was the concluding element of a yearlong project that required them to develop inidual business ideas, conduct market research, and compose financial forecasts.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

It’s one of the areas that people have the lowest opinion of and the lowest expectations for. Duncairn Centres arts and events manager Ray Gfen“That’s the fuel in our tank, to change that and show how quality arts-led programming can impact that. It also lets the funders out there see the benefits of arts and creativity in changing society.”The arts centre is located in a predominantly nationalist area of the Antrim Road in the former Duncairn Presbyterian Church, which provides an inspiring backdrop for those within the building.This weekend will mark the second visit of RTE’s Other Voices to the centre. One of the highlights will be an acoustic performance to less than  competition winners from multi award-winning Northern Ireland band Snow Patrol on Saturday evening.The Duncairn Centre is run by the  Trust – a Christian community development group set up in . Presbyterian minister Rev Bill Shaw OBE has been the trust’s director since .Ray said: “We knew we had a good starting point in that Bill and the  Trust were highly respected here.“This is a long game. I’d say in the first year there would have been % coming from the PUL community, the rest would have been locals . “Just last year, it was up to around about -% from the PUL community. That was through programming, running specic events and targeting groups. Once we get people in to see what we’ve got they’re impressed.Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We carried out impact studies and one of the most interesting statistics we got was that % of people we surveyed from outside of the area who had attended just one event said that before the Duncairn Centre they would never have come to north Belfast.“This is why we’re here, to give people a reason to come to north Belfast, to create a shared space, to bring communities together.“This is a part of the city that has been starved artistically and creatively. We needed to go all in with this. I’m extremely proud of the work we’re doing here. We’re punching well above our weight.”He added: “Our organisation – the  Trust – is very much rooted in peace and reconciliation. “Both Bill and I are passionate about arts, and community building using arts and creativity as a vehicle to bring people together.“I think he and I are a good starting point. We come from completely dferent backgrounds.” Bill is a Presbyterian minister who was awarded an OBE for services to the community in north Belfast, while Ray comes from the nationalist community and from a family of musicians and music lovers.Ray said: “We get on extremely well. What lies at the heart of that relationship is that we love people and we want to give people a chance to shine.“We don’t ask people where they come from or what their political views are. “We are Belfast right to the very marrow of our bones. We love the city, the people, warts and all.”With the help of funding the Duncairn Centre has grown into a hub of music, arts and creativity hosting regular concerts, discussions and workshops led by artists in residence.Ray said: “A lot of what we do is about music. Music is the one thing that is relevant to everyone in every walk of le. It’s got the power to bring people together.“I look at the creative community as a moral compass because they think dferently, creatively, imaginatively, about how to overcome problems. Artists don’t really do barriers to collaboration, they celebrate dference.“We encourage discourse, but the one thing that is required is respect. Respect has to be earned through people’s actions and how they deal with each other.”Of the centre’s ethos Ray said: “We’re more than just an arts centre. It’s easy just to set a programme of classes. What makes us dferent is the thought, the follow up, the support, the empathy that underlies all of that. We’re conscious of mindfulness, community building, encouraging creativity and educating people. Then there’s purely and simply the enjoyment element – giving people a break.”try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

INLM-conShe said: “This report was commissioned to identy need following requests from our party, on behalf of the GAA community, for greater GAA provision in the Craigavon area. Our public spaces must be reflective of our entire population. The final recommendations fail to reflect the need clearly identied in the exercise.The GAA is the largest sporting organisation in our Borough yet in the Craigavon area ABC council provides  pitches for soccer and zero for GAA. The one pitch cited in the report as council-owned and suitable for GAA is located in Portadown, in a public park and open for use to a number of other sports. “As a council we rightly provide pitches to soccer, cricket, hockey and American football teams but in the Craigavon area we offer no provision to our huge GAA community. The GAA section of the report includes a continuous reference to Sport England and Rugby Football Union guidance which begs the question as to what consultation actually took place with the GAA.The failure to equality proof this policy is of major concern,” said Cllr Nelson who asked for the report to be pulled. She said she was ‘stunned’ when the SDLP proposed the recommendations be accepted. The strategy went through with the support of the SDLP, UUP, DUP and Alliance.”Craigavon SDLP Cllr Declan McAlinden said: “Sinn Fein put forward a proposal to have an Equality Impact Assessment on the council’s play pitch strategy after having sat for three years developing the proposal without once questioning the process.“Theirmotive is unknown but their proposal doesn’t have the support of the Ulster GAA council, local clubs or schools. In fact, their proposal would only have delayed the implementation of the plans, and potentially put at risk, the existing developments.”Doug Beattie MLA promoted to major in the Royal Irish

When the editors want to keep me happy they know to bring me a cup of Earl Grey tea. .pmResearch and development is the cornerstone of our company so daily catch ups are crucial with the team.  .pmI really need to unwind after a busy day and when I can I nip into a yoga class on my way home. I am truly terrible at yoga but I find it helps to just focus on myself for that hour. pmBack home it is checking home works and begging my elder son to revise for his A-levels. If I haven’t spoken to my daughter who is at university in Bristol, I will Facetime her. My husband tends to do the cooking during the week otherwise he knows he won’t get fed and although we eat healthy food there is often a glass of wine on the go.pmWe try to catch up on television shows that we need to be aware of across all the main channels.  pmThis is more indulgent time and my husband and I have a list of dramas that we stock pile, although I normally only last half an hour before falling asleep.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/almac_1.jpg","title":"almac sees turnover soar to m","story":"Posted on Monday June  by John Mulgrew Pharma giant Almac has seen its turnover soar to £m as its headcount rises by almost  in the last year.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
