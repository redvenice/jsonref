Sage advised a circuit-break in September but the Prime Minister delayed for weeks before acting.\u0027We had a tiered system that didn\u0027t work and then we had the debacle of the delayed decision to change the rules on mixing at Christmas.\u0027The most recent advice about the situation we\u0027re now in was given on December 22 but no action was taken for two weeks until Monday of this week. \u0027These are the decisions that have led us to the position we\u0027re now in – and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.\u0027 There is growing anger on the Tory backbenches over the Government\u0027s handling of the pandemic.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Middleton celebrates 39th birthday quiet tea party","story":"Share this articleLayer up in Kate\u0026#39s gilet by Really Wild ClothingClick to buy it now!No doubt you\u0026#39ll know by now that the Duchess of Cambridge likes to regularly recycle key pieces from her wardrobe.

Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Try not to panic, say experts, because retirement savings are long-term investmentsCovid-19 has turned the world upside down, sending Britain into its worst recession since records began. People may worry about what this means for their pension pot, wonder whether they can afford to save, or even consider raiding their retirement fund. What is the reality for pensions in a recession and how can you secure your future in uncertain times?Don’t panicSeamus Walsh, a pension guidance expert for Aviva, says that many people were spooked by the impact of the virus on stocks and shares earlier last year: “When big drops occurred in the markets back in March, some customers asked to switch funds. But ... things have been tracking upwards since.”Any panic may well be misguided as pensions are meant to be long-term investments that ride the highs and lows of stock markets. After the last financial crisis, pension funds recovered their losses when equities rebounded. This time round, while stock markets have been volatile since Covid-19 struck, news of potential vaccines has helped them, and pension funds, to recover lost ground.“Pensions investments are for the long term,” says Walsh. “The longer your money is invested, the longer it has to recover from any dips.”Where is your money? “People should know where their money is invested and be comfortable with the balance of their portfolio,” Walsh says. “Your pension provider can discuss your options. If you’re prepared to pay for advice, seek out a financial adviser.”While equities have had a volatile year, fluctuations should even out over time. Cautious investors may opt for a more balanced portfolio, with some money invested in cash or government bonds, which are regarded as a safe haven. Age is another factor – those nearing retirement may move more money into bonds as they will need to access their cash soon, while younger savers have more time to make up short-term losses.Choose the right pensionMany people struggle to understand pensions but given their importance, it’s worth spending time getting your head around the details. Final salary, also known as “defined benefit”, pensions are the gold standard, but many employers have moved away from providing such generous schemes that give a guaranteed retirement income. More common are defined contribution schemes where employees build up inidual pension pots through their contributions and those of their employer. They know what they are putting in, but the payout is less certain, as it depends on the performance of the markets and your pension provider in managing your fund.Under automatic enrolment, a government initiative to increase the number of people saving for retirement, employees are automatically signed up for the pension their employer offers. As long as you don’t opt out, you will make contributions alongside your employer, and receive tax relief on the money you pay in.Alistair McQueen, Aviva’s head of savings and retirement, says: “For employed iniduals, any money they pay in is boosted by their employer under automatic enrolment. They can’t access money until they are 55, but they do get money from their employer they wouldn’t otherwise receive.”Things are a bit different for people who are self-employed. They can pay into a personal pension set up with a provider of their choice or choose a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), which gives investors control over how money is invested. “Self-employed people should be aware of the boost a pension gives in tax relief,” says McQueen.An important source of income for most pensioners remains the state pension. For people who are uncertain how much they will receive and when, the government has an online calculator to give an accurate forecast, and help people plan ahead.McQueen adds: “From 55, you can access your pension, but there are implications for your retirement finances, plus tax issues if you take out a lump sum. Also, the amount you can save into a pension later may be affected. Seek help. You could turn to Pension Wise, the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service, Citizens Advice or your pensions providers’ support services.”Some people may feel they cannot afford pension payments if they are unemployed, furloughed or have seen earnings slump, but it is wise not to stop payments if you possibly can as this is likely to mean you have less to retire on. McQueen says: “Pension products are very flexible, allowing you to stop, start, increase and decrease contributions. Talk to your provider to make adjustments. Before you act, check a pensions calculator online to assess the long-term implications.”Why pension saving is usually a good ideaExperts insist there is no bad time to start a pension. And be reassured savings are protected by the Pensions Protection Fund. McQueen says: “All pensions are heavily regulated by government regulators. Iniduals also have recourse to the Pensions Ombudsman if they feel mistreated.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Global oil prices have climbed to 11-month highs of $55 a barrel with help from the Opec oil cartel.“Construction sites are some of the few areas of the economy that have remained open, and in places like China the government has been trying to stimulate that part of the economy,” Midgeley said.The fiscal stimulus plans outlined by countries – including the UK and the incoming Biden administration in the US – are likely to increase demand for metals and energy to build green infrastructure.“Things like copper, nickel and cobalt are all likely to see a boost from the extra demand to build infrastructure. Even steel and petrochemicals will be needed,” said Midgeley.A weaker US dollar, the currency used to trade most commodities, could allow prices to climb higher as demand grows.Mark Lewis, BNP Paribas’ global head of sustainability research, said: “I’ve been in financial markets for 30 years now and I have never seen anything like it. It feels like any market you look at, investors want to buy.”The next three decades are “likely to bring a supercycle in investments in clean energy infrastructure, clean transportation and everything else that is required to make the green transition possible”, he said.Higher fossil fuel market prices could increase the appetite for low-cost renewable energy which will be even cheaper by comparison as fossil fuel prices rise, Lewis added.Low-carbon energy will be even more economically attractive to major energy users in Europe thanks to record high prices for carbon permits on the EU’s emissions trading scheme, which reached €34.25 per tonne of CO2 for the first time last week.However, higher fossil fuel prices could also tempt major oil and gas companies to invest in lucrative new projects by inflating the profits of existing oil and gas portfolios in “one last party” for fossil fuels, he warned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2030d55219438fba0188fbcf74c026726ea6e925/0_211_5039_3023/master/5039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb610a25c9a0210c939b07b84109cfa1","title":"uk supermarket staff say they have become the forgotten key workers","story":"Employees face exhaustion, stress and abuse by members of the public in second coronavirus lockdownWhen the UK first went into lockdown last March, many supermarket workers said they had never felt so appreciated. Customers would thank them for their service, leave chocolates for the staff room and applaud delivery vans as if they were carrying royalty rather than groceries.Not any more, according to numerous store employees who contacted the  to express their fears and frustrations about working through the second wave. From debit card refuseniks pulling down their masks to lick their fingers and separate their twenties, to families treating a trip to the supermarket as a social outing, many felt they were now the “forgotten key workers”. Others feel taken for granted, suffering anxiety and panic attacks as a result of their work environment.“In lockdown one it felt a little embarrassing at times – people would wave, even stop and applaud as you went past as if you were a NHS worker. Now, it’s back to normal. Block a cul-de-sac for five minutes and you can expect abuse,” said Ben Harvey, who started delivering groceries for a supermarket in April after losing his job as a sales executive. “You want to tell them that you’re delivering essential supplies during a global pandemic and they shouldn’t even be out, but in your employer’s van and uniform you obviously just have to bite your tongue and suck it up.”Conspiracy theorists are making the job harder, said one worker from a small supermarket in the home counties. “The maskless hordes and the QAnon conspiracy spouters seem to grow by the day. Many don’t care, some are just ignorant but the most dangerous are those that think they’re following the rules. Customers who keep their distance from others, but crawl over shop staff to get their ‘essential’ Red Bull and loo roll, thanking them for everything they are doing from a mask pulled down to their chin to ‘help’ convey their message with sincerity and microdroplets of Covid-19.”The media seemed to have forgotten supermarket workers, he said: “Doctors and nurses are continually featured in the news (and rightly so), but there is very little mentioned about those who have worked throughout the pandemic and the toll this year has taken on them.“My mental health has been battered beyond belief and no matter what my behemoth employer says – there has been no consideration shown to the wellbeing and mental health of their staff. It has gone unchecked and unconsidered while we ring endless products through the non-socially distanced checkouts and stuff dirty cash into the ever expanding pockets of the shareholders and directors.”One home shopper working in Sussex said there had been an increase in people treating a trip to the supermarket as a day out or an excuse to socialise. “There are just far too many people who come in and wander around the shop because they don’t have anything else to do”, or whole families of six or more people,” she said.As a home shopper, she spends long shifts packing six bags at a time for online customers. “It may sound a bit dramatic, but we feel like we are literally putting our lives on the line, like any frontline worker, so that people can eat. If delivery and home shopping didn’t exist, people would have to go out.”A till worker in a supermarket in Scotland said mask etiquette was poor. “People get to my till, puffing away and moaning about ‘not being able to breathe’ even though they haven’t turned blue yet and are speaking clearly to me. They believe so much that they can’t breathe they pull the mask away from their mouths and down to their chin as if being at the till suddenly makes it safe to do this and Covid only goes as far as the till belt. Oh and let’s not forget the amount of old people and middle aged people who all pull their masks down, lick their fingers to give me cash because the ‘notes all stick together’.”The manager of one store in south-east England said several members of their team were suffering from anxiety and panic attacks as a result of customer behaviour. Mental health problems were being exacerbated by staff shortages, she said. “Most staff members are exhausted because colleagues are shieldingself isolating and so everyone else takes the strain because there is still a lot of work to do. On New Year’s Eve I overheard lots of customers talking about the secret partygatherings they were having and laughing about breaking the rules. It’s really hard to hear stuff like that, especially when they are not just putting their friends lives at risk, but ours too. It makes you feel so angry, actually and I often want to say something to them.”There was a bigger sense of comradeship before, she said. “People were doing their neighbours shopping and learning how to bake and cook etc. We were the only people that customers were seeing and we got to know them better. People would send us letters of thanks and care packages etc as key workers and we felt valued. All of the goodwill towards key workers seems to have vanished now. We feel exhausted, stressed and abused most of the time. It’s really hard to switch off too. But still we go back each day and keep filling the shelves to feed the nation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f1bb60bc87a3b2a54b550b24676cec7f93a0dd/0_4_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1ef1191e5ec2920e9c7e06ff9c15817","title":"school guidance for children of key workers changes again","story":"Pupils in England should not attend school if key worker parents can work from home, says DfEChildren of key workers should only attend school if their parents or carers cannot work from home, the government has said in yet another U-turn – after it previously expanded the offer of in-person school places in England to children who lack digital devices and quiet spaces in their homes.The Department for Education (DfE) updated its guidance for critical workers on Friday evening, and advised parents and carers of children who are eligible for a school place that they should keep them at home if at all possible.“Parents whose work is critical to the coronavirus (Covid-19) and EU transition response include those who work in health and social care and in other key sectors outlined in the following sections. Children with at least one parent or carer who is a critical worker can go to school or college if required, but parents and carers should keep their children at home if they can,” the DfE guidance now states.It comes after schools and teachers raised alarm over fears that schools could become overwhelmed amid worsening staff shortages and higher numbers of pupils attending school than during the first lockdown in spring.The survey by the Teacher Tapp app found that parents have been sending their children to school in increasing numbers, while headteachers have complained about their schools being “rammed” with pupils and about parents making implausible claims of being eligible “critical workers”.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, welcomed the government’s U-turn on school attendance of key worker children.“All of the latest statistics about number of cases and hospitalisation tells us that we have to do everything we can to cut the number of contacts that people have. Therefore we welcome the DfE statement that critical workers should keep their children at home if they can,” he said.“It is however regrettable that the DfE issues this statement at 5:30 on a Friday evening when it should have been made plain from first thing Tuesday morning. All of this will lead to further confusion for parents and for headteachers trying to manage education for key worker and vulnerable children.“The DfE has presumably issued this advice because of the number of children who have been present in primary schools this week, which has been far higher than during the lockdown in March.“The DfE should have been seeking to avoid this given that the Sage minutes from 22 December at paragraph 12 suggested there was concern that even with measures as stringent as last March, and with the new variant of the virus, the R rate might not be below one,” Courtney added.A DfE spokesperson said: “Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.“If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.“The protective measures that schools have been following throughout the autumn terms remain in place to help protect staff and students, while the national lockdown helps reduce transmission in the wider community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bce057b47ef61fb97cb7c4f9c132824bd7e8441b/0_154_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08dce8f5da60f09ea755879c3d653614","title":"glum future for the platypus why the elusive mammal is disappearing under our noses","story":"Scientists say the risk of local extinctions is rising due to damaged waterways, land clearing and climate changeIt is dusk beside a creek and we are instructed to look for a trail of bubbles, under which could be one of the world’s weirdest mammals.When you’re desperate to see a platypus in the fading light, everything looks like one.Floating logs from bank-side paperbark trees, gyrating leaves caught in a dance with the wind, and what was probably a water-rat dashing from rocks – they all make the heart briefly skip.But there’s no sign of the egg-laying, duck-billed, flat-tailed and venomous monotreme.We did not hack through tropical undergrowth or trek for hours to get here. We turned left at a tile shop and pub in the suburbs of northern Brisbane and parked 40 metres away from Kedron Brook on a side road.There are joggers and cyclists everywhere.Like many of Brisbane’s waterways, platypuses were once regularly seen here, but new research has found platypuses have likely gone from Kedron Brook and four other greater Brisbane waterways: the Bremer River, Scrubby Creek, Slacks Creek and Enoggera Creek.The last confirmed sighting at this exact spot was in 2002.A new study, in the journal Australian Mammalogy, is further evidence the once widespread mammal is in trouble in Australia – it’s only home on the planet.“It’s scary to think that we have already had these populations disappear under our noses,” Tamielle Brunt, lead author and a researcher at the University of Queensland, says.Brunt runs the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland’s PlatypusWatch network. In November, researchers at the University of New South Wales found the habitat for platypus had shrunk by almost a quarter in the past 30 years. The researchers joined conservationists to nominate the platypus for threatened species status.Platypuses are elusive. They’re nocturnal, skittish and tend not to make a literal splash. That makes them not only hard to see, but difficult to monitor.Brunt and her colleagues used a new environmental DNA sampling technique to check 28 rivers and creeks for platypuses. In 21 of the waterways, they had records of platypus sightings between 1990 and 2016.By analysing water samples for the DNA of platypuses (excreted mainly in poo and wee), researchers can tell if the animal is in the water without having to see them.“Because of how elusive they are, we could be losing them without knowing because we’re just not regularly monitoring them,” says Brunt.A lack of long-term platypus monitoring means that as land-clearing and regulation of rivers has altered their habitat, any decline could be going unnoticed.Australian coastal cities have grown relatively rapidly and in places such as Brisbane, platypus habitats of creek banks and waterways are now surrounded by busy suburbs.“The fact that in a 10 or 20-year timeframe they’ve gone out of some of these systems and that we’re seeing things only get worse with urbanisation and climate change – with all these impacts getting worse, it’s a glum future for the platypus.”Once gone from these suburban waterways, Brunt says it’s unlikely platypus could find their way back in.Dr Gilad Bino, a platypus researcher at the University of New South Wales Centre for Ecosystem Science, helped compile research that went to the Australian federal government to ask the platypus be listed as a vulnerable species.He says there are historic newspaper reports of people describing seeing “platypus migrations”, with dozens seen at once.“These days you’ll see one or two. Most Australians have never seen one,” he says. “That’s sad in a sense.”The platypus is known to exist from far north Queensland to Tasmania – a distance of about 2,900km (1,800 miles) – in freshwater rivers across a range of habitats from tropical to semi-arid, temperate and alpine areas.They’re a monotreme – an egg-laying mammal – and have an evolutionary history going back at least 120m years.Gilad says its modern-day threats are compounding. Water extraction from rivers and creeks, the building of dams and weirs that create obstacles, and river bank erosion from land clearing all have an impact.Platypuses need intact riverbanks, says Gilad, because it’s where they burrow and nest (platypuses don’t have a pouch, so the female will curl herself around the egg to keep it warm).Droughts that could be worsened by climate change affect the freshwater habitats, as waterways dry out or become too shallow.There’s also evidence, Gilad says, that the feral cats and foxes that litter Australia’s landscape can target platypus if their creeks become too dry and they have to move around above the water to find new places.He does think humans can “co-exist” with the platypus, and says there are still peri-urban areas in Melbourne – a city of five million people – where they are hanging on.The platypus is listed as endangered in South Australia and is recommended to threatened status in Victoria, as well as being nominated for a nationwide listing.Gilad hopes those attempts to get the platypus on threatened lists will prompt more widespread efforts to protect their waterways, and also promote greater levels of research and monitoring.He says the environmental DNA technique used for the Brisbane study is useful to say where platypuses exist, but it can’t say how healthy the population is.The future is challenging, but the game is certainly far from over for the species.“I don’t think the platypus is on the brink of extinction,” he says. “But as climate change progresses and all the other threats continue, it probably does mean the risk for local extinctions is increasing.“In some areas, platypus will go. That’s really unfortunate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce5f2171c19f7b9a345ad13ae84b37041a02120/0_402_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b153e4896d9d04f51fafdcf5cbb08a9f","title":"who doesnt love a turtle the teenage boys on a mission to rewild britain with reptiles","story":"At 17, they were meant to be taking their A-levels this year. But Harvey Tweats and Tom Whitehurst have a big ambition: to replace the toads, frogs and lizards we have lostThe new enterprise taking shape on a strip of derelict land beside a garden centre in Leek, Staffordshire, would be extraordinary at any time. But the large pond, greenhouses, cabins and homemade enclosures that will comprise this particular startup are positively miraculous given that it is driven by two 17-year-olds, both studying for their A-levels in the middle of a pandemic.Childhood friends Harvey Tweats and Tom Whitehurst are on a mission – to rewild Britain by restoring reptile and amphibian species that are either virtually extinct or have been extinct for centuries in this country. Their company, Celtic Reptile \u0026amp Amphibian, will soon open what the pair believe will be the country’s largest outdoor breeding facility for reptiles and amphibians. They hope it will be the first step in restoring lost species so that British ponds, lakes and wetlands once more resound to the croak of pool frogs and agile frogs as well as other once-common lizards and frogs. In the long term, Tweats and Whitehurst hope that the European pond turtle (which they source from Moldova) and the Aesculapian snake, already unofficially released in a couple of UK sites, may be embraced as new native species after being absent from the country for thousands of years.This may appear wildly ambitious – especially for a pair of school pupils – but they are knowledgable, passionate environmentalists, and they have secured the financial backing of leading rewilders, such as Ben Goldsmith (brother of the environment minister Zac Goldsmith), who has already supported efforts to reintroduce the beaver, and Charlie Burrell, the owner of the rewilded Knepp estate in West Sussex.It’s incredible, I enthuse, when Tweats, whose personable self-assurance makes him seem older than his years, and Whitehurst, who is quieter and in charge of the technical aspects of their operation, show me around their back-garden facilities via video. “It’s not incredible,” replies Tweats, laughing drily. “It’s really hard work.”That work includes building their new facility which, despite Covid-related delays, they are aiming to open for the spring breeding season. Their current operation is in their parents’ back gardens. In the sunniest corner of Tweats’s small suburban garden is a greenhouse and a tidy patio surrounded by large, open-topped plastic storage boxes. Inside each box grow plants that match the native habitat of the animals they are breeding. Tweats dips his hand into a small pond and gently picks out a moor frog. The dun-coloured amphibian crouches on his fingers, glistening in the sunlight. “This species is extinct in Britain but we want to bring it back,” he says. “It’s a male and it’s hibernating at the bottom of the pond, in a state of torpor.”In another enclosure, Tweats carefully pulls out a European pond turtle, a gorgeous small reptile which lives across mainland Europe. The turtles colonised Britain after the ice age, but are thought to have disappeared from the country after a period of climatic cooling. “Who doesn’t love a turtle?” says Tweats, beaming. “The fact that they can sleep under ice and were once native to Britain … Brilliant.”Tweats’s interest in frogs and lizards began when he was small. “It’s almost innate, as if it’s in your DNA to love nature,” he says. “My grandad was, and still is, a massive nature nut. He’s taught me all about the countryside, ecology, everything.” Tweats collected frogspawn and watched tadpoles become frogs. He reared butterfly and moth caterpillars, but his first captive breeding “on quite a large scale” was stick insects. “The babies would get out and climb all up the walls,” he says. He was nine when he got a tortoise, which helped him understand reptiles’ needs. Later, he kept exotic snakes, such as pythons.Every summer, Tweats and his family holidayed close to an area of lowland heathland in east Devon, the Pebblebed Heaths. One year he and his grandad attended an evening looking for nightjars – an elusive, nocturnal bird – and the wildlife warden, Ed Lagdon, impressed with Tweats’s enthusiasm, invited his family on a tour of the heath. Later, they kept in touch and, when a population of beavers was discovered on the nearby River Otter, Lagdon invited Tweats to do work experience on a trial to study the beavers’ impact in the valley.By now a teenager, Tweats had been inspired by George Monbiot’s book Feral. Working on the beaver project, “I had that lightbulb moment,” he says. “These beavers are creating incredible wetlands for amphibians and reptiles and yet they aren’t there because they went extinct so long ago.”During his work experience, Tweats saw how beavers are ecosystem engineers. By building dams, they create new wetlands for amphibians and reptiles but also dragonflies and other insects, and the birds and mammals that eat them. He now believes that many of Britain’s “missing” amphibians went extinct in medieval times – because the beaver was hunted to extinction.Tweats and Whitehead had begun breeding amphibians in earnest when they were revising together for their GCSEs. So was Whitehurst dragged along by Tweats’s enthusiasm? “You could say that,” says Whitehurst, laughing. He always enjoyed being outdoors in nature and admired Tweats’s passion. “When Harvey started keeping European green lizards, that made me go: ‘Hang on, this is something I want to be involved in.’ They were so stunning. Pythons are cool, but everybody’s seen them. When you realise these vibrant green lizards are a European species and you can actually keep them outdoors, that inspired me.“We suddenly thought: ‘If Harvey got some green lizards and I got some eyed lizards, why don’t we start a Facebook page and see what connections we can make?’” So the friends merged back garden breeding operations and posted pictures online. “It started to gain momentum and we eventually transformed it into a company,” says Whitehurst. One day, on the beaver trial, Tweats had a cup of tea with Derek Gow, an outspoken environmentalist known as Mr Beaver for masterminding beaver releases across Britain – and the talk turned to amphibians. “I said: ‘I breed them.’ And boom! There you go,” Tweats says. Suddenly, he realised that he could scale-up his hobby and contribute to big rewilding projects.Gow now sits on their advisory board and introduced Tweats and Whitehurst to financial backers, including Goldsmith and Burrell. This allowed them to rent a half-acre patch of ground 10 minutes’ walk from their homes for their new breeding facility.The friends are also, of course, in their final year of school, and are having to study from home. Like other students, their interrupted education has left them agonising over their final exams – which have now been cancelled – for months. “It’s just been an absolute nightmare,” admits Tweats. “We’ll be fine,” says Whitehurst. “We’ve got a lot of work to get on with so it kind of works in our favour.”The support of influential adults is vital, but what do their peers think? Loving wildlife was once the badge of a teenage nerd. “I do think that’s changing,” says Tweats. “Environmentalism is becoming almost sexy. I hate to use the term fashionable, because this isn’t just a Gucci handbag, this is something we really need to take seriously as stewards of the Earth. But it has become a bit more of a trend. Friends you would’ve never thought would be environmentally friendly are posting things on social media.”So fellow pupils never call them “newt boy” at school? “I am a people person and I’m very confident in social situations,” says Tweats. “I will make a joke about it and we’ll have a laugh, but overall it’s been incredibly positive. Maybe we’re lucky to be in a year group who are just so nice.”In fact, friends – bribed with bacon butties and beer – have dug the pond for their breeding centre. But what do their girlfriends or partners make of their mission? Do they even have time for girlfriends or partners? “No, we don’t,” says Whitehurst. “I wouldn’t say it gets in the way, but as 17-year-olds we’d much rather crack on with this, at least for a year or so, before we start looking for something serious.”Tweats and Whitehurst hope to become self-sustaining with revenue from breeding animals for sale to hobbyists and also making money from social media and providing animals for filming and photography. They are already earning sponsorship from their YouTube channel and one of their European pond turtles has appeared on Countryfile on BBC One.Ultimately, however, they want to breed thousands of amphibians and reptiles to support conservation programmes and bring back species including the pool frog, moor frog and the agile frog on Britain’s new beaver-created wetlands. And they are dismayed by the modest attempts made so far, such as returning the pool frog to a couple of pools in Norfolk.“If that’s the imagination we’re going to have, considering we’re in the sixth mass extinction, we may as well admit defeat,” says Tweats. “If we want to get this species back – and not just as a tick-box species so we can say ‘we’ve got the pool frog back’ – it needs to be in every single pond in the UK. End of.”Releasing 100 pool frogs is not rewilding, admits Tweats, “but restoring these amphibians could definitely fit into the jigsaw puzzle of rewilding”. While wolves or lynx capture the imagination of rewilding purists, the significance of smaller creatures is underestimated, he explains, citing a US study that found the weight of juvenile amphibians on 10 hectares of healthy marshland to be equivalent to a black rhino – and 1,400kg of amphibians in a marsh is a lot of food.“Although we think of amphibians as small, collectively they assemble into a massive superorganism that feeds so many species,” says Tweats. “People ask why do we want to bring back the pool frog or the moor frog or the agile frog? It’s simply food. All these different species inhabit slightly different niches in the ecosystem and open up the availability of food to many other species. If we want to bring back white storks at Knepp, then we’ve got to think about returning food to the landscape, as well as the inspiration and beauty that comes from these mini-dragons.”Despite supply-chain delays meaning their big new greenhouse will arrive months late, Tweats says they have encountered so much “wonderful” support over the past year. “The interest in these species has just been insane. They used to be completely vilified – toads were once seen as the spawn of witches. It’s come full circle and these animals are a symbol of hope and restoration.”I tell Tweats and Whitehurst they will soon be famous and constantly asked to name their favourite reptile or amphibian. They look pained at the prospect of choosing one. Tweats’s favourites include the sand lizard and European pond turtle Whitehurst loves eyed lizards (“they reach 90cm long, the largest mainland lizard in Europe”), common lizards (“the fact they give live birth, incubating the eggs inside them, is something that’s always fascinated me”) and tree frogs.“What about Gallotia goliath?” says Tweats. “It was a giant species of lizard that lived on the Canary Islands and it went extinct when the Conquistadors arrived. There are still remains, so there’s the potential to do a Jurassic Park-style resurrection on them.”“We’ll be at the forefront of that,” says Whitehurst with a gleam in his eye.“When we’re famous and we’ve got enough cash,” adds Tweats, laughing.Will the next Jurassic Park be found in Leek? I wouldn’t bet against it.1. Just add water and nature will come back. A pond – even a tiny one, from a washing-up bowl – will soon attract frogs and newts.2. Create hibernaculums (where animals can spend the winter) by leaving piles of logs or twigs underneath hedges or in garden corners.3. Leave your lawn to grow wild to boost insects and provide food for amphibians. Frogs live in long grass.4. Modern wooden fencing prevents frogs and toads from roaming between gardens. Cut small holes at the fence base, like the increasingly popular “hedgehog holes”.5. Don’t use pesticides or slug pellets or other chemicals that destroy insect life.6. Collar bells for cats can help frogs evade them. Or consider not having a cat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d757402da022a83bcf298b3eb3d761827e76a9/0_436_3780_2269/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613128593f4cfb6abf75a1a2faed77f0","title":"crawley leeds fa cup match report","story":"It has come to feel as if Leeds only deal in FA Cup pain and humiliation. Just five times in 20 years have they made it past the third round and sometimes they have not even got that far. Their supporters still shudder at the crashes from the League One days – against Hereford and non-league Histon in rounds one and two respectively.This was another disaster and the name of League Two Crawley can be added to the roll-call of shame that also includes Newport County, non-league Sutton United and Rochdale. It was an afternoon when Leeds were not so much beaten but torn apart during a second half in which Crawley scored three times and ought to have had more.Were it not for the colours, nobody would have been able to tell the team that sits 12th in the Premier League from the one that occupies sixth place in the bottom ision of the professional game in England. Crawley had the hunger, they had the work rate and the plan, and they had the cutting edge, too.Nick Tsaroulla, a former Tottenham trainee, got the rout started when he sprinted from halfway to finish brilliantly in the 50th minute and it was quickly 2-0 when Ashley Nadesan embarrassed Kiko Casilla at his near post. It was a horror moment for the Leeds goalkeeper but it got even worse for him and his teammates.Crawley’s third came when Casilla pushed out a shot from Nadesan following a corner and the centre-half Jordan Tunnicliffe was on hand to fire into the roof of the net. The minnows had further chances during a period that will live for ever in the memories of their fans who, sadly, had to enjoy it from their living rooms via the BBC.Crawley brought the stardust – not their more illustrious rivals – all the way down to their introduction of the reality TV star Mark Wright as a 90th-minute substitute. Wright, a one-time Spurs youth team player who went on to feature in non-league before seeking his fortune outside the game, is currently the subject of a BBC documentary. The latest episode was exquisitely scripted.Wright, 33, has been training with Crawley for the past couple of months and this was the first game for which he was eligible. The Only Way is Essex? The only way, here, was West Sussex. Never before have Crawley upset Premier League opposition. It was surely the biggest result of their history.“That’s what they’re telling me,” the manager, John Yems, said. “We went to church this morning, and lit a few candles. Nah, not really. We knew we had to make it as difficult as we could – don’t get caught chasing the ball, don’t get mixed up in their game. We did that. We let them have it in front of us and the rest is history.”Marcelo Bielsa had been poetic in his pre-match press conference. “For me, the FA Cup represents English football in its purest form,” the Leeds manager said. He showed his respect to the competition – and Crawley – by naming a strong starting XI, which he set up in a 3-4-3 formation with the England midfielder Kalvin Phillips on the right of the defensive three.Leeds had all the ball in the first half but they failed to do very much with it – an Ian Poveda shot from a tight angle that worked Glenn Morris and an optimistic Rodrigo penalty shout being the sum total of their efforts. And they melted into the background after the interval as Crawley shone the harshest of lights on their defensive looseness. Bielsa has now lost all three of his ties in the competition.Crawley could have been in front at half-time. Nadesan was crowded out after a mistake by Phillips but the big chance came on 41 minutes from a Jack Powell corner only for Tom Nichols to head too close to Casilla, who saved smartly. It did not matter.Bielsa made three changes at half-time, with two of them being the introduction of the youngsters, Oliver Casey and Jack Jenkins. Casey, in particular, struggled in central defence and Leeds were 2-0 down before they had seemingly caught their breath. “They changed up at half-time which I think favoured us,” Nadesan said.The power of Tsaroulla’s 40-yard run was matched by the precision of his low shot into the far corner – where was the Leeds resistance? – and Crawley were in dreamland when Nadesan outpaced Casey and blasted for the near post. The bounce deceived Casilla and the ball squirmed through him.Tom Dallison and Sam Matthews had gone close before Tunnicliffe’s goal while after it, Jake Hessenthaler had two good chances – the first after he dribbled around Casilla Casey would make a saving block. The Rocky theme tune filled the stadium at full-time and the only consolation for Leeds was that Gatwick airport was a mere 10 minutes away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef34f780361ec26d11e156a79515ca9d70c44ccc/0_144_3789_2272/master/3789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d071455490a623a1a3361d9abc49c6e","title":"fran kirby scores four times in emphatic chelsea victory at reading","story":"At the end of an awful, often acrimonious week, blemished by an amalgam of controversy, Covid-19 and multiple postponements, Fran Kirby cut through the gloom engulfing the Women’s Super League. The renascent England forward’s four goals against her former club in the sole top-tier fixture to take place lifted Chelsea to second place as a mix of coronavirus outbreaks and multiple injuries all but ruined the league’s resumption after the winter break.Temporarily at least, Kirby’s excellence against Reading distracted from the finger-pointing fallout from the ill-starred Christmas trips to Dubai taken by leading players from Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United. Infections acquired by internationals from the first two clubs were responsible for two of the weekend’s five postponements and Emma Hayes sounded suitably unimpressed. “I’m disappointed with women’s football this week,” said Chelsea’s manager, who prevented some of her players taking festive breaks abroad. “It’s been a dark week for the women’s game. We must make sure we get back to doing the right things at the right times.“We have a huge responsibility to adhere to not just government guidelines but club guidelines. We have to do better, it hasn’t been good enough. The privilege bestowed on us to be able to go to work when other people are stuck at home is one we are in danger of losing if we don’t behave properly.”Football Association sources have indicated that, as yet, there are no plans to pause a season in which Chelsea have leapfrogged Arsenal and are now three points behind the leaders, Manchester United, with a game in hand. Moreover, although the FA sanctioned four of the postponements, the merits of Birmingham’s unilateral decision not to play at Tottenham due to injuries will be determined by an independent tribunal.Hayes believes the way to avoid suspending the campaign is to mandate clubs to increase their squads by drafting young players into first-team bubbles, thereby ensuring most fixtures can be fulfilled. “Every club has a responsibility to add five or six young players to their squads,” she said. “We have a responsibility to make sure this league finishes,” she said. “We’ve worked so hard to get the women’s game where it is. We must remember that and not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s not have another week like we’ve just had.”Hayes revealed Chelsea suffered their own “bad bout of Covid” over Christmas but they looked the epitome of health from the moment Kirby gave them a 16th-minute lead. The England forward – adjudged just onside – rounded Reading’s goalkeeper, Grace Moloney, after Sam Kerr flicked a defensive clearance forward and sent her accelerating into the area. A classic counterattack was polished off by a fine, low, 12-yard finish.Reading’s narrow midfield diamond and penchant for pressing initially made things congested for Hayes’s creators but Kirby, combining encouragingly well with Kerr, revelled in detecting pockets while stealing between the lines.Perhaps anxious to remind her old club of what they are missing, she swiftly doubled Chelsea’s advantage after intercepting Emma Mitchell’s slapdash pass. Although Mitchell attempted to retrieve the situation, Kirby held off the centre-half adroitly before beating Moloney courtesy of another low shot. It offered further evidence of her personal renaissance since recovering from a virus that attacked her heart.She completed her treble with the first half’s final touch. Erin Cuthbert’s clipped free-kick evaded Reading’s high defensive line before being hooked back into the area by Kerr – who somehow managed to keep the ball in play – prefacing Kirby heading beyond Moloney. A 53rd-minute corner prompted the game’s fourth goal – and her seventh of the WSL campaign. Kirby outleaped Angharad James from Guro Reiten’s delivery and glanced another header home.By the time the substitute Ji So-yun half-volleyed past Moloney, Reading were in tatters. “Fran scored four brilliant goals,” said Hayes. “But it was a total team performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b8191e1e72e5aea395ae942168debfff39cfef/0_110_2780_1668/master/2780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55879eb3fa48d8be0d33e73a086e4a0f","title":"newport brighton fa cup match report","story":"It would be hard to script a better redemption story on a football pitch. After flapping at a stoppage-time cross to gift Newport of League Two an extraordinary equaliser, Brighton’s backup goalkeeper Jason Steele made four fine penalty shootout saves to help the Premier League strugglers advance to the FA Cup fourth round and spare any embarrassment after the ordeal of a nail-biting tie.Adam Webster, whose unfortunate own goal paved the way for extra time, scored the decisive spot-kick as Brighton won 4-3 on penalties following Scot Bennett’s miss.It was to be another agonising climax for Newport, who came unstuck on penalties against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup in September, and a particularly cruel crescendo for their goalkeeper, Tom King, who made three wondrous saves, including a superb stop to deny Lewis Dunk in extra time.In the end King’s opposite number proved the hero but Steele could not bear to look as Webster stepped up to drill in the 14th penalty. “Jason was disappointed with the goal but he responded well,” said the Brighton manager, Graham Potter, who described a hairy escape a traumatic experience. “Credit to Newport and we wish them well in terms of their promotion push. We knew they would be tough opponents.”Newport’s form for an upset has been one of the most charismatic stories in recent years and they almost topped the lot when Kevin Ellison powered at goal with only seconds of extra time to play. A day which began with Ellison, who turns 42 next month, winding up the club physio by calling to say he was overcome with “FA Cup fever” ended with the former Morecambe winger wondering how Dunk managed to block a thunderous half-volley. The game spiralled into extra time after Webster’s own goal, which stemmed from Steele making a mess of a teasing cross, cancelled out Solly March’s 90th-minute strike.Michael Flynn, the mastermind behind Newport sending Leicester, Leeds and Middlesbrough packing in this competition from Rodney Parade, promised Brighton a bobbly pitch and, within three minutes, Dunk was guilty of failing to read the conditions. The Brighton captain undercooked a back pass but Pádraig Amond, who finished as the joint-top scorer alongside Gabriel Jesus in the FA Cup in 2018-19, unusually fluffed his lines.Despite vying for promotion from League Two, the finances of the competition meant Newport were never going to take this lightly. King saved superbly to deny Andi Zeqiri his first Brighton goal but ultimately it was Steele who made the difference. “I’m really thankful for that because I nearly cost us in the last minute,” Steele said. “A lot of credit has to go to my goalkeeping coach who had done a lot of research. In the end I dug myself out of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5170ed1c5ea3282352d1c19cc35fd4d5060874e4/0_156_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4ea4f5124de301843372c493b9734aa8","title":"from yemen to the uk noors story child marriage womens rights podcast","story":"A women’s rights activist tells the extraordinary story of how she fled Yemen after her life was threatened, and her devastation at having to leave her four children behind.

Noor was determined to flee not only because her own life was in danger, but also in the hope of rescuing her four children from the Yemen civil war once she had reached safety, and because her children’s lives would be at risk if she remained in the country. She describes the devastating impact of leaving them behind. Her oldest daughter is at risk of child marriage in Yemen, and she says time is running out to bring her children to safety. Anushka also talks to the ’s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, who examines why Yemen has been described as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman and how unusual and brave it is for a woman from such a country to embark on this kind of journey unaccompanied.

We’ve just had four years of negotiation. We’ve arrived at a treaty and now we’ve got to make that treaty work,” he said.He said there were aspects of the treaty that might be improved on, including how it covered the creative industries and what it did for the service sector, which he said had largely been left out.When it was put to him that this would disappoint Labour members who voted for him because of his commitment to free movement, Starmer said it was not realistic to pretend that the EU would want to negotiate a new Brexit treaty with the UK.“Whether we like it or not, that is going to be the treaty that an incoming Labour government inherits and has to make work. And it is not being straight with the British public to say we can come into office in 2024 and operate some other treaty,” he said.Free movement became an issue in the leadership campaign after the party conference backed the principle in autumn 2019. The commitment was linked to defending migrants’ rights generally, but it contradicted previous party comments saying free movement would end if the UK left the EU.He refused to commit to renewing Labour’s 2019 pledge for free broadband in the next election manifesto, although he said more should be done to improve broadband access for disadvantaged pupils and their families.Starmer also said he did not favour another Scottish independence referendum now, but that he thought Boris Johnson was wrong to rule one out for another 40 years.He also said the status quo with regard to Scotland wasn’t working, which is why he said Labour favoured a constitutional commission."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82eb5bf4b072b888e77624397851bbed1e377601/150_14_1332_799/master/1332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3609ddc549735efe22afba9344ae8cef","title":"labour asks for more help for working parents in england lockdown","story":"Access to furlough should be widened and childcare providers given more support, says shadow chancellorMinisters are being urged to change the eligibility rules for the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme to support working parents and others during the latest national lockdown in England.The call came as fresh analysis showed almost four million people said childcare responsibilities affected their work the last time schools were closed.With schools closed until February half-term at the earliest, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has called on her government counterpart, Rishi Sunak, to take urgent action to help those with caring responsibilities through the current lockdown.Dodds said: “Four million working parents found it hard to juggle work and childcare during the first lockdown.“Almost a year on, the government must change the eligibility rules of the furlough scheme to support working parents and other workers through the current lockdown. Early years providers are also teetering on the brink, with this new lockdown likely to further impact attendance.”Under current rules, iniduals who start a new job after 31 October are no longer eligible for the scheme. ONS data suggests 520,000 people changed jobs between July and September last year.In the same data, 625,000 people changed jobs between April and June. This means some iniduals who started a new job after 31 October could be denied access to furlough during the latest lockdown.Dodds believes that without childcare provisions, there will be significant effect on parents’ ability to continue to work.“It is a short-term financial consideration to not be supporting childcare providers right now,” she said.“That will have an enormous impact on a parent’s ability to work, particularly mothers, and we know that already mothers have been more likely to be made unemployed or to have to changed their hours very radically because of this crisis. This really is a crunch point for a lot of families and a lot of working parents.“We’ve had more guidance about how to play tennis from the government than what working parents should be doing with childcare for their kids and protecting their incomes. That’s really got to change now.”Anne Malindine, the CEO of Raised in Bristol, said: “We’re being asked to be the heroes of the hour but no one was interested in our experiences before. Why are we not, for example, in the priority list for vaccination? Children are living in households of adults and coming into nursery every day.“We can do our best and, undoubtedly, we are, but I think there hasn’t been an opportunity for feedback from a sector that has suddenly has a huge responsibility put on it. And I think that’s really evident for the first time. I haven’t seen it before.”According to Labour analysis, this could result in nearly 19,000 childcare providers being forced to close their doors within six months, and more than 30,000 at risk of closure by next Christmas.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children.“Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children.“We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. Where nurseries do see a drop in income from either parent-paid fees or income from DfE, they are able to use the furlough scheme.“Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.”A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “It’s been clear since the first lockdown that employers can furlough eligible employees who have childcare responsibilities, including because of school closures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c7e90b235f1d43c2e2537ff9075d541311a9193/0_58_5296_3179/master/5296.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=35fcf9dd9cdbc069176c032704895897","title":"uk covid variant unlikely to evade vaccines","story":"Antibodies collected from former patients very rarely target parts of virus mutated in new variant, research finds The new coronavirus variant that is sweeping the UK is extremely unlikely to evade immune responses generated by vaccines or a previous Covid infection, scientists say.The findings will come as a relief to scientists and public health officials who have been concerned that vaccines being rolled out worldwide might be less effective against the new variant, and that cases could soar on the back of reinfections.Iwasaki teamed up with Winston Haynes and others at the California biotech firm Serimmune to investigate how antibodies in the blood of Covid-19 patients target the virus. Antibodies disable viruses by sticking to the proteins from which they are made. Some target continuous strands of protein, like a handful of consecutive words in a sentence, while others latch on to bits of protein that are brought together when they loop and fold.The scientists collected antibodies from 579 coronavirus patients and looked at which continuous strands of virus protein they targeted. The vast majority attacked the same “hotspots” of the virus. Crucially, none of the mutations in the new UK variant are in these hotspots, so most people’s antibody defences will not be weakened.“I believe it is important to give the first shots to as many people as possible, given the emergence of several more contagious variants on the rise,” said Iwasaki. “The second dose should be given, whenever they become available, as close to the recommended original schedule as possible, but a slight delay is not expected to significantly reduce the efficacy. People should wear masks and stay away from crowded indoor gatherings, even after getting the vaccines.”Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study, said it should comfort people who were worried that the new, more transmissible variants found in the UK and South Africa could be resistant to vaccines. He said the work suggested most people’s antibodies would still neutralise both variants.Altmann said: “Many immunologists currently assume that the central, immunological interaction defining the ability to block virus entry is the generation of highly specific, neutralising antibodies that literally prevent virus infection of human cells. These antibodies are targeted to different shapes on the spike. An enormous endeavour over the past year has been to map these structures in great detail so that we may be able to design ever better blocking strategies.“This new study from Winston Haynes and colleagues is a next, hi-tech step in this direction. Their very detailed datasets also offer comfort to those fearful that the new UK and South African variants may be able to evade the neutralising antibodies, diminishing effectiveness of the vaccines. The study reminds us that neutralisation encompasses a large array of different antibody specificities at different sites, most of these unaffected by the mutations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375ea987029a9c6f282bedb454d7a5e3724c05fa/0_163_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ee505f44a1e142446e9315ba0012b67","title":"victorian mayfield bathhouse uncovered archaeologist beneath manchester car park","story":"Mayfield baths found in ‘stunning’ condition by archaeologists on site behind Piccadilly stationA large Victorian washhouse that served Manchester textile workers more than 150 years ago has been uncovered during work to create the city’s first public park in a century.The ornate tiles of the Mayfield baths, whose pools measured nearly 20 metres, were found in “stunning” condition beneath a car park 164 years after it opened.The building, a grand Italianate design set in the heart of Manchester’s booming “Cottonopolis” district, was demolished after being bombed in the second world war but the remains of its swimming pools have been discovered by archaeologists from the University of Salford.The bathhouse, which opened in 1857, was a vital public amenity that served generations of Mancunians, most of whom worked in the surrounding print and textiles factories.The area behind Manchester Piccadilly station has mainly been derelict for years but is undergoing redevelopment as part of plans to build 1,500 homes, retail, leisure and office space, as well as a 6.5-acre park – the first in the city for 100 years.Graham Mottershead, the project manager at Salford Archaeology, said: “The Mayfield bathhouse is a fascinating example of the social and public health advancements that came about during the Industrial Revolution.“As the city’s population boomed with factory workers, crowded and substandard living conditions gave rise to the spread of cholera and typhoid. For those living and working around Mayfield, the Mayfield baths would have been a vital source of cleanliness and hygiene.“The sheer pace of change and innovation during the Industrial Revolution means many advancements were not recorded. Excavations like this help us to learn a great deal about what is arguably the most important period of human history and, in the case of Mayfield, a location that is so very relevant to the heritage of the people of Manchester.”The Mayfield Partnership, the public-private company behind the redevelopment, said it would preserve the ornate tiles from the bathhouse and use them in future. It plans to name one of the new commercial buildings after George Poulton, who became famous in the 1850s as a promoter of public health at the Mayfield baths.The remains, which were uncovered by painstaking hand-digging as well as machine excavation, will be used to form a detailed record of the bathhouse by combining the findings with historical documents and digital drawings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ce2bf917fdb14ef29619005e054cd49db5bdeb8/787_678_5933_3560/master/5933.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6a10119f0cbaaaf29518cbef62441b6d","title":"harlequins london irish premiership match report","story":"No wonder the growing consensus is that the show must go on. A thrilling weekend of Premiership fixtures was rounded off with a final flourish as Oli Hoskins’ last-gasp try – expertly converted by Paddy Jackson – completed a rousing London Irish comeback to earn a draw, testament to their perseverance after a trying few weeks.There appears to be a hole in the calendar next weekend with the European competitions set to be suspended but surely, pandemic permitting, the Premiership clubs will move their fixtures forward – on this evidence the neutral would certainly not be disappointed.Harlequins will be with this result, however. It was a match they let slip away in the closing stages having been 27-15 to the good, and while Irish collect three match points having scored four tries, the hosts go away with just two. They, too, have had their Covid-19 disruptions of late – their last fixture against Worcester was called off while Irish’s last two matches have been cancelled – but while both sides deserve credit for their performances, the mood in the two dressing rooms was evidently different.“I’m pretty disappointed,” said the Harlequins head of rugby, Paul Gustard. “It’s deja vu a little bit, we concede heavy late in games. We have tried different things but we make too many simple errors and are the architects of our own downfall. It’s the same thing happening week on week, the team is hurting and are upset though. We are wearing a bit of pain from time to time, but it is too much pain.”Quins will rue their inability to close the match out given Scott Steele’s second-half try extended their lead to 12 points but their problems began when Archie White was shown a yellow card for a knock-on with 13 minutes to go. Albert Tuisue, one of Irish’s standout performers, powered over to bring the visitors within touching distance before Hoskins finished off from a driving lineout. Jackson’s conversion was difficult, from out on the left, but he nailed it and even had a chance to win it with a penalty – he pushed his kick from halfway to the right.Harlequins began in the ascendancy and threatened down the left with Alex Dombrandt closing in on the try-line, only for the London Irish scrum-half, Ben Meehan, to bundle the No 8 into touch. It is unfortunate for Dombrandt that his failure to convert took place right in front of the watching Eddie Jones, who is yet to be convinced of the player’s suitability to Test rugby.The hosts did make their earlier superiority pay with the opening points – Marcus Smith on target with a penalty from straight in front of the posts – but the Harlequins coaches will have been furious at how London Irish took a surprise lead with the opening try. Curtis Rona has been among the Exiles’ most impressive performers this season but the ease with which he crashed through the Quins defence on a short ball from Meehan will not have been to Gustard’s liking.Smith’s fine try in response no doubt will have been – the fly-half converting for good measure – in what was developing into an entertaining encounter with both sides showing commendable commitment to play. Irish thought they had retaken the lead when Hoskins forced his way over from close range. A knock-on denied the Australian however, and a similar score at the other end from Mike Brown allowed Harlequins to extend their lead to 17-7. Much to their credit given their travails of the last few weeks, Irish would not lie down and a try from the hooker, Motu Matu’u, before half-time kept the deficit to five.Smith and Jackson exchanged penalties in the second half with the impressive Tom Parton going close down the left for Irish but Steele’s score, after Dombrandt’s powerful carry, initially appeared to be enough for Harlequins. They will be kicking themselves that it was not, but take nothing away from Irish’s superb finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162fb3705a0d4b5a1f8fb68fa3798038b6a019f2/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=15c73d6cf93fd58310d21f79e62f87c8","title":"australia v india third test day five live","story":"97th over: India 281-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 8) Target 407 - After surviving that early trial by bouncer Ashwin shows his resolve to defend from the crease, then work a single into the leg-side. Ordinarily it would be two, but Vihari’s hamstring prevents any more than a casual saunter down the pitch. He sees out the over. Following that first ball drama, guess what? ANOTHER INJURY! Cummins sends down another beautiful bouncer, this one cannons into Ashwin’s right shoulder and the phsyio is back out again with the magic spray. India’s No.7 is soon able to continue. This is a thrilling start to the session. Terrifying fast bowling from Cummins. NOT OUT! Drama immediately after Tea. Cummins slips a nasty bumper at Ashwin who fends and loops a catch to the ing Paine who only just got his webbing under the ball. Ashwin reviews and it’s clear the ball looped off the armguard, not the glove, the only question is whether it grazed the glove on the way through. The decision is no, it didn’t. First ball after Tea and Cummins has Ashwin caught behind... or does he?Ok, the players are back out on the field. The next 36 overs, across two-and-a-half hours or so, promises to be gripping. Sad to see of the death of Colin McDonald. He was a little bit before my time as a player, but I remember him as a TV commentator on the ABC back in the dim dark ages. One afternoon as a match drifted to a draw there was complete silence from the TV for a couple of minutes. In the background you could hear a frantic producer saying \u0027commentate on what\u0027s happening\u0027. McDonald replied, I AM commentating on what\u0027s happening.“Me and the SCG go back a LONG way,” begins Peter. “I used to go sit on the Hill back in the good old days of the 60s when God was in His Heaven, Dougie was thrashing any and all, eskis were chocka, and the Hill was the Hill. Much of the fun was banter with whatever fielder was in ear shot (later on I moved to Melbourne and Bay 13 of the MCG. Same thing). But even then: there was an etiquette. We might have said many things to the opposing side fielders —and to our side too. Among them, the immortal comment to the notoriously slow-scoring Jim Burke, a stalwart for NSW: “Burkey, I wish I were a pigeon and you were a statue”. We might have called the Poms “bloody Poms”. But racist abuse? I believe and hope, never. If anyone had ever ventured such a thing, we would have shut him up. I am saddened to hear not just that a gang of drunk idiots said such a thing. But even more, that decent cricket Ozzies sitting around did not shut them up.”96th over: India 280-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 7) Target 407 - Ashwin safely deals with four Lyon deliveries so that prompts the bowler to come around the wicket and Paine to bring in four chattering catchers around the bat. The result is a streaky edge away for a single. Vihari keeps out the final delivery and “Tea” is called. The end of an engrossing session in what has been a fascinating day. 36 overs remain, all four results are still in play.95th over: India 279-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 6) Target 407 - The pattern continues of India dead-batting Australia away. Vihari sees off Starc again with no alarm. The hamstrung No.6 is now four from 51 deliveries.94th over: India 279-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 6) Target 407 - Ashwin plays Lyon watchfully, plonking his front foot down the pitch and bringing his bat down alongside it, with no gap for the bowler to penetrate. One thick edge was a regulation single, but Vihari is far from regulation fitness. 93rd over: India 279-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 6) Target 407 - Mitchell Starc returns for a burst, bowling his left-arm rockets from around the wicket to the right-handed Vihari. The batsman makes little attempt to move his feet or show any initiative, dead batting anything on his stumps and aiming tentative prods outside off, one of which just missed the outside edge after keeping low.  92nd over: India 279-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 6) Target 407 - Beautiful over from Lyon, testing Ashwin on the inside and outside. The Indian spinner defends from the crease and survives a DRS review then opens his shoulders and clouts a length ball over cow corner for four. Maybe India are operating Plan A and a half, and not fully Plan B after all. The ball did not strike Ashwin’s bat or gloves on the way in or the way out of his forward defence before popping up to silly point. Australia down to just one review.Lyon thinks he has Ashwin caught at bat pad. Umpire Reiffel disagrees. 91st over: India 275-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 2) Target 407 - Vihari dots out a Hazlewood maiden. India do appear to have begun Plan B. They have 41 overs to survive. David Markham emails in: “While everybody talks about whether a shot is played or not for LBW, can I point out that that is not what Law 38 says. It talks about ‘a genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat’. If you plant your front forward with your bat tucked in behind the pad, you are not making a genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat.” The definition of genuine - determined by the umpires - seems not to be agreed upon by Nathan Lyon and Cheteshwar Pujara. Not that it matters much for this match any more. 90th over: India 275-5 (Vihari 4, Ashwin 2) Target 407 - Lyon ripping through his work, trying to hurry India. Ashwin picks up an easy single then Vihari is beaten by a wider ball that barely bounces. A further easy single ends the over.Wisden India has more on the Steve Smith pitch scratching situation. 89th over: India 273-5 (Vihari 3, Ashwin 1) Target 407 - Ashwin comes to the crease ahead of Jadeja and he defends three deliveries then calls Vihari through for a quick single, seemingly oblivious to his partner’s injury. Vihari barely breaks into a jog and would have been run out with a direct hit from mid-on. Surely India’s approach now adapts to digging in for a draw?Bosh! Josh Hazlewood lands the new ball on a perfect length, it holds its line, ghosts its way past Pujara’s defensive blade and clatters into off stump. In a match of massive moments, that may prove the massivest. Brilliant bowling to end an magnificent innings lasting 205 deliveries.88th over: India 272-4 (Pujara 77, Vihari 3) Target 407 - An eventful over begins with Nathan Lyon bellowing for an LBW against Pujara despite the ball striking the pad outside off stump and a shot clearly played. It’s obvious Australia’s interpretation of a shot is different to that of Paul Reiffel and Che Pujara this series. Then all the action revolves around Vihari’s hammy. Still nowhere near the best hamstring injury on Australian TV.Vihari defends one ball from Lyon, then confers with Pujara, looking very likely he’s about to retire. But he’s convinced to stay on. The physio applies a compression bandage to Vihari’s right hamstring. In the commentary box, the best of the bunch by the length of the Flemington straight - Ricky Ponting - suggests if Vihari’s running is compromised he should retire hurt. His inability to run will halt India’s run-chase. However, he could return later to plug up an end if his side ends up blocking out for a draw. While there’s a break in play, can anyone add anything to this enquiry?A slight delay for - you’ll never believe it - another Indian injury. Vihari and Pujara scampered through for a quick single and it ended with the former pulling up very gingerly and clutching at his right buttock. On comes the physio...87th over: India 271-4 (Pujara 76, Vihari 3) Target 407 - Hazlewood replaces Cummins and his first delivery is on the money - and edged into the ground and through the gully region for four! Australia’s pacemen continue to attack the stumps, looking to exploit the variable bounce rather than work with swing and seam to tickle the outside edge. Hmmm. Pucovski has now left the field for treatment. 86th over: India 266-4 (Pujara 71, Vihari 3) Target 407 - Marnus Labsuchagne saved four from silly point, puffing his cheeks out instead of demonstrating pain, then later in the over Pucovski ed awkwardly on his right shoulder, drawing concerned looks from teammates already aware of his preexisting condition. The young Victorian continues. Vihari inches India two runs closer to history. 85th over: India 264-4 (Pujara 71, Vihari 1) Target 407 - Vihari gets off the mark with a stab behind square on the leg-side in a Cummins over where the plan of attack is very straight. There are only two slips in place, despite the brand new ball. A reflection of the fine balance Paine now faces between attack and defence, and also the nature of the surface and the presumed preferred method for taking wickets.Meanwhile, Jadeja has emerged padded up on the balcony!Thank you very much G-banger, what a pleasure it is to step into the hotseat at such an extraordinary moment. Rishabh Pant has already treated us to one of the great fourth-innings performances, a knock that has turned a humdrum Monday from a procession to something containing that wondrous crackle of possibility that only the fifth day of a Test match can deliver. Three hours remain. All four results are very much alive. Let’s get it on. Send your emails to jonathan.howcroft.casual@the and tweets @JPHowcroft. 84th over: India 262-4 (Pujara 70, Vihari 0) The new batsman will have to find a way into the game. Vihari sees out a maiden from Hazlewood, and that will be drinks.What a day. I’ll be watching rest avidly to see what more is to come. There’s nothing like that low, building, burbling excitement of a fifth-day classic. That’s it for me on the OBO today. For the final stages, the throne room scene, I shall leave you with the lithe and fearsome Jonathan Puma Howcroft.83rd over: India 262-4 (Pujara 70, Vihari 0) Pujara keeps going, driving the first ball of Cummins’ new over for four. Too full, a simple push through the line. Next ball, much more flourish, back cuts for four! Got width, got all of it, wafting the wrists to get the bat moving in a circular motion and make the ball vanish to backward point.Cummins corrects, and that’s three in a row! Cheteshwar Pujara, you rogue. A straighter line and so he drives through mid-on this time, sweetly timed. No one anywhere near it. This makes things interesting for Australia. Three boundaries in a row off Cummins with the shiny new Kooka. India need 145 to win. If this pair can get that to double figures things will get extremely interesting. 82nd over: India 250-4 (Pujara 58, Vihari 0) A good sign from Vihari, as he comes onto the front foot to drive Hazlewood crisply, though it gets stopped at cover. A maiden in the end. Aditya Anchuri was prescient not long before the Pant wicket. “Hoping I’m proved wrong, but India still has an extremely small chance of avoiding defeat. Essentially we need to have a perfect session, where we go into tea 3 (at most 4) wickets down. And even then, in the final session against this Aussie attack one more wicket will draw a collapse (especially with Jadeja unfit to bat).”81st over: India 250-4 (Pujara 58, Vihari 0) The new ball, Cummins, all that jazz. How will India go about it? At Headingley, Bairstow came in after a wicket around the time of the second new ball, and attacked it to take 66 from it with Ben Stokes from about 10 overs. The bowlers will be tiring. But this batting pair are the men least likely to take to the bowling. Cummins gets some good deck off the seam, cutting into Pujara an absolute mile. Keeps it out of his stomach off the gloves. Then movement away from Pujara, who resists playing at it. So what’s the scenario? 157 runs needed from 51 overs. No wickets to play with. But, that’s only three an over. If this pair can keep working the runs down, that will make life harder for Australia. That seems the better approach than just defending. 80th over: India 250-4 (Pujara 58, Vihari 0) Lyon gets five balls at Hanuma Vihari, another right-hander, who blocks them out. Labuschagne is getting sledged by his own teammates after he starts chattering again. “Don’t just chat when we get a wicket, Marnus, got to keep it going all day,” says Warner. And now it’s time for the new ball.Well, I’m sorry to Robert Smithson, who wrote a few minutes ago wishing luck to Pant. “I’m in London, and about to go to bed. All a test cricket fan ever really wants is for a match to go down to the last session on the last day, and it seems that somehow that’s what we might just get. I haven’t even been watching this test, just reading it, and it’s glorious stuff. So thank you Rishabh Pant for being a lunatic and thank you Geoff \u0026amp pals for telling us about it.”Aaaaaaahhhh he falls! Short of the ton, and well short of the win, but Rishabh Pant has changed the game. The way he played was always going to bring that risk. He advances at Lyon, looks to drive through cover again, but Lyon gets enough purchase and turn. Takes the thick outside edge to backward point where Cummins es forward and claims a good low catch. Celebrations for Australia, while Pant walks off trailing his bat on the ground like Paul Bunyan dragging his axes. What an entertainer, what a fight.79th over: India 250-3 (Pujara 58, Pant 97) Green coming in over the wicket, bowls short and Pujara pulls for four! The first pull shot I can recall him playing in this innings. That was played with authority, middled along the ground through square leg, precise as you like. The set-square and compass man, Pujara. (No, not saying that he’s a Freemason.)78th over: India 246-3 (Pujara 54, Pant 97) Pujara still using the dancefloor approach to Lyon, flicking square and taking a single as Cummins es across from midwicket. Pant drives a run down the ground. Pujara goes to square leg again. They’re milking the spin effectively now. Pant takes on Lyon once more, charging and flogging it flat to long on. Shouts of catch but the man is too square and Hazlewood can’t get there. And when Pant attacks Lyon, he attacks in twos. Down the track, bat-pad flinches, cover sprawls, but Pant has opened the face and slayed it through cover for four more! He’s on 97, and India need 161 to win!“I think Cummins is possibly the only Australian bowler immune to thoughts of Stokes with the lead under 200. 12 overs on the trot from that man, thanks,” writes Eamonn Maloney. I suspect you’ll see that in two overs once the new ball arrives.77th over: India 235-3 (Pujara 52, Pant 88) Green bowling, and Pant won’t put his shots away as the day goes on. Gets width, throws the full IKEA display kitchen at it, and slices it over the slips for four! There’s a deep backward point almost, for Pant, rather than a traditional third man, but he can’t get around. Next ball? Same again! Width, swing, and this one more outside edge than slice, and it goes a little finer. Next ball? Wide, swings, drives it hard to cover for no run. 55 overs left, 172 to win.Headingley klaxon! “Paine, Labuschagne, Wade, Warner, Lyon, Cummins and Hazlewood must be getting a few harrowing flashbacks to Leeds a year last September...” writes Ian Forth.76th over: India 227-3 (Pujara 52, Pant 80) The half-century for Pujara with a beauty, dancing down at Lyon, whipping hard with a lot of wrist, on the bounce and nutmegs Wade at short leg before smoothly rolling for a boundary at deep square leg. He’s found a method against Lyon and it’s worked so far. 180 to win.75th over: India 223-3 (Pujara 48, Pant 80) Green bowling instead of Starc now. I reckon this plays in India’s favour, letting them get their eyes in ahead of facing the second new ball. Pant drives Green out through cover for three, and that gives David Warner’s groin a workout (if you’ll forgive the image) as he chases it to the rope and keeps it in. Pujara just ducks and weaves against the rest, including one bouncer so high and tailing so far that it’s called a wide. When Green pitches up, Pujara on-drives a single. The runs keep coming, 184 to win in 57 overs. 74th over: India 218-3 (Pujara 47, Pant 77) Lyon to Pant, who cuts hard and gets a thick bottom edge into Paine’s shin pad behind the stumps and then to slip. Hope no one tries to claim that one as a drop, that was rocketing. As a contrast, Pant sedately turns away a single to allow Pujara to block out the rest. Pujara has 6000 runs in Test cricket after that last over. He’s faced over 13,000 balls to get them. 73rd over: India 217-3 (Pujara 47, Pant 76) Short from Starc and an uppercut from Pujara for four! Quite the shot. Just instinct I think, Starc angles the ball in at Pujara from around the wicket, and while first thinking of protecting himself Pujara just opens the face of the bat late and deflects it high over the cordon to the boundary. Then shapes to pull but bails out, before nudging away a less short ball for a run. Pant pulls a single to follow. 190 to win. 72nd over: India 211-3 (Pujara 42, Pant 75) Lyon to start proceedings to Rishabh Pant, with that bat-pad in place on the off side. Pant skips immediately and drives a run to long-on. Some ODI batting. Pujara comes down as well and flicks away, and it’s a chance but a near impossible one. Wade at short leg sidesteps with Pujara as he advances, and the shot is middle straight into Wade’s hand and then away to midwicket. He was hit by the ball, there was no chance of seeing it, but it could have looped up somewhere. To follow up, Pujara scores a run to point.The target is under 200 now. 199 to win.71st over: India 209-3 (Pujara 41, Pant 74) Starc will resume after lunch, this is interesting. Hazlewood and Cummins are the danger pair after a pause, but are they being saved for the new ball? It’s 10 overs away. Starc bumps Pant, and clips him on the side of the helmet. Not a blow that does damage, it’s angled across him and flies away to third man for two leg byes. Another short ball and Pant pulls a run to fine leg. With the right-hander on strike though, Starc is bowling like a busted. Wide or down the leg side, easy to leave. What a session of Test cricket: that’s as good as just about anything else I’ve seen. Hazlewood, Cummins, Lyon all bowling really well. The anticipation overnight, the dismissal of India’s captain early. But then the masterstroke of sending the team’s most attacking player out there, something that may not have worked nine times out of ten, but this is the ten. Rishabh Pant took them on like you rarely see in Test cricket, hitting three sixes and eight fours, and severely disrupting Australia’s premier spinner.Australia’s problems have been Starc bowling poorly and Paine’s two dropped catches behind the wicket. He’ll get plenty of scrutiny for those, although I’d class them as the type that a keeper doesn’t have control over: they either hit the gloves or they don’t.The numbers still say it’s Australia’s Test: the likelihood is that the one erratic ball will come along, the partnership will end, and the probable result will arrive. But for now, the chance of something far more remarkable happening survives. Enjoy that feeling while you contemplate your sandwiches.70th over: India 206-3 (Pujara 41, Pant 73) Last over before lunch, Lyon to Pujara, a slip and twin bat-pads either side of him, but Pujara isn’t shutting up shop when he sees the slightest touch of shortness, stepping back and cracking it through cover point for four!Neil Titterington emails. “I cannot be the only Aussie sat here not-so-secretly willing India on here, can I?! After the troubling events yesterday, I would genuinely love for them to be able to give the ultimate two fingers to those so-called Australian fans.”69th over: India 202-3 (Pujara 37, Pant 73) Cummins to Pant, around the wicket, but Pant is playing circumspectly for the time being, blocking and leaving. Cummins tries an off-break slower ball but it’s outside the stumps and left alone. Pant ducks a bouncer rather than hooking it. Two minutes until lunch is probably why. Maiden over.68th over: India 202-3 (Pujara 37, Pant 73) Lyon gets his shot at Pant, has men in the deep, so Pant happily pushes a single through cover point. That makes 100 runs in the session for India. Pujara advances and defends, knocking the ball away with the knee-roll of his pad that raises shouts of “Catch!” No bat there. Plenty on the next ball though, as Pujara skips down and whips through midwicket for four. Lovely shot, up on one foot as he struck it, balletic and elegant. What a player he is. It raises the team 200 and the 100 partnership, batting on day five to stay in a Test match. 67th over: India 197-3 (Pujara 33, Pant 72) Pujara has kept the strike to face Cummins, who bowls over the wicket to the right-hander, back of a length, in at the gloves. One bouncer in the over. Pujara doesn’t mind any of it. He is the headland, bowlers are the sea.66th over: India 197-3 (Pujara 33, Pant 72) Ha. A cheer of celebration from Paine as he sees Pujara edge the ball, then turns back to see it in Steve Smith’s hands at slip. Only problem was that it bounced first. Lyon bowling around the wicket to Pujara and he still looks dangerous, four balls that have the batsman discomfited, having to defuse them more than play them. Sixth ball Pujara advances and whips a run square. 65th over: India 196-3 (Pujara 32, Pant 72) Back to the big guns. Paine turns to Cummins. Has him come around the wicket at Pant, the same approach that Cummins took when he smashed the batsman on the arm in the first innings. Cummins bluffs though, doesn’t bowl short but bowls a length for the first few balls. Fifth ball is too full, and Pant cover-drives him for four! Tom Bowtell writes in. “I’m getting distinct Pant-focused flashbacks to this final day. Am hereby predicting an identical final result here, with Lyon’s 400th wicket taking the place of Anderson’s 564th as the denouement.”64th over: India 192-3 (Pujara 32, Pant 68) Lyon to Pujara, who is looking to score once or twice but can’t beat the field with his nudges. Fifth ball there’s a proper appeal, Lyon gives it the genuflecting spirit fingers and all the sauce. Umpire Reiffel says nahhhh. Smashed Pujara on the pad but it was high and spinning down leg side. Massive turn for Lyon though. Maiden over.63rd over: India 192-3 (Pujara 32, Pant 68) Another boundary for Pant! He loves to start an over this way. Starc makes it easy by bowling very full outside his off stump, allowing Pant to drive hard through it to the cover boundary. It’s a no-ball too! Then he takes a single from the next. You would think the Australians want Pant on strike because he’s the one they’d have more chance to get out, but effectively he’s managed to get off strike first ball of the over and cost them five runs in the process. Pujara though gets moving a little, gliding a couple of runs behind point, then glancing a straight one for a single. Pant back on strike. Smacks a wider ball to point but Pucovski puts in another good ing stop to make it a dot ball. Not the final ball though, too short and Pant pulls it for four! No protection out at midwicket. This is a remarkable innings. The over costs 13 and India need 215.62nd over: India 179-3 (Pujara 29, Pant 59) Pant pushes an early run to point from Lyon. Australia having to go some Plans B \u0026amp C now. Two short legs in for Pujara against Lyon, who changes to over the wicket for one ball, then changes back and goes around. Wants to draw that edge into pad. But Pujara does not misread the line of the ball once in this over. What a player Pujara is. He’s faced 117 balls now. They’re down to 70 overs left, and 222 runs behind, the Richie Benaud.61st over: India 178-3 (Pujara 29, Pant 58) Starc to Pant, short, fended away without alarm for a single to the leg side. Starc comes around the wicket to Pujara, left-hander to right-armer, an approach that Starc enjoys when he gets the ball to reverse. We’ve seen him absolutely demolish a couple of line-ups doing this, in Galle against Sri Lanka and in Durban against South Africa and in Melbourne against Pakistan, most notably. Can reverse it away from the edge to get nicks, or inwards to hit stumps. It’s not really swerving for him today though. Pujara picks up a couple of runs clipped behind square leg, his spot, no matter how well it’s guarded.60th over: India 175-3 (Pujara 27, Pant 57) Lyon is going to come back and try again. Bowling to Pant. And he’s dropped first ball! For once Pant doesn’t attack, he defends from the crease and Lyon rags it from the rough, takes a fine edge up high on the outside edge, and I think that went low straight into Paine’s leg rather than glove. Lyon has had Pant nicking twice today. After a few balls Pant whacks one through point for a run, then Pujara draws the most unrealistic appeal of the day after a ball comes off the flap of his front pad, outside leg stump, about a foot from his bat, but Lyon and Wade want to ask if there was a catch.

When travel restrictions stopped him from skipping back and forth across the Tasman Sea, he decided to explore the waters closer to home – by buying a boat of his own.In November, Goodchild bought a 60ft-long wooden schooner. A keen sailor, he had had his eye on the local yacht market at the start of 2020, but the emergence of coronavirus focused his mind. “I thought, ‘I’m stuck over here – this is a way I can spend my time.”“To me, a boat was a good lifestyle change to have over the next few years as the dust settles with Covid,” he said.Goodchild was not alone. A global boating boom has been reported in response to the pandemic. Travel restrictions and months in lockdown have prompted people to pursue bucket-list life goals or take up new outdoor pastimes – sending boat sales soaring.The New Zealand Marine Industry Association has said boat sales since June have doubled compared with those in the same period in 2019 – more than compensating for a sharp pandemic-driven drop from April to June. Enrolment in marine courses has also seen an uptick.New Zealand has a consistently high rate of boat ownership per capita due to its extensive coastline, protected sounds and island-dotted harbours.Blair Harkness, director of City of Sails Marine in Auckland, said recent months had been the busiest he had seen in some 15 years of operating. After a quiet start to 2020, the rise in interest since about October – coinciding with the start of the summer cruising season – had been “quite extraordinary”, he said.Trailer boats, powerboats and catamarans were selling especially well, according to Harkness, but even yachts – often more skill- and labour-intensive – had seen increased interest.He attributed it to New Zealanders, prevented by border restrictions from holidaying overseas, wanting to explore a new side of their country. “They’ve got money to spend, and they’ve recognised that going boating is a really good way to go … And of course the sea is a great playground.”On New Zealanders’ immediate emergence from lockdown in mid-May, boats had the added appeal of being distanced, adds Harkness: “You’ve got your own bubble on the boat.”Boat brokers worldwide have reported a sudden reversal of slow sales at the start of 2020. In the US the National Marine Manufacturers Association said that May 2020 saw the highest new boat sales in a decade.Steve Thomas, co-owner of Nelson-based New Zealand Boat Sales, said weeks in lockdown had focused people’s minds on how they wanted to spend their time. New-build boats in particular were doing a brisk trade, even at the top end of the market. Thomas said 40 orders had been placed in a week for a new Seawind Catamaran, listed for $1.5m. Demand was such that wait times were being driven out to years – further fuelling the fear of missing out, Thomas said.The global shift to remote working had also encouraged people to attempt a “totally different lifestyle”. “They want to try new things … You can buy a new 46ft catamaran for what you can buy a house for and you’re accessible with the internet wherever you go,” Thomas said.Gary Whatmough bought a 37ft catamaran in October, with a view to working towards a long-held dream of sailing the South Pacific, once Covid-related restrictions lift – and if his partner can be persuaded to give up her job. “I want to go live on the boat, and she doesn’t so much. It’s just getting around that.”They had started off with the North Island, sailing four nights from Nelson to their home in Whangārei then two weeks cruising the Bay of Islands over Christmas. “The plan is just to use it as much as we can,” says Whatmough.Like property, boat sales have been buoyed by low interest rates, suggesting to Thomas that this flurry cannot go on forever. “How long it will last is the million-dollar question. It has to slow down this year, and a lot of that will be driven by the fact that there aren’t going to be boats to buy.”Whatmough is more sceptical. “It makes me laugh, how everyone says there’s no boats for sale. I can tell you that nearly every boatie has their price.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda2fe69b48bd3e070c413622d909201f5a9b287/0_379_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56fc13f1526c2806141b00260c85c87d","title":"coronavirus live news new york opens mass vaccination sites as global cases pass 90m","story":"South Korea daily virus cases under 500 for first time since record highs in December one in five people in England may have had coronavirus New Covid variant from Brazil detected in JapanOne year ago, China announced the first death from a new virus in Wuhan - 12 months later, Covid-19 has claimed 1.9 million lives in an unrelenting march across the world.AFP: But in the central Chinese city of 11 million where the first known outbreak started, the virus has been extinguished.On Monday morning, the anniversary slipped by unmarked in Wuhan - commuters moved freely to work while parks and riverside promenades buzzed with walkers in a city determined to banish its tag as the coronavirus ground zero.In a sparse report on January 11, 2020, China confirmed its first death from an unknown virus - a 61-year-old man who was a regular at the now-notorious Wuhan wet market linked to many of the early cases.The world would soon become grimly familiar with the disease that killed him as Covid-19.Little is still known about the first victim, including his name, while the market where the first reported clusters of cases were traced back to has remained closed, surrounded by boarding.Independent experts are yet to be granted access to the market or retrace in detail those early days of the virus in Wuhan.11 January marks a year since the first known coronavirus death was confirmed in Wuhan, China: Mainland China saw its biggest daily increase in Covid-19 cases in more than five months, the country’s national health authority said on Monday, as new infections in Hebei province surrounding Beijing continued to rise, Reuters reports. A county in the northeastern Heilongjiang province on Monday moved into lockdown after reporting new novel coronavirus infections, state television also reported separately.Hebei accounted for 82 of the 85 new local infections reported on Jan. 10, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement, with Liaoning Province also reporting two new cases and Beijing reporting one new case. The country also saw 18 new imported infections from overseas.The total number of new Covid-19 cases stood at 103, the highest since 127 cases were reported on July 30.Though the new cases being reported in recent days remain a small fraction of what the country saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020, authorities are moving aggressively to curb the spread of the disease and prevent another national wave of infections.The NHC reported 76 new asymptomatic patients for all of mainland China, up from 27 a day earlier. China does not count these iniduals, who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but not exhibiting symptoms, as confirmed COVID-19 cases.Total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 87,536, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. More now on the opposition to the Tokyo Olympics: The Kyodo poll results show a hardening of opposition to the Olympics among the Japanese public, despite repeated claims by the organisers, the IOC and government officials that it will be possible to host a “Covid- safe” Games under plans to be released in the spring.But with the vaccine rollout in Japan expected to start several months later than those in the US, Britain and other European countries, doubts are growing about the wisdom of allowing 11,000 athletes, as well as large numbers of officials and other Games-related staff to enter Japan. No decision has been made on whether to admit overseas sports fans.Concern that the Games may have to be called off has spread to the organising committee itself, according to the Asahi Shimbun.“The Tokyo Olympics could be canceled if the state of emergency is not lifted by March,” a Tokyo 2020 official told the newspaper. Another Olympic-related official cited the difficulty in winning over the public when medical workers are struggling to cope with an influx of Covid patients in the capital.The IOC’s official line is that the Games will go ahead as planned, but last week, the organisation’s longest-serving member, Dick Pound, said he was uncertain about Tokyo 2020’s prospects. “I can’t be certain because the ongoing elephant in the room would be the surges in the virus,” Pound told the BBC.The new strain of the coronavirus first detected in Britain has been confirmed in Mexico for the first time, health officials in northern Tamaulipas state said in a statement on Sunday, adding a new layer of concern to an already severe national outbreak.A 56-year-old man who flew on 29 December from Mexico City to the city of Matamoros, just south of the U.S.-Mexico border, tested positive for the new strain, according to Tamaulipas Health Minister Gloria Molina.The man was described as an “international traveler,” and his name and nationality were not disclosed.The fast-spreading new strain of the virus has also been found in South Africa and Australia, prompting authorities to take more aggressive action to prevent even greater contagion as countries across the globe struggle to contain the pandemic.England’s chief medical officer has warned the NHS faces the “most dangerous situation” in living memory as the pandemic causes record deaths and hospital admissions, PA Media reports. As the country awaits the ramping up of coronavirus testing and vaccinations this week, Chris Whitty has said the only way to prevent avoidable deaths is for the public to stay home wherever possible.“Hospitals are always busy in winter, but the NHS in some parts of the country is currently facing the most dangerous situation anyone can remember,” Prof Whitty wrote in the Sunday Times.“If the virus continues on this trajectory, hospitals will be in real difficulties, and soon.“Staff-to-patient ratios - already stretched - will become unacceptable even in intensive care.”The number of patients with Covid-19 in hospital is at a record high in England, while the official coronavirus death toll for the UK passed 80,000 on Saturday and lab-confirmed cases hit more than three million.Ministers were under pressure on Sunday night to escalate the current lockdown in England amid warnings that current measures may not be tough enough.They came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said about 2 million people – including about a third of people over the age of 80 – had already been vaccinated, and the opening of the mass vaccination sites is intended to accelerate the process.More than half a million people over the age of 80 are to receive letters inviting them to attend one of seven large coronavirus vaccination centres opening in England, where they will be able to book an appointment online or over the phone.But, in an interview on Sunday, Hancock also said that, with hospital cases and deaths still rising sharply, the NHS was “probably under the greatest pressure it ever has been”:  Nearly half of England’s headteachers are being forced to prioritise class places among vulnerable students and the children of key workers because of a huge increase in demand, according to a survey of school leaders.The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which carried out the survey, said the government’s “confused” messages to parents on school attendance risks defeating its aim of suppressing the virus: Small businesses and manufacturers in the UK are bracing themselves for a fight for survival this year, according to fresh survey data, as they negotiate the twin threats of Covid-19 and weaker post-Brexit trade with the EU.More than 250,000 small firms expect to fold without further government financial support, according to a quarterly poll by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).Manufacturers’ trade body Make UK said its members expected lower investment in the UK and to have a harder time recruiting talent: South Korea reported fewer than 500 new coronavirus infections on Monday for the first time since record high daily case numbers over the Christmas holiday period, Reuters reports. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 451 new cases as of midnight on Sunday, driven by a lull in testing as well as an apparent easing in infections.The country reported a record 1,241 cases in one day during the Christmas holiday, the peak of the country’s largest wave of infections yet.South Korea stopped short of a complete lockdown or stay-at-home order, but has imposed unprecedented restrictions for weeks, including banning private gatherings of more than four people.In the capital Seoul and surrounding areas a number of high-risk businesses such as bars and gyms were ordered to close and coffee shops can only offer takeaway service.The country employs aggressive tracing and testing which has allowed it to blunt successive waves of infections, though the latest surge threatens to overwhelm that system.Overall South Korea has reported a total of 69,114 cases, with 1,140 deaths.The spokesman for Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, the same day the country detected a case of a Covid-19 variant that is spreading in the United Kingdom, AP reports. Spokesman Jesús Ramírez Cuevas wrote on his Twitter account, “I am in good health and I will be working from home.” There was no word on whether the president had been tested: Ramírez Cuevas is close to López Obrador, often handing him documents or going on trips with the president.López Obrador is 67 and has high blood pressure, but almost never wears a mask.On Sunday, López Obrador toured the Pacific coast seaport of Manzanillo and gave a speech, as usual without a mask on.Also on Sunday, health authorities in the northern border state of Tamaulipas detected a case of the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7. That strain has also been found in the United States, Canada, Italy, India and the United Arab Emirates.Scientists in the U.K. have said the variant may be more contagious than previously identified strains.The Tamaulipas state health department said the case was detected in a 56-year-old man who arrived on 29 December at an airport in the border city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, aboard a flight from Mexico City. No one else on the flight tested positive.Coronavirus infections have now surpassed 90 million confirmed cases around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University, as more countries brace for wider spread of more virulent strains of a disease that has now killed nearly 2 million worldwide.The number of infections worldwide has doubled in just 10 weeks, according to a tally by John Hopkins University on Sunday. Covid-19 infections had hit 45 million as recently as late October.As of Sunday afternoon, John Hopkins counted 90,005,787 infections around the world.The United States, now with more than 22.2 million infections, led the world with the highest number of infections recorded since the global pandemic began. The number of US cases is more than double that of India, which has recorded nearly 10.5 million infections.Brooklyn Army Terminal is one of two mass vaccination locations that opened in New York City on Sunday. The second one is located at Bathgate Contract Postal Station in the borough of the Bronx.Reuters: The mass sites were open for part of the day on Sunday before they start operating round the clock, seven days a week on Monday as part of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s push to set up 250 vaccination locations to meet the ambitious goal of inoculating 1 million New Yorkers by the end of the month.Three other smaller sites also opened on Sunday in Brooklyn, the Bronx and in Queens.In New York, like in much of the United States, efforts to get the two vaccines that have so far been authorised into the arms of Americans have moved slower than hoped due to a slew of issues. They included strict rules controlling who should get inoculated first, with some healthcare workers at the front of the line declining the shots, and a lack of planning or direction on the federal level.As of early Sunday, New York City had administered 203,181 doses of the vaccines to its residents out of more than 524,000 doses that have been delivered, data from the city’s health department showed.On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who previously said all healthcare workers should be inoculated before the state moved on to other categories, changed course, saying people aged 75 and over could receive the shot starting on Monday.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said healthcare workers and nursing home residents and staff should have priority for the limited supply of vaccines. The agency softened that guidance on Friday, recommending that states move to those next on the list - people over age 75 and so called “essential” workers - to accelerate lagging vaccination programs.Hello and welcome to our live coronavirus coverage with me, Helen Sullivan.

In some areas, however, the disparity may be even greater. Parts of London and the south are estimated to have had up to eight times as many cases as have been detected to date.The government’s test-and-trace programme had detected 2.4 million cases by the same date.The model estimates the number of cases in an areas by comparing its number of deaths against an estimated infection fatality rate. It assumes a three-week lag between recorded cases and any associated deaths.The model suggests that two in five people have been infected in six London and south-eastern local authorities: Barking and Dagenham, Newham, Thurrock, Redbridge, Havering and Tower Hamlets.Official figures from Public Health England show that just under 14,700 cases recorded in Barking and Dagenham and just under 21,700 in Newham by 3 January.The estimates are in keeping with the accepted knowledge that the actual number of infections is likely to be far higher than the number of recorded cases because of asymptomatic cases and the failure of testing to pick up every case. This is especially true at the start of the pandemic when the UK’s testing regime was far poorer.Official government data on recorded cases to date shows Merthyr Tydfil, Blackburn with Darwen and Blaenau Gwent as having the highest rates of recorded cases, but the new estimates suggest the published case figures are far lower than the “real” level of infection.Daily testing capacity stood at below 40,000 for the first half of April, while it is now over 500,000.The modelling suggests that Newham, Reading and Barking and Dagenham each have seen almost eight times as many infections as official recorded figures show.Estimated cases are more than five times the official count in 77 areas of England – just over half the 149 upper-tier local authorities analysed.George Batchelor, the co-founder and director of Edge Health, said: “Reported tests are only a fraction of the picture of total infections, which show how badly hit London and the north-west have been during the pandemic. It is incredible that the level of understanding of where and how infections are occurring is not greater at this stage, since it would allow control measures to be more targeted. “Even with imminent vaccinations, it is crucial to develop this understanding so that future variants of the virus can be effectively controlled and managed.”Edge Health estimated total cases by looking at each local authority’s Covid-related deaths as published by the Office for National Statistics and their estimated infection fatality ratio (IFR).The IFR is calculated by looking at a local authority’s age profile and applying age-specific infection fatality ratios from University of Cambridge research. These infection fatality rates are slightly lower for the second wave.Once these two metrics are known, the researchers can estimate the number of cases on any one day by scaling the number of deaths in 18 days’ time - used here as a standardised time period between recorded infection and death - by an area’s estimated infection fatality ratio. The modelled number of cases is then extrapolated forward to the present by assessing how test positivity rates have changed over the last three months.The modelling takes into account an area’s cases, deaths and age structure, but it does not look at other factors such as deprivation.Karl Friston, a professor of imaging neuroscience at University College London and a panellist on the Independent Sage group with special responsibility for modelling, said: “Roughly speaking, the number of new cases per day is between four and eight times the number of confirmed cases.”UCL’s own modelling had a strong correlation with Edge’s results, leading Friston to say there was “pleasing consilience” between the two models."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451433.1609931245!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a how brexit has impacted online shopping from the uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tYou can expect to pay more for the goods  you buy from British-based websites.

Photograph: Crispin Rodwell The route, which limits traffic on the coastal road to one lane, is due to open in February for a six-month trial. However, several residents groups say they believe the council’s proposal requires planning permission and are preparing a submission to ask the board to adjudicate on the issue.Legal representatives for the groups, which include STC ( Serpentine Avenue Tritonville Road, Claremont), Samra (Sandymount \u0026amp Merrion Residents Association) and several associations representing inidual roads in Sandymount, have written to Dublin City Council advising it should not go ahead with the cycle trial in advance of the board’s ruling.However, the council said the cycle path was exempt from requiring planning permission. The project was in line with Government advice to implement walking and cycling schemes during the Covid-19 pandemic, it said. The council had engaged independent consultants who confirmed there was no requirement for environmental assessments which could trigger an application to An Bord Pleanála, it said. Further adviceCouncillors will on Monday be told that following the communication from the residents’ groups, the council would seek further advice on the issue before implementing the trial next month, but it believes “it is correct to proceed with the scheme as originally advised”.Fine Gael councillors Paddy McCartan and James Geoghegan and Labour councillor Dermot Lacey will on Monday propose an emergency motion calling on Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan to revive a 2015 plan to construct a cycle path on a boardwalk over the sea side of Strand Road, instead of on the road itself.The motion also “resolves to reduce the current community isions that have arisen as a consequence of the proposed trial by whatever means necessary”.While several residents groups are opposing the council’s cycle plans, almost 3,000 people last year responded to a public consultation process on the proposal, with 56 per cent “strongly in favour” of proceeding with the trial. Just over a quarter (27 per cent) objected to the trial, while 17 per cent stated they had some concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4454682.1610296501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it needed to be said public praise for varadkar rounding on nphet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar’s criticism of chief medical officer Tony Holohan and the Nphet  on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live was praised by many. Photograph: RTÉ screenshotTánaiste Leo Varadkar’s criticism of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live programme in October was supported by most people who wrote to him over his remarks.Newly disclosed emails from the public show the vast majority of people who felt compelled to write to the Tánaiste about his remarks backed him after a television appearance that showed, for the first time, very public ision between the Government and its public health advisers.Some 55 people who wrote to Mr Varadkar supported his condemnation of Nphet for making its sudden proposal that Level 5 restrictions be imposed to suppress the spread of coronavirus.Thirteen people criticised the Tánaiste for saying he did not feel Nphet’s proposal “had been thought through” and that the leaked advice from chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and other members advising a move to Level 5 had blindsided them “to land something like this on a Sunday night, without prior consultation”.CriticismA number of emails took issue with Mr Varadkar for personalising the situation when he said that while Nphet members were qualified in health matters, none “would have faced being on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment” or having to tell somebody they were losing their job.Despite Mr Varadkar’s criticism, the Government eventually agreed to move Ireland to Level 5 restrictions later in October in response to an increasing number of virus cases.The identities of the people emailing the Tánaiste’s Oireachtas email address in response to his TV appearance on October 5th were not disclosed by his office when they were released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act.The owner of a “small green company” who employs 14 people in the west of the country praised Mr Varadkar, writing that he was “perfectly correct” in his remarks and that the “voice of small business” gets “completely drowned out”.“I find it unbelievable that anything you said was in any way upsetting for anyone. It was about time someone was brave enough to speak a few home truths,” she said.One inidual told the Tánaiste he said “what a lot of people are saying” and that it “needed to be said” because “never having experienced any pushback, Nphet appeared to believe they were actually running the country”.“It is time somebody spoke sense about this crisis,” said another person who emailed Mr Varadkar.“There has to be balance between managing the pandemic and managing the needs of the Irish people socially and economically.”The owner of a Co Galway menswear shop told the Tánaiste that his staff and “most people I speak to are in absolute dread of another shutdown” and did not see it as a credible long-term strategy.“We need as a society to find ways of dealing with Covid in the long term and that is where Nphet’s activity should be concentrated,” they wrote.One person emailed the Tánaiste congratulating him on his performance on the programme, adding that there was “at last some recognition for those with alternative views to those of ‘infallible’ Nphet”.Another writer asked Mr Varadkar to consider the “detrimental impact” of any “circuit breaker lockdowns on the people” after her husband lost his job for three months in the March lockdown.“On Sunday night after I saw the news, my stomach felt sick, I cried, I panicked. I was not able to eat or drink. I slept for one hour with worry,” she wrote.“My chest felt like it was about to explode and I was about to have a heart attack. I felt like the whole world was caving in with worry and anxiety.”There was also strong criticism of the Tánaiste’s remarks in the emails received, with one telling Mr Varadkar he was “really disappointed by the manner in which you threw Dr Tony Holohan to the wolves”.“When the country heard Tony’s voice we felt safe, well informed, treated as adults and trusted his judgment. Tonight you totally undermined the man,” wrote the member of the public.Another inidual compared Mr Varadkar’s public disagreement with Dr Holohan to the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the previous week, likening the Tánaiste to being “Trump last night and Tony Holohan Biden.”“It was not a pretty sight,” said the complainant.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178At least 25 domestic terrorism cases opened as result of deadly assault on US CapitolWhat is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and can it be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?Five dead in US Capitol riot after Donald Trump\u0026#39s supporters storm Washington - everything we know Inauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and will Trump attend?What is impeachment and can Donald Trump be removed from office?Airport security stepped up for members of congressCan I meet my friends outside?

As Covid 19 vaccine roll-outs finally get underway around the planet, world leaders have loftily insisted that all that really matters is the safety of humankind.But while it may be the turning point in the fight against the virus, roll-out time also presents politicians with another grim reality of pandemic politics: namely, are other countries vaccinating faster than us?In the past month, Britain, America and dozens of other nations have begun their long-awaited vaccination programmes, amid national fanfare. But as health ministries pump out statistics on how many arms have been jabbed, a league table has gradually formed, with certain countries far outstripping others. It has led to celebrations in some nations - and excuses, finger-pointing and mudslinging in others...Currently top of the vaccination league is Israel, which last weekend became the first country in the world to have treated 10 per cent of its population.Since then, it has surged to 17.5 per cent, with nearly 1.6 million of the country\u0027s 8.9 million citizens treated. It is a rate that few other countries are anywhere close to achieving: Britain and the US, for example, are still only at just over two per cent of their populations.  Experts attribute Israel\u0027s success to its highly-digitised health service and relatively small population, who are also well-drilled in crisis response. Not surprisingly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has basked in reflected glory, describing his country as a world champion in vaccinations.For all the criticism of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump\u0027s response to Covid, both Britain and America are near the top in the league in terms of sheer numbers of jabs dished out. America\u0027s total of 7 million jabs since December 14 is the highest of any country. Second comes China, which has done 4.5 million, but began rolling out its vaccine much earlier in September, using a vaccine restricted to frontline workers.The UK then comes fourth after Israel, on nearly 1.5 million. That puts it ahead of the European Union\u0027s leader, Germany, which is on 476,000. Trailing spectacularly behind, meanwhile, is France, where the tally thus far of just 80,000 has already become a national scandal.Already, those who are lagging behind slightly are finding themselves on the defensive.  The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused Britain last week of cutting corners on safety standards - just days before then announcing that he would bring Australia\u0027s vaccine roll-out program forward from March to February.And in Wales, which has vaccinated proportionately fewer people than the rest of the UK, First Minister Mark Drakeford insisted on Friday that it was not a competition.  While Britain\u0027s league performance may cheer Brexiteers, European nations have been quick to point out that its lead over the Continent is partly down to its decision to grant early approval of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine on December 2.That was well ahead of the EU\u0027s medical regulator, which did not authorise it until December 21. The delay was partly to ensure equable supplies to all member states, in what EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described as a sign of EU unity.Yet despite an EU spokesman insisting once again that it was not a competition, the lag left some Europeans unimpressed. In Germany, there was bafflement that a vaccine developed on home soil - BioNTech is a German firm - was withheld locally while being dished out in Britain.“The world is celebrating the BioNTech vaccine developed in Germany, fumed the tabloid Bild newspaper. Yet Britain, Canada and the USA have started vaccinating - and we are standing and gawping.”While Germans can at least blame EU regulators, the league table has forced other European nations to acknowledge shortcomings. France, in particular, has admitted unjustified tardiness after just 516 people were vaccinated in the first week of the French program from Dec 27.Despite being the birthplace of Louis Pasteur, France is notoriously vaccine-sceptic: some 46 per cent of French adults say they would refuse to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, compared to just 21 per cent of Britons. So instead of setting up big vaccination drop-in centres, the French strategy has relied mainly on GPs surgeries, where doctors can be on hand to offer reassurance. But that has simply slowed things even more, according to Paris-based psychologist Marie-Estelle Dupont.“The government scored an own goal in thinking that going slowly would reassure sceptics, she told France\u0027s LCI TV. In fact it only worsened their sense of distrust.Even more embarrassed are the Dutch, a pragmatic, well-organised nation who might normally be vying with the Israelis for top in the league. Instead, they only began rolling out their vaccine programme on Wednesday - ten days after the rest of Europe. Health officials have blamed the delays partly on having to upgrade their sophisticated IT system, which has proved ill-suited to radical shake-ups. Meanwhile, the Dutch health minister, Hugo de Jonge, has said he is prioritising safety, and that - yet again - it is not a competition.But not many Dutch are buying into that. Last week, the main opposition leader, Geert Wilders, said the Netherlands looked like “the village idiot of Europe.” And Mark Rutte, the prime minister, told parliament: “I’m very disappointed that we are two weeks behind other countries.Last week, Belgium\u0027s deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, accused Britain, Israel, Russia and China of cutting safety measures to get ahead in the league table. They were, she said, using vaccines that do not have the same standard as the ones we use”. Britain retorted that it was using the same vaccines as the EU, and had merely approved them quicker.But might she have a point about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, or China\u0027s Sinopharm? Both jabs have been rolled in their respective countries since the summer, with Vladimir Putin\u0027s own daughter receiving Sputnik V in August. This is despite not finishing final clinical trials, and despite doubts in the West about the transparency of the clinical data. Yet so far, neither vaccine appears to have caused any major calamities.Sputnik is now also being rolled out in Argentina, Belarus, and Bolivia, while Sinopharm is being used in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Last month, British drugmaker AstraZeneca also said it would start trials to blend its own vaccine with Sputnik V, aiming to emulate the latter\u0027s higher effectiveness rate. That alone was seen as an endorsement of the Russian product.Of the 10 billion vaccine doses pre-ordered worldwide, half have been snapped up by high-income countries that account for just one-eighth of the world\u0027s 7.5bn people. Thanks to the World Health Organisation\u0027s Covax program - designed to ensure “fair and equitable access” - 1.3bn doses have already been earmarked for 92 low and middle-income countries in the first half of 2020.  But some WHO officials fear that some poorer nations may still be waiting as late as 2024. And vaccine nationalism - whereby governments put their own people first - may play a part. Last week, India\u0027s Serum Institute, a pharmaceutical giant that has the main Covax manufacturing contract, was forced to deny reports that the government was insisting that it prioritised Indian nationals.Vaccine nationalism will continue and will be based on who can pay, even though it goes against every principle of a global health system, said Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics. The gap may, though, get covered by new vaccines that eventually become available for non-high income markets.Yet everyone, rich and poor, has an interest in seeing the whole world get jabbed. For if large populations are left untreated, the virus will never go away, and could even mutate into more dangerous, drug-resistant strains. Competitive or not, the league table is a race where everyone must cross the finish line - otherwise, there will be no winners at all.  Read more: How the super rich are getting desperate to access the Covid vaccineMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"democrats could delay sending impeachment proceedings senate","story":"The US Democrats could delay an impeachment trial of Donald Trump until after Joe Biden\u0027s first 100 days in office, a top official said, freeing up the incoming president to pursue his early agenda. James Clyburn, House Majority Whip, said that the House would take up articles of impeachment against Mr Trump this week, but that they would likely not send them to the Senate for several months.The third-ranking  House Democrat said this would allow senators to concentrate on approving Biden administration appointments and tackle legislative priorities such as a second coronavirus relief package.“Let\u0027s give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,” Mr Clyburn told CNN, adding that Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker who controls the timetable of proceedings, was in agreement.Ms Pelosi issued a statement on Sunday night announcing she would give Mike Pence, Vice President, 24 hours to begin the process to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr Trump from office. If he chooses not to, the House will begin impeachment proceedings.Momentum for impeaching Mr Trump a historic second time was growing over the weekend among rank-and-file Democrats and some Republicans.Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, announced the article of impeachment drafted by him and other House Democrats had drawn more than 190 co-sponsors.Senator Patrick Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, spoke out, saying that Mr Trump had “committed impeachable offences,” a sign of growing anger over the outgoing president’s role in the January 6 assault on the US Capitol building.More senior Republicans, however, have urged the Democratic-led House not to initiate proceedings, calling them unnecessary and inflammatory and risked creating further ide.The article of impeachment is due to be introduced to the House on Monday and is likely to be voted on there as early as Wednesday morning.With a vote likely to pass the next step is for a Senate trial. At least 17 Republicans would have to join the Democrats to win a conviction, which would prevent Mr Trump from running again for office.However, Alan Dershowitz, a prominent attorney who has previously represented the president, questioned whether such a move was legally permissible.He said that even if Mr Trump is impeached, the Senate will not be able to hear a trial because he would be a private citizen by the time that were to happen.Another idea being considered is to have a separate vote that would prevent Mr Trump from ever holding office again. That could potentially only need a simple majority vote of 51 senators, unlike impeachment, in which two-thirds of the 100-member Senate must support a conviction.Pat Toomey, Republican senator for Pennsylvania, indicated that he might support such a vote: I think the president has disqualified himself from ever certainly serving in office again, he said. I don\u0027t think he is electable in any way.An Ipsos poll for Reuters showed that 57 per cent of Americans want Mr Trump removed immediately, including nine out of ten Democrats polled, but just two in ten Republicans.A disturbing video from the riots emerged on Sunday night, showing a police officer being viciously beaten by a mob attempting to break into the Capitol.The officer is seen being pulled to the ground before being punched, kicked and even hit at one point with an American flag. He managed to escape and get out of the crowd but he was injured.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germany accused breaching eu rules purchasing supplies vaccine","story":"Germany has come in for criticism over a bilateral vaccine deal with PfizerBiontech to secure an extra 30 million doses of its vaccine at a time when talks between Brussels and the pharma firms were still ongoing.Berlin ordered the extra doses of the vaccine back in September at a time when it was trumpeting the virtues of a common EU purchasing strategy during its role as rotating president of the European Union.German Health Minister Jens Spahn confirmed last week that he had purchased an extra 30 million doses of the vaccine in a separate bilateral agreement with the company.The terms of the EU’s vaccine strategy, published in June, state that the 27 member states agree “not to launch their own procedures for advance purchase of that vaccine with the same manufacturers.” The pact was supposed to be an act of solidarity towards smaller members with weaker purchasing power.The European Commission on Friday avoided being drawn on whether Germany had breached the terms of the agreement, with a spokesman asking reporters to address the question to German authorities.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said though that the member states had agreed that “there will be no parallel negotiations or parallel contracts.”A report in Politico suggests that Germany purchased the additional doses of the comparatively expensive PfizerBiontech vaccine after failing to convince other EU states back in September of the need to buy a further 100 million doses.Biontech is based in the German city of Mainz and received €375 million in funding from the German government in September to help accelerate its research into a corona vaccine. The EU eventually signed a deal to purchase 200 million doses of the vaccine in November. On Friday it announced plans to extend its purchases of the vaccine to a total of 600 million doses. Mr Spahn has come under intense pressure from both the media and the opposition inside Germany over his ministry’s vaccine purchase scheme. The Social Democrats (SPD), who are junior partner’s to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in government, accused Mr Spahn (CDU) of being responsible for “chaos” due to his alleged failure to purchase adequate doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the country\u0027s 83 million residents.SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last week demanded answers from Mr Spahn on 24 separate points including one asking “why doses which were not bought up by the EU were not instead ordered for Germany.”Mr Scholz is the SPD’s pick to run for Chancellor in September’s federal election. The CDU responded furiously to the SPD’s attack, accusing their coalition partner of switching into campaigning mode during a time of national crisis.“The SPD have strayed from the path of rationality,” CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said. “This is counterproductive and only sows more doubt during our struggle with the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ghetto president pop star politician bobi wine leads youthquake","story":"When Ugandan presidential candidate Bobi Wine addressed a crowd in the eastern town of Mbale on Thursday it was more like a rockstar in his pomp than an election campaign stop.Blocked by security forces from reaching the centre of town, a thousands-strong crowd of supporters cheered, sang, chanted and clapped at a decrepit sports ground on the edge of town when Wine, whose real name is Robert Kagyulanyi, dressed in bullet proof vest and ballistic helmet, clambered on top of a car and began a call and response.“People power,” he called out. “Our power,” the jubilant crowd replied.At home on any stage - be it a concert venue or car roof - the charismatic 38-year-old pop star-turned politician is proving to be an unexpectedly strong challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in polls set for 14 January.But in scenes that have become emblematic of a bloody and chaotic eight-week campaign, as Wine’s convoy left Mbale they were engulfed in clouds of tear gas fired by police aiming to disrupt his program for the day and disperse his eager supporters.Mr Museveni himself came to power not in an election but at the head of a rebel army following a brutal civil war, indeed the East African nation has never had a peaceful transfer of power since independence from Britain in 1962.Long before he was elected to parliament in 2017 Wine was known as “His Excellency, the Ghetto President”, a mark of respect for the one-time bad boy who grew up in one of the capital’s largest slums but matured into a thoughtful commentator on social ills and spread his message through lyrical Afrobeat music.In the early days of his reign Mr Museveni himself recognised the dangers of autocracy.“The problem of Africa in general and Uganda in particular is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power,” he wrote in 1986.Now, 35 years later, having gutted the constitution of term and age limits,  Mr Museveni is seeking another five years in office in what is increasingly likely to be a presidency for life for the 76-year-old who rules one of the world\u0027s youngest populations.In previous elections, US and EU observer missions have been highly critical of the process and the bias of the nominally independent Electoral Commission.Observer mission recommendations aimed at eliminating ballot stuffing and electronic vote rigging have never been implemented, leading analysts to conclude that the lack of a level playing field all but guarantees a win for Mr Museveni.“I’m a musician, yo, who became a spokesperson of my generation... they felt represented through my lyrics”, Wine explains in an exclusive interview with The  at his home outside the capital, Kampala, on Saturday.“More than eighty five percent of our population have never seen another president. General Museveni connects with people aged seventy five and above. He’s a representation of history, I’m a representation of the future and we demand the right to live our own lives, to make our own mistakes, to write our own story.”Using the pandemic as justification, state authorities announced stringent campaigning rules which initially appeared set to quieten Wine’s voice while rough tactics were employed to stop radio and television stations broadcasting his message.However, to the consternation of the intelligence services, Wine’s crew of music producers and technicians quickly adapted and began live streaming their campaign on newly established YouTube channels and Facebook pages, prompting the government to unsuccessfully request the US-based tech companies censor them.Ugandan political analyst Angelo Izama says that Bobi Wine’s popularity “represents - at a deep level - a structural shift, a generational shift” driven by urbanisation, demographics and sky-high youth unemployment.That shift has important lessons for other societies led by strongmen who present themselves as their country’s only viable ruler.Museveni has reacted to the challenge from the fresh young entertainer with “militarism on steroids” according to Izama.From the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM) political party’s violent response “you would think there is a major insurrection underway, which is typical of late-stage autocracy” explains Izama.That was evident during two days of unrest in November, triggered by Wine’s arrest on the pretext of violating coronavirus rules, when security forces killed at least 54 people in Kampala and surrounding towns.Desperate for change, young demonstrators faced-off against heavily armed soldiers and burly gunmen in plainclothes with devastating consequences.Protests from non-governmental organizations and foreign diplomats were dismissed by security chiefs and party apparatchiks but, in any event, Wine does not hold the professional civil society in high esteem.“I don\u0027t see the professors, the doctors, the lawyers, those who studied economics and political science, I don’t see them” working for change, Wine said.“I see them scared or compromised, complacent about the situation. But young, deprived people from the ghetto see that I’m not only talking about change, I am change, I represent change.”The dynamics driving Uganda’s fraught election echo isions in countries led by fellow strongmen from the Philippines’ brutal Rodrigo Duterte to Egypt’s general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.Disaffected youths yearn for fundamental change to drive improvements in public services and crack open money making opportunities monopolized by elite cartels, while older voters who value perceived stability and those who benefit from regime patronage argue the benefits of the status quo.In Uganda the odds are stacked against a change at the top and as polling day draws near Bobi Wine reflects on an election campaign that has seen dozens killed, hundreds arrested and Wine’s children sent to the US for their safety.“Many times I look around and think, oh my god, what the hell did I get myself into, what the hell did I get people’s children into?” Wine ponders.“But I’m soon reminded that it’s all worth it. It’s more dangerous to do nothing”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic has increased ambulance waiting times fivefold says","story":"The NHS is seeking to “shame doctors” for also working in private hospitals during the second coronavirus wave, it has emerged.Amid unprecedented pressure due to the pandemic, bosses in London have told NHS hospitals to try to put a stop to clinicians working in both sectors.In a leaked letter, NHS England’s Regional Medical Director NHS England and NHS Improvement for London, Vin Diwakar, also criticises independent hospitals for continuing to carry out non-urgent treatment.It came as the number of coronavirus patients in hospitals in England stood at a record 29,346 as of 8am on Friday, up by 30 per cent from a week ago.Last week Mr Diwakar warned that the NHS in London would be overwhelmed within a fortnight, even in a best-case scenario.In a subsequent memo to trust bosses he said: “We are in genuinely unprecedented times and the second wave of Covid-19 is putting pressures on the service that only a year ago would have been unthinkable.“In this context, with all but the most urgent elective activity postponed in the NHS in London, it feels profoundly uncomfortable to us that some elective work, that is not time critical, is continuing in the independent sector.”He added: “We are asking colleagues to think very carefully about the appropriateness of this, and would like colleagues not to support delivery of such work in the independent sector for a period of time, a month from the date of this letter in the first instance, until vaccination and the current lockdown take effect and the pressure on NHS services eases.”During the first wave of the pandemic all private hospitals in London signed up to a block contract with NHS England, making all their resources available to the health service.This ended in August, and was replaced by a series of piecemeal contracts, allowing the sector to recommence non-NHS work.Health chiefs in the capital were last week desperately trying to negotiate deals with private hospitals to take on some NHS cancer surgery, it was reported.Now, in the Health Service Journal reports sources saying that senior NHS officials are “incensed” private hospitals are continuing to offer non-urgent treatment during the second wave, and that the sector needed to be “shamed” into providing more help.On Sunday, it emerged the pressure is now so great on ambulance services that patients who have suffered a fall at home are waiting five times longer for treatment than they should.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the College of Paramedics, said pressures of the coronavirus pandemic have left people with non-life-threatening injuries writhing in agony for up to 10 hours waiting for an ambulance to arrive.This comes on top of escalating waiting times once ambulances actually reach hospitals due to the shortage of beds.The warning comes days after West Midlands Ambulance Service endured its busiest ever day on 5,383 emergency calls last Monday.Ms Nicholls said while category one life-threatening call-out times do not yet appear to have suffered delays, the response time for some category three call-outs now exceed the length of a working day.These calls are classified as urgent, which require relief from suffering and transport to a hospital or clinical management at the scene.NHS rules state ambulance services must respond to at least 90 per cent of such calls within two hours.Ms Nicholls said: “We are very used to seeing ambulance services take some strain over the winter months due to the normal pressures we would see any particular year. But this year particularly has seen incredible pressure because of the clinical presentation of the patients our members are seeing. They are sicker.”Ms Nicholls said: “We are seeing the ambulance handover delays at a scale we haven’t seen before.” Ms Nicholls said that, while there “does not appear” to be a delay in ambulance response times for category one life-threatening call-outs, there is for category three and four calls.“Category three calls would be things like abdominal pains or falls, and some of those patients in those high-pressure areas have waited up to 10 hours,” she said.David Hare, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: “The independent sector is providing significant support to the NHS with millions of NHS patients treated since the onset of the pandemic in March.  “Since the end of the block-booked ‘at cost’ national arrangements NHS England has asked independent hospitals to focus on delivering urgent and non-urgent elective care underpinned by private activity.  “It is becoming increasingly clear that the NHS once again needs supporting in a much more significant and flexible way. That now requires an urgent reassessment by the NHS centrally of how to give local NHS systems the independent sector support they now need.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures weekendplough sunday birth baby orangutan","story":"Reverend Andrew Birk from Chidham Parish in West Sussex dons his wellington boots to continue the ancient tradition known as Plough Sunday.

However the safety conscious Duke has opted for the artwork to be  hung in a part of the castle only accessible through a secret doorway, with visitors required to climb two sets of stairs to reach it.  A documentary named My Rembrandt shows the Duke’s concerns after his £4.25million Madonna of the Yarnwinder was snatched in 2003 by two visitors to Drumlanrig Castle, in Dumfries and Galloway.The thieves had bought tickets to tour the castle before grabbing the painting and making off with it into the southern Scottish hills. During the documentary, Taco Dibbits, the director general of the museum, tells the duke: “It is too high up and the intimacy it has now is lost.”The Duke responds “Our beautiful, lovely, glorious lady...she hangs high and out of reach because in 2003 we had an awful theft from the castle. “There was a Leonardo painting which hung downstairs. They were side by side.“My father was so shaken by what happened that he decided that she should instead hang high up on a higher floor. But it is a great sadness because you can’t really see and enjoy her.”The Leonardo has since been recovered and is now on loan to National Galleries of Scotland. It was found during a police raid of the offices of a law firm in Glasgow.Five men were tried and acquitted of threatening to destroy the masterpiece unless they were paid £4.25 million in 2010. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sage advice sixties budding cooks pursuit love","story":"The reputations of journalists are ephemeral – we write for deadlines rather than posterity, even if Gabriel García Márquez said that he would rather be remembered for his journalism than for One Hundred Years of Solitude.The journalist Katherine Whitehorn, who died last week aged 92, will rightly be celebrated for her pioneering columns, whose elegance and wit belied their subversive observations of women’s place in society. But my favourite part of her written legacy is her book, Cooking in a Bedsitter, published in 1961.If Whitehorn’s columns reflected the spirit of the age, Bedsitter expressed that spirit in edible form. It occupies an honoured place in the long history of instruction manuals for would-be cooks trying to make good food when time, budget and kitchen facilities are limited.Endearingly larky though it is, with its merry insistence that cooking is a joy, not a chore, Bedsitter is also impressively ahead of its time. Ready meals were in their infancy when it was published (it shared its 1961 debut with Vesta curries and McDonald’s), yet Whitehorn took a cheerfully unsnobbish view of convenience food.In a 2016 interview to mark the adaptation of Bedsitter as a BBC Radio 4 comedy drama, she recalled feeding devils on horseback, made with tinned oysters, to the exigent cook and food purist Elizabeth David, who ate them up without complaint.Her book is also timelessly brilliant on the role of food in seduction: don’t try too hard, don’t be too casual, she advised. Sixty years on, it remains sage counsel for people in pursuit of love, especially the advice, offered in capitals in Bedsitter, NOT to ask your date to wash up.Viewers of Michaela Coel’s 2020 BBC drama, I May Destroy You, will recall its depiction of the emotional connections between cooking and love, which are pure Whitehorn.These days we are assailed with a multiplicity of food options – so overwhelming that the essentials can be lost in the blare of culinary chatter. Whitehorn’s Bedsitter is of its time, but it is also a clarion call to the joy of what can be achieved with a frying pan, a sharp knife, ingenuity and a longing for good food. Someone should bring it back, gently updated, to inspire a new generation of nascent cooks.Accustomed as she was to making do, Whitehorn was well acquainted with the lockdown vogue for WFB – or working from bed. “It amazes me to think that all my articles until 1965 were written sitting on our bed,” she wrote.Beds as workplaces have a distinguished lineage: Winston Churchill worked tirelessly from his bed, while Lady Diana Cooper conducted a brilliant post-war social salon from Pauline Borghese’s bed in the French Embassy in Paris, where her husband was ambassador.As a sickly child, I loved Robert Louis Stevenson’s poem “The Land of Counterpane”, in which a bedridden child imagines his toys enacting heroic adventures among his bedclothes. I haven’t yet embraced WFB – my desk remains a corner of the kitchen table – but an archaeologist excavating my own land of counterpane would discover a wicker bed tray (I was an early adopter), a toy ferret (a freebie from a ferret food company) and innumerable books.As a Pompeii-style snapshot of a life, it is alarmingly accurate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools closed new lockdown when reopen uk areas covid","story":"All primary and secondary schools have closed, after England moved into a third national lockdown.The Prime Minister said schools will need to offer remote learning until at least mid-February and GCSE and A-level exams face cancellation for a second year.Only vulnerable children and children of key workers will be allowed to attend schools for face-to-face learning, and early years settings such as nurseries will remain accessible.Boris Johnson said the new measures were necessary: because we have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.However, Mr Johnson remains very cautious about the timetable, with restrictions being lifted as a gradual unravelling. Those entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them during closures, and more devices will be distributed to help remote learning, according to Mr Johnson.The Government had insisted schools would remain open only a day before the new measures were announced, reassuring parents it was safe to send their children back for the start of term on January 4.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay seen across London to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England has called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.The  reported on January 9 that education experts warned that Britain needed to massively expand its army of tutors to stave off the long-term economic damage of Covid-19 from lost learning.The Department for Education (DfE) said children with at least one parent or carer who was a critical worker could attend class - even if parents were working from home.It came after concerns were raised about the risks of transmission of Covid-19 amid reports that more than half of pupils were onsite in some primary schools.A DfE spokesperson said: Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.But Government guidance says parents who choose to keep children out of class will not be penalised.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children.The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least the February half-term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being finetuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and (very rarely) the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"adults receive vaccine byautumn jab hubs open doors","story":"Every adult in the UK will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by the autumn, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said ahead of unveiling the jab roll-out plan on Monday.Seven regional mass vaccine hubs will open their doors at sports stadiums and business centres across England on Monday morning, with the Health Secretary set to pay a visit to one.These large-scale sites, which can deliver thousands of jabs each week, will initially administer the vaccine to the over-80s and frontline health and care staff.Members of the public have been advised against trying to book an appointment at the hubs, which are based at sites including the London Nightingale Hospital, Bristol’s Ashton Gate stadium and Manchester’s Etihad tennis club.The NHS is instead contacting 600,000 people aged over 80 who live within a 45-minute drive from one of the centres to invite them to take up a slot. On Sunday, Mr Hancock revealed that around two million jabs have been administered so far.He disclosed that more than 200,000 people a day were receiving a dose and that a third of those aged over 80 had been given the jab.On Monday afternoon he will set out full details of the Government’s vaccines delivery plan at a Downing Street press conference.The NHS has trained 80,000 vaccinators. It is understood that the majority are health service staff, but thousands of volunteers from St John Ambulance have also been enlisted.There are 1,000 vaccination sites set up across the UK, with a further 200 expected to be established by the end of the week.These include GP-led centres, where the majority of jabs are expected to take place, as well as hospitals and the regional mass hubs.The mass centres, which have also been set up at Epsom racecourse in Surrey, Millennium Point in Birmingham, Robertson House in Stevenage and the Centre for Life in Newcastle, could expand to 50 eventually under Government plans.The whole nation will have been offered a jab within months, Mr Hancock signalled on Sunday.“Every adult will be offered the vaccine by the autumn, absolutely”, he told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show and confirmed that this applied to all Britons aged 18 or over.  The over-50s are due to be vaccinated by the spring, while the 13 million most vulnerable are set to receive their first dose of the jab by February 15 under the Government’s timetable.This includes care home residents and staff, all Britons aged over 75, those between 70 and 75 who are clinically extremely vulnerable, and frontline health and social care workers.Setting an optimistic tone, the Health Secretary said the nation could look forward to a “brilliant summer” and told Times Radio: “I’ve booked my cottage in Cornwall.”He acknowledged that coronavirus jabs would continue to be needed in future, saying it\u0027s “highly likely” Britons would require a vaccine each year.He raised the prospect of the UK introducing a “dual vaccination programme” with jabs to protect against both coronavirus and flu in coming years.He said: “From today, the full scale of our plans will be published, so the public can be assured of the time, effort and resources that have gone and will go into ensuring we protect the British people from the scourge of this virus.  “The UK vaccine delivery plan will be the keystone of our exit out of the pandemic, but we all must continue to play our part by staying at home, following the rules and keeping hands, face, space at the forefront of our minds when out and about.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bosses urged give staff paid","story":"NewsBosses urged to give staff paid time off to get Covid- vaccineLabours Angela Rayner wrote to the \"big \" business groups, encouraging them to make it easier for staff to get the jabmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JAN NewsEmployers are being urged to encourage their workers to sign up as NHS volunteers \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to the ‘Big ’ business groups – the CBI, BCC, FSB, IOD and MakeUK – to urge them to help. “Too many good businesses have struggled, too many people have lost their jobs and the longer this crisis lasts the deeper the economic damage will be,” she said. Figures from the OBR show that the Covid crisis is costing the economy over £ billion and , job losses every week. Ms Rayner wrote: “We all have a role to play, and Britain’s businesses can support this national effort... “I know that you share this commitment to ensuring that the vaccine is rolled out as quickly as possible. “You will know first-hand how damaging delays will be to our economy and to businesses.

Curfews Nurseries being closed Support bubbles being banned The public told to wear masks outside Exercise limited to one hour.Boris Johnson announced a new national lockdown last week, which is expected to last at least until the end of February, and possibly beyond.March rd, the anniversary of the first lockdown, has been touted as the first realistic date for restrictions to be lted.Mr Hancock refused to be drawn on the possibility of even tougher restrictions being necessary to drive down rates. He told the BBC: “I don’t want to speculate because the most important message is not whether the Government will further strengthen the rules.“The most important thing is that people stay at home and follow the rules that we have got.“And that, in terms of the scale of the impact on the cases, that is the most important thing we can do collectively as a society.”But Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said existing measures might have to be tightened further. He warned the country was “now in the eye of a storm” with the pandemic.“Now we’re in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky so we are going to have to be very, very strict about the measures,” he said.“Whether the current restrictions are enough, I think it remains to be seen.“It will be a week or two before it becomes clear.“They may be sufficient but we have to be very vigilant andthere’s any sign that they’re not, then we’re going to have to be even stricter I’m afraid.” Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of public health at Edinburgh University, said that lockdown in the UK should continue for the next  weeks.She said: “With the numbers we’re at, there’s no other choice.”Labour leader Keir Starmer also admitted the current lockdown rules “may not be tough enough”.He added: “They are tough and they’re necessary. They may not be tough enough.” But his deputy, Angela Rayner, pointed the finger of blame at the Government for the lack of compliance with the rules. She tweeted: “I don’t think the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary understand how damaging their disgraceful defence of Dominic Cummings breaking lockdown rules was for public trust.” Government scientists are concerned that even with schools closed they may struggle to drive down the R rate - the infection rate - below one.No  sources said ministers discussed how to boost compliance with the rules, lower than during the first lockdown, amid fears of lockdown fatigue. And they underlined the importance of tough enforcement for the small number of people that were breaking them. The Covid  meeting, led by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, also discussed the latest data from hospitals showing how many are on the brink of being overwhelmed.Last night, Independent Sage member, Prof Deenan Pillay, said hospital capacity was at risk “due to a year of sub-optimal response from Government.” Fellow member Anthony Costello, a professor of global health at UCL and a former WHO director, said that only “a total clampdown” would be enough to stop the virus. He said: “We are in a national crisis with a pandemic out of control. “We should have no nurseries open, no synagogues, no churches, no mosques. We should have compulsory masks, two-metre distancing. Labour leader Keir starmer admitted the current lockdown rules may not be tough enough. He added: They are tough and theyaposre necessary. They may not be tough enough. He added: In a sense, I think the most important thing is people get that message about stay at home. And itaposs up to the Government to put that message out there the whole time. Weaposve had mixed messages Iaposm afraid for the last nine months which is why weaposve got a problem. I would like to see the Prime Minister out there every day with a press conference making sure that message is absolutely getting through.  Earlier, Mr Hancock backed more stringent enforcement of the lockdown by police and warned that every flexibility of the rules could prove fatal. Matt Hancock said the majority of people are following the rules to stay at home, but he refused to criticise the police over complaints that some forces have been over-zealous in handing out fines. Police tactics have come in for scrutiny after Derbyshire Police handed out £ fines to two women who drove separately to go for a walk at a remote beauty spot situated around five miles from their homes. The constabulary has since confirmed it will be reviewing all fixed penalty notices issued during the new national lockdown in England after it received clarication about the coronavirus regulations from the National Police Chiefsapos Councilfollowing the incident.

The first , invitations asking the elderly to sign up for a jab at the centres, which are scheduled to open this week, were due to arrive over the weekend, with more than , to follow over the next seven days. The letters have been sent to people aged  or older who live between a  to -minute drive from one of seven new regional centres, with information about how they can book a slot either over the phone or via an online national booking service.

Over-s who live  to  minutes drive from one of the sites will be the first invited. The centres are expected to be run by a combination of NHS staff and volunteers. They will be Covid-secure environments and everybody attending is likely to be asked to wear a face-mask. The venues are all large and spacious so social distancing should not be a problem. And there will be lots of hand-sanitiser on offer, with communal areas cleaned regularly. You will be asked to arrive on time for your slot, not early, and to leave immediately afterwards.

Butyou are shielding or have a problem with mobility and can’t travel up to  miles away, you can wait until you’re offered one by your GP.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the whole population will be offered an inoculation by the autumn. Not everybody can get it at once which is why a priority list has been drawn up. Over-s, elderly care home residents, frontline NHS and care staff, and ‘shielders’ will be in the first wave of vaccinations between now and February . Where are the vaccine super-hubs   Seven mass vaccination centres are expected to open this week. London’s Excel Centre and the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre are among the vast venues. Epsom Down’s racecourse in Surrey, Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol, the Centre for Le in Newcastle, Birmingham’s Millennium Point and Robertson House in Stevenage will also operate as major vaccination hubs, staffed by NHS staff and volunteers.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said thatone parent did not work - eventheir partner was a key worker - then their children should stay at home. It comes after the Government changed official advice to say that children of key workers should only attend schooltheir parents can’t work from home in yet another U-turn. And it follows a survey finding one in six primary schools in England had reported % or more of their normal number of children had attended this week - a far higher figure than in the first week of the March lockdown. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs always been the guidance that schools are there for key workersapos children where key workers need to have the children in school in order to be able to get to work. He added: For instance,youaposre a key worker and your partner doesnapost work then you shouldnapost be sending your children to school. “Thataposs clear in the guidance. But of course the reason that we keep schools open for key workersapos children is that this is important. It is important - for instance - that key workers in the NHS but not just the NHS - can get to work and so itaposs a very dficult balance to strike. I understand that more people are sending their children to school than they did last time. But we really do need everybody who works in the NHS where at all possible to be able to make it to work.”  Meanwhile, Mr Hancock defended the governmentaposs repeated claims that schools are safe, despite closing them down - a decision which has been branded confusing. He said: Schools are safe for children. The risk to children is extremely low and thereaposs no evidence of more teachers catching Covid than any other profession. So that means schools are safe.

The Health Secretary said more than , vaccines a day are being administered in the UK, and the country is on course to deliver  million vaccines a week. He told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr: The good news is that over the last week weaposve vaccinated more people than in the whole of December. But he accepted that to be effective, vaccines would have to be given to people in their s and s as well as the highest priority patients. Askedthe UK would be able to vaccinate everybody by the autumn, Mr Hancock said: Yes. He added: Every adult will be offered a vaccine by the autumn, absolutely. I totally agree itaposs very, very important. Of course youaposve got to do it according to need, because someone in a care home is many, many times more likely to diethey catch coronavirus than someone like me in my s. But absolutely weaposre going to offer the vaccine to everybody.Weaposve got over  million doses on order, theyaposre not all here yet and weaposre rolling them out as fast as they get delivered.But weaposre going to have enough to offer everyone over the age of  one by the autumn. And Mr Hancock said the Government was on course to reach its target of  million people vaccinated by mid-February. He told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge: Yes weaposre on course. The rate limiting factor at the moment is supply but thataposs increasing. Iaposm very glad to say that at the moment weaposre running at over , people being vaccinated every day. Weaposve now vaccinated around one third of the over-s in this country so weaposre making signicant progress but thereaposs still further expansion to go. This week weaposre opening mass vaccination centres. Big sites for instance at Epsom racecourse, thereaposs seven going live this week with more to come next week where we will get through very large numbers of people. Mr Hancock said the public had been following lockdown rules more in the November lockdown. He did not want to criticise the public as the majority are following the rules. He told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: We are as you can see, with the police, enforcing stringently against the minority who donapost follow the rules. But youaposre right I donapost want to criticise the public because the majority of people are following the rules. Thataposs what we want to see and we can see that the amount of people who are staying at home has increased, but weaposve all got to absolutely follow that guidance. He added: The data shows more people are following the lockdown than the November lockdown. But he said the pressure on the NHS is very, very bad.

I’d just graduated from Nottingham University, and was starting my first day as a junior doctor at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire. I’d stayed up for the after-party and then had to catch the am train from Newcastle to Boston, dragging all my luggage – my Miss England outfit, work clothes and my new crown in its special case – with me. I was trying to focus on the induction, but my phone kept ringing and I was bombarded with emails. By the end of the day, I had a huge blister on my foot and left the hospital with just one shoe on.I’m not sure what the waiting media, outside the building, made of it! I thought to myself, “What a way to become Miss England!” But that’s been typical of my journey to become the country’s first South Asian Miss England. It’s been a question of balancing my geeky, studious side with my other interests – first dancing when I was a teen and now modelling.  I’ve always been independent, travelling all over the country for competitions and castings. One year, when I underperformed in exams, my dad suggested I put modelling on hold.That’s when I told myself, “If I want to do one, I have to do the other right. To be able to dance or model, I have to make sure I do my work too.”My parents, who came to the UK from Kolkata, India, when I was nine, always drummed into me the importance of getting a sensible job.There was an expectation I’d go into medicine – it’s a revered profession in Asian families – but on a personal level I also wanted an academic career. Being a medic keeps you on your toes and I enjoy the feeling when you help fix someone’s problems.  Making a dference Although being a beauty queen and a medic might sound like two very dferent things, in some ways I was drawn to competing in pageants for the same reason.I wanted a  for myself, and I’ve seen a lot of successful women come out of the industry and make a dference in their field of work.The thought of entering Miss England hadn’t occurred to me – it can be complicated for ethnic minority women here who might have an identity crisis about who they represent – until the organisersof Asian Face Of Miss England got in touch.I won that competition, and from there I progressed to Miss England.Beauty pageants have evolved. There’s no swimwear round and Miss England introduced a ground-breaking element this time which had us all turning up in the same outfit, with no make-up on at all.  When you go to castings it’s easy to spend thousands on a look, but not everyone can compete with that. This was about being yourself and it was liberating. Of course, for the finals you put on a glamorous evening dress, but the judgement is made on months of hard work the finalists put in. I had a good feeling, but I wasn’t expecting to win. When you see the standard of all the women competing, your confidence nosees, but you do your best. My victory hit me like a bus – it didn’t feel real! For two months I continued working, but then took a gap year to focus on the Miss World competition in December  in London, and travel opportunities. Suddenly, I was jetting across the world from Turkey to Africa to India, little knowing le was about to be turned upside down for the second time in six months. When the pandemic first started to gather pace, I was in India at the start of a tour of Asia. There was a lockdown and I was stranded in a hotel.My colleagues were messaging me about the Covid- pandemic and how busy the wards were. I felt useless and thought, “I should be doing something right now.”  It sounds weird to describe it as a fear of missing out, but I had a strong sense I wanted to be part of the effort to beat Covid. The country was in the middle of an emergency, and it was the right time to hang up my crown for a while. The transition from beauty queen to medic again was seamless because in my head I knew why I was coming back. The world had changed in the space of just a week. Forming close bonds At the beginning, when we were all unsure where it was all heading, the clapping for the NHS was an amazing, emotional thing. I was just doing my job, but suddenly everyone was on our side. As a result, I formed such a close bond with my colleagues at Pilgrim Hospital. I’m quite an introverted person, and wasn’t expecting to go to work and find such a genuine set of friends. Some even came to watch me compete in Miss World, and because of the fight against the virus, we’ve become even closer. I wrote a poem called Invisible Halo about the unceasing work of the staff, how we support each other, and “fallen heroes” we’d lost during the pandemic. We turned it into a film featuring staff at the hospital, to celebrate their duty, dedication and sacrice. It closes with them taking turns to wear my crown, symbolising that all NHS workers are heroes.Since then I’ve moved on to the Royal Derby Hospital. I work on the urology ward, but when you’re on call any of us can spend time on the Covid wards.Le is a mix of -hour day and night shts and weekends on call.While you’re caring for other people, your own health comes last. Of course, some days I’m tired and I’ll eat the wrong things, and wearing masks makes you prone to breakouts.Everything I do – skincare, diet and exercise – I try to do mindfully, for the long term.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said they are on course to meet the target, with over , people being vaccinated every day in England and a third of over-s already jabbed.

An emotional Harry McKean said he had worked an eight-and-a-half hour day but didnapost even make £. The Glasgow taxi driver has even considered quitting his job to find a new career and said he is worried he wonapost make it through to the other side of the pandemic without financial suppport. He added that he cannot even afford to take out another loan to tide himself over. Speaking in the video filmed inside his cab, Harry said: Nearly three hours now Iaposve been out, not one hire. Yesterday I did an eight-and-a-half sht and recorded £. earnings. Iaposm now going to go home and discuss with the we what way we go forward. Do we hand the taxi back  Do I try and get another job, which would seem highly unlikely. We needed help last year and we still need it even more now. The minimum wage in Scotland is £. per hour and Mr McKean was particularly critical of the lack of support he had received from his own government. He added: This Scottish administration have not put their hand in their pocket once to help us out. The only help weaposve received is from the Westminster Chancellor, Mr Sunak. While itaposs been a great help, itaposs not been enough. We need more. I know there are other people out there people needing the same, but weaposre not a fixed premise, we canapost apply for those grants. We still have fixed costs - I have fixed costs of about £, a month, between taxi payments, insurance and running costs. Do I decide to give that up, go into another job or go into arrears with other payments  We donapost know how weaposre going to go. So Iaposm asking, Iaposm now begging for somebody, somewhere within Holyrood, local council, anywhere, to start looking at this seriously and get us some kind of serious grant.  Because we canapost afford any more loans, we donapost have the earning capacity to pay for them and even further down the line weaposre just going to run up debt that we canapost afford or people just canapost afford to give us the credit these days. Iaposm begging you councillors, you MSPs out there, take a serious look at this industry and get some help out there because we have fixed costs, like business owners with fixed premises do as well. Only  percent of cabbies are still working throughout lockdown, according to the Licensed Taxi Driversapos Association, with hundreds of taxis being kept in fields as their owners have given up their jobs. Steve McNamara, the associationaposs general secretary, said cabbies are earning starvation wages around a quarter of normal levels.

James Mitchell, , would on a typical Friday night eat a chippy dinner for lunch before ordering a large  inch pizza to himself for dinner.The software engineer from Moreton, Merseyside became so heavy that his weighing scales simply said aposerrorapos when he stepped on them, Liverpool Echo reports.I have always been fat I have always been the fat kid of the class ever since I can remember, James said. When I was at school for breakfast it would be sweets from the shop on the way in and maybe a chocolate bar, then chips for lunch, I would maybe get a pizza on the way home and then whatever I would have for tea. I just didnapost care. Because although I was the fat kid in school I was never bullied. As a heavy  year old boy, James was referred to a dietician at Arrowe Park Hospital and scammed the medics by filling his pockets with stones and coins on his first weigh in so they thought he had lost weight next time. His shocking diet continued for the next two decades, and sometimes while away on business James would not think twice about buying his breakfast and lunch at McDonaldaposs before tucking into a mixed grill, a pudding and a few pints at a restaurant. He said: I was fat and happy. It honestly never bothered me. In my head I was absolutely fine. I was not one of these people that hides away in a corner, I would go out,I was on holiday I was happy to take my top off and walk around. I was fine being fat until I wasnapost. In April , James tried to take his dog for a walk but after a few hundred yards he thought he was going to die. This was the realisation James needed as that same day he emptied his cupboards of newly bought biscuits and snacks and poured them into an outside bin. He even poured fizzy drinks down the sink.  James then started working with Dominic Beebee, a weight management consultant with weight loss franchise The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan. He came to ask about my diet and weigh and measure me, James said. I had cut out the chocolate and stuff for about a week at that point and I was st lbs at that stage. But the really embarrassing thing is he said aposIaposm sorry I forgot my measuring tapeapos. I said aposoh I have got one hereapos, it was just a standard measuring tape. Dominic put it around my waist and it didnapost fit, it was around  inches and there was around a six inch gap.  James stuck to the diet and now weighs a trim stlbs. He said: I have gone from being the heaviest in the room to one of the lightest. Dominic said: As a young consultant at the time,  years old, this was my biggest challenge yet.

Englandaposs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has warned the NHS faces the “most dangerous situation” in living memory with record deaths and hospital admissions as a result of the virus. In a bid to curb rising infection rates and ensure the NHS does not become overwhelmed, itaposs believed tougher measures may be introduced. Pressed on possible restrictions, Mr Hancock told the BBC: I donapost want to speculate because the most important message is not whether the Government will further strengthen the rules. The most important thing is that people stay at home and follow the rules that we have got. And that, in terms of the scale of the impact on the cases, that is the most important thing we can do collectively as a society. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer believes lockdown rules “may not be tough enough”, while Prof Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said existing measures might have to be tightened further. He told the BBC: Now weaposre in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky so we are going to have to be very, very strict about the measures. Whether the current restrictions are enough, I think it remains to be seen. It will be a week or two before it becomes clear. They may be sufficient but we have to be very vigilant andthereaposs any sign that theyaposre not, then weaposre going to have to be even stricter Iaposm afraid. A toughening of measures could mean curfews, nurseries being closed, support bubbles being banned, face masks being made compulsory in all busy outdoor areas and exercise limited to one hour. We take a look at what it would meanthese measures are brought in. Curfews Boris Johnson and No failed to rule out a French-style, full-blown curfew when questioned by the BBCaposs Andrew Marr last week.France has introduced a pm order for people tohome in the hardest-hit regions.Indeed, the UK has never imposed a full night-time curfew on its citizens during the coronavirus pandemic.The furthest we went was a pm ‘curfew’ on pub opening times, but people were not forced home after that.  Itaposs unlikely weaposll see a curfew in wales any time soon, however, as Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said today Wales is “not yet in a position” where measures such as curfews need to be imposed. “It’s important for me to say that numbers in Wales have been improving and we are not in the position we were before Christmas, where Wales had the most dficult figures everywhere in the United Kingdom,” Mr Drakeford told BBC Breakfast. “We’re below the figures in Northern Ireland, we’re below the figures in England. “So we’re not yet in a position where we would need to take measures such as curfews but the continuation of the current lockdown regime is necessary in order to relieve the pressure on the NHS.” He added: “We’re not in a position where curfews are – at this point – part of the repertoire of actions we are considering.” Nurseries being closed Schools and universities will remain closed until at least mid-February, but nurseries have so far been unaffected. But many scientists and experts have called for this to change. The Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries and childminders, said some providers are closing despite what the Government has said. Calum Semple, a paediatrician and a fellow member of SAGE, told BBC Breakfast: If we’ve gotten to the point of closing the universities, secondary schools and primary schools on the grounds of public health, then I would be looking to close all other non-essential activities. And it may be that a political decision has been made here that nurseries are essential. But it’s not a scientic one.  Keir Starmer has also said nurseries should “probably” be closed - and claims people are “surprised” that they aren’t. The Labour leader told the BBC: I think there is a case for looking at nursery schools, weaposre talking to the scientists about that.I think people are surprised that primary schools were closed but nurseries arenapost. He added: I think they probably should be closed, I do want to talk to the scientists about that. Support bubbles being banned Millions of people are now reliant on a “support bubble” to see another household they’re close to. The system allows a single-adult household, a couple with a child under one, to permanently bubble up with another household of any size. However, it’s easy to forget this vital policy only began in England in June, after almost three months of lockdown.  Axing support bubbles would take England back to March - but be hugely unpopular and do a lot of damage to people who now rely on that support. It comes after figures showed four in  adults in Britain formed a bubble to celebrate Christmas Day. Some  per cent of adults in England, Scotland and Wales said they formed a Christmas bubble on December , the Office for National Statisticssaid. The same proportion said they had not done so, while  per cent said this was not permitted in their area. The public told to wear masks outside Face coverings may soon be made mandatory in busy public places such as supermarket queues as harsher coronavirus measures are considered by government ministers.London mayor Sadiq Khan declared a major incident in the capital on Friday and called for face coverings to be worn outside.Itaposs thought Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers have been examining the case to extend the use of mask wearing. One government source told The: Thereaposs not a lot more that we can do.Weaposve put in these very tough national restrictions. It is a lockdown for everyone all the time. The source told the newspaper that face masks could become mandatory in busy outdoor areas, while the rapid spread of the new and highly virulent strain of Covid- may also result in stricter social distancing measures. Exercise limited to one hour During the March lockdown, people were limited to “one form of exercise per day”, such as a run, walk or cycle.Contrary to popular belief, this was not time-limited despite Michael Gove suggesting it should be only an hour. Since summer , the “one form of exercise” limit has vanished and people can take unlimited exercise. Earlier this week No refused to rule out bringing back this limit.

Photos show health and care workers being vaccinated inside The Centre for Le in Newcastle, where tens of thousands are expected to be inoculated in coming days. From tomorrow, the first wave of NHS patients will be led through by health service staff and volunteers to receive their first jab. Earlier today Health Secretary Matt Hancock said every adult in the UK will be offered a vaccination by the autumn as authorities desperately try to bring the Covid nightmare to an end. The seven mass vaccination centres, with more expected to follow, are:Robertson House in Stevenage ExCel Centre in London Centre for Le in Newcastle Etihad Tennis Centre in Manchester Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol Millennium Point in BirminghamThe government said it is aiming to offer inoculations to almost  million vulnerable people in the UK by mid-February. More than half a million over-s are due to receive invites this week to jet a jab at one of the regional centres. Mr Hancock said the Government was on course to reach its target, running at over , people being vaccinated in England every day, and having already vaccinated around one third of the over-s in the country. He said all adults are expected to be offered an injection by the autumn. Mr Hancock told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: I hope that we will be able to handle thisin the future through a vaccination programme in the same way that we do flu each year.I think itaposs highly likely that there will be a dual vaccination programme for the foreseeable - this is in the medium-term - of flu and Covid. Professor Peter Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said it might be that people would have to get a coronavirus vaccine every few yearsit does need to be updated against new iants and depending on how long immunity lasts. He said the information to date on the success of vaccines against new iants is very encouraging, but warned the virus will not go away.He told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: This oneI think will not go away. Weaposre going to have to live with it but that may change signicantly. It may well become more of an endemic virus, thataposs with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths, but is not causing the huge disruption that weaposre seeing now. He said even after the elderly - who due to their age are more vulnerable to serious effects from Covid- - are vaccinated, the virus will have to be managed with social distancing measures as well as vaccination for the coming months.  Questions still need to be answered about how much protection coronavirus vaccines will afford the public, said Professor Devi Sridhar. The chair of public health at Edinburgh University said it was not yet clear how long immunity lasts,the vaccines stop people from being infectious or how much of the population would need to be covered to provide herd immunity. She told Times Radio: For me, the vaccine is definitely there, we have to continue roll-out, keep saving lives through protecting vulnerable people with that.

But with the nation plunged into its third lockdown she instead spent a ‘quiet birthday’ with a tea party organised by Prince William and children George, seven, Charlotte, five, and two-year-old Louis, it has been claimed. Other members of the royal family ensured her birthday was not forgotten with The Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall all send their wishes through social media. The official Royal Family account posted two images of Kate with the caption: Wishing the Duchess of Cambridge a very happy birthday today! – with the hashtag #HappyBirthdayHRH. Kate is showing the Queen the garden she helped design at the RHS Cha Flower Show in  in one image and the other shows her at a Scouts woggle last autumn where she meet Cub and Beaver Scouts in Northolt, West London. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall paid tribute to Kate with a photo of the mum-of-three meeting parents who were helped by peer support networks in the pandemic last year.

Deirdre Holmes, , from Northern Ireland, discovered the message one morning when she went to make her  am coffee.Terried by the risk of the coronavirus pandemic, Nicholas, , opened up about his fears of going to school in a letter, which broke mum Deirdreaposs heart, reports Belfast Live.The note, written in felt tip pen on kitchen paper, said: I don’t want to go to school. I don’t feel safe there right now!!!!! Plaes Mum. I don’t feel safe. Deirdre said: It was six o’clock in the morning and I was standing there in tears. Nicholas loves school and wouldn’t miss a day under any other circumstances. But the fear of Covid has been overwhelming for him and it has all got too much. We’ve been dealing with it as well as we could at home, not making a big deal of it, keeping the news off the TV and radio and just getting on. He was getting counselling to try to keep on top of his fears and he was still going to school. He wore his mask on the school bus from Strangford to Hillsborough every day and he was managing. But this week it all got too much for him and he needed me to do something to help him. He says he doesnapost want to get sick and he doesnapost want to die. And this virus is invisible so itaposs hard to know where it is and how to avoid it. Nicholas is good at maths and is very creative but he’s not very talkative and handwriting is not his strength. So when I saw the note he’d left and the effort he’d made to write it, I knew there was something very wrong. He’d written just  words and every one of them was an effort for him and as his mum, I felt they were very powerful.  He knew that the first thing I did every morning was make myself a cup of coffee and he knew the first thing I’d see was his message. I don’t know when he wrote it or left it by the kettle, but it was there on Tuesday morning waiting for me. Covid- has been a terrible experience for everyone and I was very worried about sending Nicholas to school. He goes to Beechlawn School in Hillsborough which caters for pupils with additional educational needs including Autism. Nicholas loves it and feels safe there and talks to his teacher about everything. So for him to beg not to go to school was a real wake up call. We had sat down to watch Boris Johnson’s address to the nation on Monday night and that was all Nicholas needed to hear. On Tuesday I woke up to his note.

With the nation in lockdown, Brits have been told to stay at home until at least mid-February, although itaposs believed lockdown measures are most likely to remain in place until late March. Pubs are likely to be one of the last businesses to reopen, with government ministers apparently looking at the first bank holiday in May as a possible reopening date.A source told  The Sunday Times : “The May Day bank holiday is more likely the moment you see pubs reopening.” It comes after takeaway pints were banned last week as part of lockdown measures introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Alcohol orders can no longer be placed for delivery or takeaway from pubs and restaurants, which was allowed in the previous lockdown. Itaposs another devastating blow to the hospitality industry, and will likely result in further businesses unable to stay afloat.With coronavirus cases continuing to increase in most parts of the country, lockdown rules being strengthened has not been ruled out.A toughening of measures could mean curfews, nurseries being closed, support bubbles being banned, face masks being made compulsory in all busy outdoor areas and exercise limited to one hour. Pub group Marston’s chief executive Ralph Findlay said the government must step up and extend the business rates holiday beyond its current end date in April, and cut VAT when doors finally open again. “The pub sector has been closed for much of the last nine months and remains in a very dficult position,” he said. “Regrettably there have been casualties across the sector and it is vital that the government reviews urgently the opportunity to continue to support pubs as we reopen the economy in the coming weeks. “Pubs are viable businesses which are part of the social fabric of Britain and which make a major contribution to the economy and the communities in which they serve. “It is vital that they not only survive the short-term crisis but are supported in order to recover and flourish. “Extending the business rates holiday and VAT cut for the rest of this year is a minimum requirement.” Earlier this week the Campaign for Real Alesaid the ban on takeaway pints during lockdown could be the “death knell for many pubs”. Camra chairman Nik Antona said the Chancellor’s one-off grant support of up to £, for hospitality businesses was “welcome” but added: “It is nowhere near enough to cover the haemorrhaging costs for pubs and breweries.” “The national lockdown is yet another devastating blow for an already struggling industry, which follows hot on the heels of nearly a year of restrictions, curfews and forced closures, Mr Antona added.  “It is clear now more than ever that the Government must introduce a new, long-term and sector-specic financial support package to help these businesses survive the coming months. “While one-off grant support is welcome, it is nowhere near enough to cover the haemorrhaging costs for pubs and breweries that don’t see any end in sight.” Also responding to the latest lockdown restrictions and financial support, Society of Independent Brewerschief executive James Calder said: “This is simply the next blow after months of struggle for England’s community pubs and small breweries.

The monarch broke with protocol to announce on Saturday she had been given her first injection, alongside husband Prince Philip, from a royal doctor at Windsor Castle.The head of state made the personal decision to let it be known she had accepted the vaccine to send a “message of hope” to the country, as Britain reaches a crisis point in the battle against coronavirus.Royal sources confirmed the Queen will not go public when she is given her follow up inoculation in order to squash speculation into which vaccine she received. Buckingham Palace has not confirmed whether the royal couple were given the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the first to be approved by the UKaposs medicines regulator in early December, or the British-made Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which was rolled out last week. Speculation has continued as to whether the royals waited until the British made vaccination was ready, in an apparent show of support to our scientists at home. On December , the four UK chief medical officers announced the second doses of the covid vaccines should be given towards the end of  weeks, rather than in the previously recommended - weeks. The controversial statement which has been criticised by some medical experts, was to ensure the prioritisation process “will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services,” they said.  Pfizer and BioNTech have both said their vaccine was tested based on two doses three weeks apart and that they have no data to support erging from that timeline. Data from the Oxford AstraZeneca trials supports the new plan. It showed that antibody levels were nearly three times higher in participants who had waited  weeks between doses, compared with those where the gap had been under  weeks. To squash further speculation the Queen agreed with her advisors to stay silent on the timing of her second jab A royal source said: “The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh received their Covid- vaccinations when they were made available to them on the NHS.

This way theyaposll be able to match the stickers up and put their shoes on by themselves, giving you a couple of extra minutes to get yourself sorted. Hack number two is for when your kids get too big to carry or to hold.

Sheaposs worn it for work, while out walking, to chill out on the sofa and even on Christmas Day. In fact, the -year-old has worn the Rowena dress, which is made from sustainably sourced merino wool, for  days in a row. The church Leader and college chaplain Sarah Robbins-Cole joked that sheaposs taking her job very literally, becoming a lady of the cloth. Sarah, who lives in Boston, USA, joined the  Day Dress Challenge on September ,  in a bid to live without fast fashion and help save the planet. She enjoyed it so much that sheaposs set herself a new challenge for . “To my surprise, wearing the same dress for  days in a row didn’t take anything away from my le. “Instead, it’s inspired me to go one step further and not to buy any new clothes or accessories between January , , and January , . “I realised that, at my age, I have clothes for every occasion andI need a ballgown, I’ll dust one off that’s been in my wardrobe since !“I am thinking of clearing my wardrobe and having a big declutter, but I’ll wait and see what I do wear over this coming year first.”Sarah has three children with her British husband, clergyman Adrian - Elizabeth and Will - and the family have two rescue dogs. She was among about  women who took up the -day challenge, run by clothing brand Wool.  Designed to show participants how wearing just one garment every day would change their spending habits, reduce their laundry load and, by not buying fast fashion, help them to save the planet, it also changed the way Sarah felt about how she looks and dresses. “I first saw the challenge on social media and thought why not ” said Sarah. “So, I really was a lady of the cloth!” Participants were allowed to wash and dry the dress overnight, butthey were awake, they were expected to wear it. And anyone who completed the challenge would win a , which is £, voucher to spend on a new Wool dress.  Teaming her long-sleeved, scoop-neck, knee- Rowena dress, made from sustainably sourced merino wool, with a dog collar when she was working and even tucking it into jeans for an outdoor hike, she then documented the challenge by posting all her  dferent looks on her Instagram page @thisdressagain.Sarah, who has just started a sabbatical and is in the midst of a doctoral programme in educational leadership, says not only did her repetitive wardrobe simply her le, it also taught her about something she calls “spotlighting.” “Spotlighting is that feeling that everyone is looking at you when in reality, they’re probably not,” she said. “Wearing the same dress for so long helped me avoid that feeling.”  The only really dficult part of the whole challenge, according to Sarah, was having to post a new look every day on social media. She said: “I forewarned my college students that I would be taking the challenge because they’d be seeing me in the same dress every day, which they might find odd. “But, more importantly, I told them not to think when they looked at the pictures I posted that they were a true reflection of my le and that I was always that tidy and well put together. “It was important to me for them to know that. “I remember one student telling me how she could come out of a lecture feeling happy, check her phone, see what looked like someone ’s picture-perfect le and feel depressed by the time she had crossed the campus to her next lecture.  “By taking on this challenge, I had an insight into the unbelievable pressure that comes with social media.” She was equally surprised by the number of random followers she attracted – including some very handsome men – who found their way to her Instagram pages – who she feared were not who they said they were. She also received some intimate and inappropriate comments from strangers, who she ended up blocking. But, overall, she had a very insightful and worthwhile experience, saying: “The dress was comfortable, easy to wear and completely unremarkable.  “I enjoyed accessorising it and, although I missed wearing jeans and found the long sleeves a bit warm when the sun came out, I didn’t really miss anything from my normal wardrobe. “It was so easy to get up and get dressed in the same thing. It saved me loads of time and it was simple to brighten it up using accessories. “The challenge did make me think about how many clothes end up in landfill, how much water is used to produce cotton and how we don’t really know whether the clothes we buy are made ethically, too.” Most importantly, the challenge helped Sarah to connect on a deeper level with what really matters in le.

In North East Syria the largely Kurdish statelet of Rojava had briefly carved out a semi-autonomous peace after western-backed forces drove out Islamic State.But spitefully in , the now disgraced and outgoing US President Donald Trump forced the Kurds to turn to Russia and the feared Syrian regime for protection from Turkish invaders.His sudden withdrawal of US troops from north east Syria green-lit Turkish forces to roll over the border, forcing Kurds to accept help. Turkey displaced hundreds of thousands of Syrians, killed hundreds and now the region fears a further incursion as Turkey seeks to buffer its territory against the Syrian Democratic Forces.  The Trump-led betrayal after the SDF had fought so hard against ISIS on behalf of the west smashed years of campaigning to put this region on the road to recovery. Now, a further push by Turkey could threaten this struggling community, which is desperate for help from the retreating west. And as the World awaits how global tensions will change under the new Biden administration few communities are more concerned than in the town of Qamshili, the main hub in Rojava, to which the west, Britain more than many, owes a huge debt. Kurdish and western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces ended Islamic Stateaposs stranglehold on the region, ousting them from Raqqa, which had become “terror central” and from where many European attacks were plotted. They all hope the US will now re-plug the security gap here and urgently undo the damage done by Trumpaposs cruel move, by reasserting western presence here. All those years of British and US troops training the SDF who are still courageously battling Islamic State sleepers are now largely undone thanks to Trump. His move has allowed ISIS to resurge amid further fears Turkey will further overrun much of Rojava, swallowing up Qamshili. But years of bloody conflict and the worldaposs most evil terror network have taught locals a resilience that defies nine years of brutal violence. The bustling alleyways and bazaars of Qamshili are bursting with shoppers and traders desperately trying to survive. But covert enemies are everywhere. Sleeper cells from Islamic State, the Assad regime and Turkey have turned many communities into cities of spies. We are told at night local Syrian Democratic Forces smash down doors and raid the cells, seizing or killing the undercover threat. In the past week resurging Islamic State fighters have in Syria emerged from the shadows and murdered as many as  people, including soldiers and civilians. But when we meet locals in Rojavaaposs main city, close to the Turkish border, they are out shopping and trading, socialising in cafes, awaiting the next onslaught. Everything is on sale in the bazaar, imitation sportswear, shoes, clothes, spices, bread – even antique artefacts several thousand years old. Men smoke and play cards solemnly, families shop for food as security men finger AK rles eyeing us as we try to chat to locals, waving us on, irritated by our presence. Driving into Qamshili we pass a large Russian military troop convoy. In the far distance a Russian Alligator attack helicopter is flying in support of an MI chopper troop carrier. Our driver carefully picks a route bypassing Assad regime checkpoints, muttering thatwe are caught our feet might not touch the ground until we reach a Damascus jail. A Westerner being lted from these streets by Assadaposs troops or intelligence agencies would be scooped up and whisked to a Damascus jail, possibly never to be seen again. One American war tourist last year took a wrong turn here and suffered months of torture in Assadaposs prisons before being released. Reaching the main bazaar we talk to locals.  Two busloads of Assad regime military intelligence officers drive past, eying shoppers from behind curtained windows a smartly-dressed barber summed it all up, as we duck into an alleyway. Shop owner Mohammed Mirzah, , says: “The threat to here is simple – first it comes from Turkey, then Islamic State and then the regime. All of us are very nervous of what will happen next. “There are so many flags here it is terrying- Russian troops, Syrian regime and Islamic State of course is never far away from us, even though they were supposed to be beaten. “We just want to get on with our lives.” Most of Mohammedaposs nine children have fled for Europe, leaving him with just his youngest, Alan, who is  to help with the struggling hair-dresser business. The tension here is palpable. Islamic State car bombs blew up these streets just a year ago, killing and injuring many, their craters and blasted walls still on display.  Some locals are horribly injured, bearing the scars of war, hands, arms, legs missing, faces horribly scarred. One crippled man painfully negotiates the traffic, pushing his wheelchair backwards. People ignore him in collective denial about this communityaposs grim recent past and uncertain future. Khaled Sheikhmuss, , a kiddiesapos toy shop owner says: “We are desperate as the economy is bad and the security situation is not good either, as you can see. “Nobody knows for sure what will happen to us next. We have to keep surviving.” The almost overt presence of many nationaposs intelligence agencies all vying for leverage here makes Qamshili similar to a post World War Two Vienna, an international hub for spies. We learn that we can no longer visit a mixed grill restaurant that was popular with journalists last year as it is too full of intelligence officers lying to each other, swapping information and trading back-channelled threats, desperately seeking leverage. Now the venueaposs customers are from the Turkish MIT intelligence agency. Russiaaposs feared military intelligence wing the GRU, who launched the Salisbury Novichok attack and Assadaposs army spooks. Added to the mix are local mafia bosses who are also trying to get in on the turf war and underhand carve-up of the region. In Qamshili Rojavaaposs Foreign Minister Dr Abdulkarim Omaraposs office is within site of the Turkish border. He is desperately worried about the future for Rojavaaposs five million strong population and stresses that Turkey used Islamic State and other jihadi groups as proxies to hit Rojavaaposs mostly Kurdish forces. Blaming Britain and America – whose special forces troops have largely withdrawn south away from the Turkish border as a result of Trumpaposs decision, - he tells us: “This is entirely the fault of the coalition and Trumpaposs decision, which he announced on twitter.

Once again, our lives have been dramatically altered.When we first went into lockdown, last March, few of us could have imagined that  months on we would be facing the same restrictions again.For tens of thousands of Scottish businesses, these developments are potentially crippling.Pubs, restaurants, hotels, non-essential shops and gyms, along with many others, have been forced to close their doors again.Those businesses have collectively spent millions of pounds and devoted countless hours making their premises Covid-secure in order to protect their staff and customers.The speed at which restrictions have been reintroduced will have meant that stock will have gone to waste and orders cancelled at the last minute. Those businesses also have no guarantee of when they will be able to reopen.Many of those affected by the restrictions are not big chains but locally-owned employers that were just managing to get by when the pandemic began.Now they have endured numerous cycles of opening and closing over the last  months and burned through whatever savings they may have had.It is more important than ever that both of Scotland’s governments are doing everything they can to support Scottish businesses.The UK Government has already taken unprecedented action by protecting almost one million Scottish jobs through the furlough scheme.It has also supported , Scottish businesses with Bounce Back Loans and delivered £. billion to the Scottish government to manage the pandemic.Yet, in the words of the Federation of Small Businesses, support from the SNP government in Edinburgh has been “a dollar short and a day late”.Their own statistics show that more than , businesses are still waiting for their application to the business support fund to be processed, even though that fund closed in July.We are proposing a -working day national standard for new business applications to be processed and councils given the right support to clear the application backlog.#Douglas RossAlso, £ of every £ set aside to support businesses over the October ‘circuit breaker’ has not been paid out.The SNP have also announced support for ious groups like wedding suppliers and taxi drivers at the start of December, yet we are now into  and those businesses still cannot apply for that funding.That is why the Scottish Conservatives are calling on the SNP to take urgent action to improve the business grants system.We are proposing a -working-day national standard for new business applications to be processed and councils given the right support to clear the application backlog.This will ensure that businesses have the certainty of when they can expect a decision on their grant application and, most importantly, can access funding sooner.We are also calling for an end to the press-release-first-and-guidance-second approach that the SNP has taken on business funding.They should have applications open as soon as an announcement is made so that businesses are not waiting weeks for vital support.In addition, we are challenging the SNP to match the UK’s commitment to pay up to £, as a one-off grant to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England this month.Nicola Sturgeon’s government is sitting on more than £ million from the UK Government. Get this money spent.Given how dficult this winter is, this money should be used to support struggling shops, pubs and hotels now, not hoarded away for another day.Finally, we urge the SNP to give retail, hospitality and leisure businesses certainty that they will not face full business rates in the next financial year.We need  per cent tax relief carried into   so that we are properly supporting those businesses to recover from the pandemic. We will be campaigning for this to be delivered in the Scottish budget.With the vaccination rollout, we are all hopeful that we will see ato normality in the coming months. Yet,we do not properly support businesses across Scotland now, then we may find that many local employers remain shut even as the rest of our country reopens.Scottish businesses need cash in their accounts now, not more promises in SNP press releases.

Incoming were Jordon Forster, for his first start since October, and Fin Robertson.Also missing were housemates Cammy Kerr and Declan McDaid after the news of a positive Covid- test at the club yesterday. That saw Ashcroft step into the right-back role.Bonnyrigg, meanwhile, had a former Deefiant Dee skippering them with Jonny Stewart ing to his former club.The home side had an early opportunity for Sow blocked but it was the underdogs who created the big chance early on.The ball was dropped in behind the home defence and George Hunter raced onto the ball, firing towards the corner but he was denied by a superb stop from Dundee goalie Jack Hamilton.The Lowland League side continued to look the more dangerous in attack and made that count after  minutes as the referee pointed to the spot, much to the dismay of the Dark Blues.Forster was the man penalised for bringing down Dean Hoskins in the area, giving Lee Currie # who scored a hat-trick of penalties in the first round # the chance from  yards which he took with aplomb.Finally Dundee tested Rose keeper Weir five minutes before the break as Charlie Adam smashed a fierce drive goalwards but saw his effort beaten out.The Dark Blues upped their game immediately after the restart with Mullen bringing a good low save out of Weir. That was to be the story for much of the second period.Bonnyrigg were camped in their own half but continued to hold firm with Sow next to miss a decent chance, heading over from six yards on  minutes.With  minutes to go Sow tested Weir from  yards before the Rose No  kept out a close-range Paul McGowan header.With  to go the crossbar came to Rose#s rescue as Neil Martynuik skewed a clearance towards his own goal only to be relieved as the ball cannoned back off the woodwork.In stoppage time Weir pulled off a top-class save to keep out a goal-bound Ashcroft header before Liam Fontaine saw another header cleared off the line as it looked like the home side were heading out.Finally the pressure told with  minutes on the clock, however, as Weir pulled off yet another wonder save to keep out a Sow header before substitute Afolabi forced the ball over the line.The visitors showed more ambition in extra time and almost re-took the lead as Kerr Young saw a header cleared off the line by Adam.They did remarkably go back in front seconds before the break through another debatable penalty as Ross Gray hit the deck under Jordan Marshall#s challenge.Once more Currie stepped up and made no mistake from  yards.Dundee didn#t wait too long to level things up this time with Ashcroft rising highest from an Adam corner to nod in for - with  minutes on the clock.And they took the lead for the first time in the game with nine minutes to go as Sow followed up yet another Weir save, this time from Mullen, to knock into an empty net.The Dark Blues should have wrapped up victory with three minutes remaining but Afolabi put a Marshall cross wide from yards out.After that the referee brought an end to a pulsating cup tie that saw Dundee relieved to get through after denying Bonnyrigg a famous victory by the skin of their teeth.Dundee: J Hamilton, Ashcroft, Fontaine, Forster, Marshall, Byrne , Robertson , Adam, McGowan, Mullen , Sow.Subs not used: Ferrie, N Hamilton, D Strachan, Murray.Bonnyrigg Rose: Weir, Brett, Young, Horne, Martynuik, Hoskins, Stewart , Currie, S Gray , Hunter , McGachie.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

In the years which followed, that death toll rose by thousands as people succumbed to radiation sickness.Among those who died was Sadako Sasaki, a pupil at Hiroshima’s Noboricho Elementary School, who developed acute leukaemia  years after being exposed to the radiation.While she was in hospital, she was inspired by the Japanese tradition that suggestssomeone makes a thousand origami cranes, their wish will come true. Sadako’s final days were spent folding paper cranes # hoping she would recover.After her death, her friends swore to build a monument in her honour, and their efforts led to the Children’s Peace Monument. Today, children around the world send more than  tonnes of paper cranes to the monument – more than the combined weight of Little Boy and Fat Man .The paper cranes are recycled by Peace Minds Hiroshima and sent to children around the world with Sadako’s story, raising awareness of the need for peace and nuclear abolition.Blessing the crane sculpture, Fr Ronald quoted from Pope Francis# World Day of Peace statement: #How many resources are spent on weaponry, especially nuclear weapons, that could be used for more signicant priorities such as ensuring the safety of iniduals, the promotion of peace and integral human development, the fight against poverty, and the provision of health care.#Global problems like the present Covid- pandemic and climate change have only made these challenges all the more evident. What a courageous decision it would be to establish a #Global Fund# with the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, in order to permanently eliminate hunger and contribute to the development of the poorest countries.#Fr Ronald added: #On January , the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force. This is a milestone on the road to peace.#The crane was gted to St Margaret’s peace garden by Pax Christi Scotland chairwoman Marian Pallister and crafted by Lochgilphead blacksmith Jack Campbell to remind us to continue to strive for peace, and as Pope Francis reminds us, #…to esteem the value and dignity of every person, to act together in solidarity for the common good, and to bring relief to those suffering from poverty, disease, slavery, armed conflicts, and discrimination#.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a creative blast from scotlands past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected

temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are

This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Searching for innovative ways to reconnect with audiences at home and abroad TWTC’s creative director Sadie Dixon-Spain created the ‘Clanagram’, creating paid employment for actors, and producing virtual keepsakes for audiences.Clanagrams are personalised video greetings, sending friends and family near and far love and good cheer, as TWTC’s team of professional actors bring to le a selection of Scotland’s great names.An ideal gt for those with Scottish heritage, Scots in exile, or simply lovers of all things Scottish – it is a unique message from a Scottish hero, sent to them directly to celebrate a special occasion, or simply just to make them smile.Visit www.clanagram to become a member of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army and receive a message from the Young Pretender himself, a recitation of poetry by the national bard, or a tale from Scotland’s most famous outlaw, Rob Roy.The arts have suffered immensely due to the Covid- pandemic, while tight restrictions continue to press pause on the live events industry. With the creation of digital performances and offerings such as Clanagrams, TWTC aims to continue finding innovative ways of performing, bringing theatre back to audiences, and offering creative professionals employment once again.WEST KINTYRE:Nothing blows away the cobwebs like a walk along Westport Beach on Kintyre#s west coast.The beach, the longest in mainland Argyll, is one of the jewels in Kintyre#s crown and usually draws surfers and tourists from near and far all year round.At the moment, however, under the strict new lockdown measures which limit travel, it is much quieter than usual and is frequented mainly by walkers, runners and dog-walkers living nearby.This photograph, taken by Mid Argyll-based amateur photographer Aileen Gillies in December, shows not only the beach#s rugged coastline but also its wild beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Local beat group, the Sloe-Gin, will play at the dance without charge on Friday, January .Mr McKinley hopes to have the raffle on the way by the beginning of next week.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONew Year holiday attractionsThe entertainments arranged in town for the New Year holidays present attractions of an ample and ied description.Out of doors football holds the field, a series of interesting games have been arranged for both for New Year#s Day and the following Monday.The evenings can be pleasantly filled by a series of entertainments of great promise, while an exceptionally large exhibition of poultry, pigeons, cage birds and rabbits has been organised by the Campbeltown Ornithological Society.The local Picture House management have made very complete arrangements for the crowds who are sure to include in the holiday rounds a visit to ‘the pictures’.During Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, continuous shows will be given from  o#clock in the afternoon, doors opening at ..The principal picture for Saturday is entitled ‘In the Hollow of Her Hand’ and it will be supplemented by a number of other interesting films both topical and humorous.A change of picture will be made on Monday and again on Tuesday when the principal films will be ‘The Judgement of the Desert’ and ‘The Merry-Go-Round’ respectively.The latter will be continued on Wednesday, and will be followed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a striking film entitled ‘The Snares of Paris’.This ied programme will be welcomed by patrons and should result in sustained interest in shows at the Picture House during the holiday period.On New Year’s night, a concert will be given in the Victoria Hall under the auspices of the local branch of the Comrades of the Great War.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied. His father looked and shook his head.ldquoThey are just bushes and trees, swaying in the breeze, explained his father angrily. ldquoYou have called us up here for nothing. Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended.

painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the grounds of the Priory, my own house in Dunbar.No ancient ruins ever existed in these parts, as far as can be discerned: a postcard from Edwardian times, stamped and posted before work on the Priory was begun in , merely shows farmland and market gardens.Maybe the friars had their garden here, growing fruit and medicinal plants Another speculation is that one of the walls of Friarrsquos Walk represents a substantial fragment of the post-medieval western town wall.Since at least the western wall of Friarrsquos Walk has several blocked doorways, a rationalist would instead suspect that it was intended as a rear lane to the houses on High Street, used for the removal of rubbish and garden waste.The mystery of Friarrsquos Walk is a profound one, and unlikely ever to be solved."},{"url":null,"title":"january-7-coronavirus-figures-update-east-lothian-sixth-lowest-scotland","story":"The most recent data from Public Health Scotland shows that between December  and

NBCC is run completely by volunteers, many of whom also have full-time jobs.ldquoWe had y discussions with ELC last time round and provided them a report on all we had done.ldquoWe hope thatresilience is required again, there will be far more support and our level of involvement will be lessened.

They were a leline to many.\"During this current temporary lockdown, the council has decided that at the moment, it is not necessary to reinstate these groups.\"The current advice is for those on the shielding list to work from home where possible and, where not possible, to stay away from the workplace. They are not being asked to undertake full shielding again, but to pay particular attention to national advice on avoiding infection.\"For that reason, and the fact there is more support available now than in March last year, for example access to priority supermarket delivery slots and support grants for self-isolation, we are not asking resilience groups to operate again.\"We will continue to monitor the situation and,there is an increase in demand for support, we will respond to that in the most appropriate way.\"We will also be issuing a reminder of the support available via our website, social media channels, our local media partners and via community councils."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-say-proposed-crematorium-old-craighall","story":"Westerleigh Group wants to build the facility off the A, on the opposite side of the carriageway from the Musselburgh Service Area, close to the junction of the A with the City of Edinburgh Bypass at Old Craighall.The -acre site ndash sandwiched between the eastbound carriageway of the Bypass and westbound carriageway of the A ndash would include a chapel, parking and a landscaped garden of remembrance.

The latter term was coined by the environmental campaigner Chris Packham.ldquoThe people I call ultra-vegans just want to stop all meat consumption overnight. But that would be no good for meat farmers. It would be no good for our landscapes, where low-intensity, good-quality animal husbandry and livestock farming are actually good for bioersity.So the language around Veganuary is softening somewhat. An open letter, organised by the Veganuary Association and signed by celebs, such as Alan Cumming and Paul McCartney, states: ldquoWe cannot tackle climate change while we farm and eat animals on an industrial scale.This is a sht from more heated rhetoric in previous years that condemned all livestock production indiscriminately, ascrofter-reared Shetland lamb was no dferent from fast food beef from a dusty US feedlot.SoI get into discussion with someone contemplating becoming vegan, Irsquoll be asking them to mull over these thoughts before adopting this extreme approach.Irsquod first seethey have read The Vegetarian Myth, by the Canadian author Lierre Keith. She was a vegan for over  years, believing this diet would honour animals, feed the hungry, and save the planet. Now she believes veganism ldquois one part cult, one part eating disorder, and that it ldquodestroyed her body.She recounts how her fervent ideological determination blinded her to early warning signs, such as missed periods. She describes how she has been left with irreversible spine disease, gut problems, pain and more.She includes depression and anxiety in this tally, which thankfully alleviated substantially once she jumped off the vegan wagon.ldquoYou donrsquot have to try this for yourself. Yoursquore allowed to learn from my mistakes, she urges would-be vegan recruits.Over  startling pages Keith details the nutritional reasons why sustained veganism is no formula for human health. Even those who refuse to read it would be advised to skim it,only to learn what daily supplements they will need to prevent their bodies becoming gravely deficient in macro- and micro-nutrients that are essential for good health.Irsquod also ask provisional vegans to consider what food our land is best at producing. Scotland is world famous not for soya, corn, legumes, and other vegan staples, but for our cattle breeds, such as Aberdeen Angus for meat, and Ayrshire for milk.Why  They reflect our agricultural strengths, within natural biological and climactic limits. A vegan diet asks you to cold-shoulder the foods we farm most effortlessly, which seems daft.To those attracted to veganism because it is supposedly ldquodeath-free, Irsquod say think again.All agriculture involves bloody animal death, itrsquos just that when it comes to plant food, the casualties of the combine harvester and sprayer are smaller: voles, worms, field mice, birds, bees, the list goes on.Carry out a wildle audit of permanent grassland with grazing animals, and fields for crops, yoursquoll find that the former always tops the latter. And from where, without the biological le introduced into soil by livestock manures, would the fertility needed to grow solely plant foods come  Fertilisers made from fossil fuels, is the answer.My parting shot would be food quality. Acquaint yourself with the ingredients list of Oatly plain ldquoOatgurt, for instance, priced at pound. a kilo. The first ingredient is cheap water, then we drop down to oats at %, followed by potato starch, rapeseed oil, modied potato starch, oat fibre, potato protein, malic and lactic acids, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, synthetic vitamins, and potassium iodide.Thanks but no thanks. Irsquoll stick with real yoghurt made from the milk of real cows ndash or goats, or sheep, or buffalo.Forget Veganuary, Irsquom trying out Regenuary: basing my meals on the foods that are produced here, using regenerative farming methods that improve the environment, not trash it.Thatrsquos the truly progressive food goal for thinking omnivores.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

But dont worry, there are plenty of old favourites around too, including those played by Ricky Whittle, Emily Browning and Ian McShane.The Silence Moving and disturbing four-part drama, originally shown on BBC One in , follows the story of -year-old Amelia Edwards, who has recently been fitted with a cochlear implant. Desperate to escape from her over-protective parents, Amelia goes to stay with her Aunt Maggie, homicide detective uncle Jim, and teenage, free-spirited cousins Tom, Sophie and Joel. While there she witnesses the murder of a policewoman, a case Jim is eventually assigned to - although he initially doesnt realise his niece may have the information he needs to catch the culprit, and when he does, it becomes clear that Amelias knowledge could put her le at risk. Genevieve Barr, Douglas Henshall, Dervla Kirwan, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee head the cast.Finding Joy Its been described as Catastrophe meets Fleabag, which is a heady mix indeed, but theres certainly a taste of both of them in Amy Hubermans le-affirming comedy drama - as well as a heap of originality its also a lot more fun than the latter. If you havent caught the first series yet, make sure you stream that before making a date with the second run. For the initiated, Hubermanplays a newly single woman who, after splitting with her long-term love, gets a big break at work when shes asked to fill in for Irelands favourite blogger. The second run sees her embrace the new Joy, or Joy ., as she puts it. Unfortunately, she hasnt quite got everything she needs for success under control.Miranda Its been a while since Miranda Harts series aired on regular TV and, despite rumours of a revival every now and then, new episodes have so far failed to arrive. Thankfully, then, every episode is now being made available to stream - thats all three series of the sitcom, plus the two-part special finale. Hart takes the lead role of Miranda, a former public school girl who is socially inept and finds it dficult to fit in with members of her peer group - in particular Tilly, who was her childhood nemesis. Miranda also struggles to connect with members of the opposite sex, in particular her hunky former university pal Gary. Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, Sarah Hadland and Sally Phillips co-star.Outside the Wire It may sound like a spin-off from David Simons superlative Baltimore-set crime drama The Wire, but this science fiction epic couldnt be further from it. Directed by acclaimed Swedish film-maker Mikael Hafstrom, whose  movie Evil received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, its set in the future and stars Damson Idris as Leo, a drone pilot sent into a dangerous demilitarised zone. Hes assigned to work for a android officer Harp , whose job it is to locate a doomsday device before enemy agents can get their hands on it. Emily Beecham, Michael Kelly and Pilou Asbaek are among the supporting cast.Servant When it comes to creating thrillers with a spooky edge, few do it better than M Night Shyamalan. The man who brought the world the blockbusting The Sixth Sense ventured onto the small screen in  his Apple TV+ series became one of the streaming services first major hits. It focuses on Dorothy and Sean who, following the death of their baby son, hire nanny Leanne to take care of the reborn doll theyre raising in his place. But Leanne couldnt be further removed from Mary Poppins, and soon, bizarre and terrying events begin to occur... Lauren Ambrose, Toby Kebbel, Nell Tiger Free and Rupert Grintto the cast, and although Shyamalan is keeping mum about the new runs premise, he promises it will be just as disturbing as its predecessor."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12207432.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hamilton-mausoleum-echoes-egyptian-sarcophagus","story":"Before the motorway ever existed, the distinctive building ndash within the grounds of the former Hamilton Palace ndash was a Lanarkshire landmark, holding a world record for the longest echo recorded within a man-made structure .Built as a tomb and monument to Alexander, th Duke of Hamilton during the mid-th century, its design is testament to his zest for history, travel and fine art.Hamilton was appointed British ambassador to Russia, based in St Petersburg, in .

Do we ordinarily need to convey esteem, courtesy, or respect in this day and age Irsquom not so sure about esteem, but the latter two qualities seem to be sorely lacking in public discourse. At The Herald, we like the tone of civility they imply.

I know the sort of changes I wish to see in society and Irsquom not actually bothered about where they come from ndash Scotland, UK or Europe. . The UK seems destined to be governed by the Tories for some considerable time, so it seems to me that the quickest way of moving towards the society I want to see is supporting Scottish independence.

This is absolutely untrue andMr Macwhirter would take off his rose-tinted, nationalist-framed specs, he would realise the silent majority of pro-Union supporters is mighty and stirring.It is a sad state of affairs that the majority of Scottish journalists are pro-indy, pro-destruction of the United Kingdom and do not have the spine to bring Nicola Sturgeon to account for every shortcoming of her independence first-and-only cause.

The overriding purpose is perpetuation of the system itself, not to meaningfully change it, certainly not to improve it, definitely not to accommodate bigger membership of it so that more can enjoy its top-end benefits.So in the US, a swap-about happens between two parties, Democrat and Republican, their policies over the years switching about but without affecting matters important in the daily lives of the big majority of people ndash for instance racial discrimination, handgun availability, lack of welfare and health provision and general denunciation of public service institutions.The UK similarly integrates political parties that during election periods espouse dferent policies from each other, but when governments are in place these dferent policies become dissolvable, of multi-party substance and therefore expressive of the political power system rather than of matters important in the lives of the majority of the population. As in the US, the electorate, bizarrely in effect, votes itself into a power system that excludes it.That, as far as I am concerned, reflects on the whole Westminster Brexit issue. A main opposition party that props up a power structure in preference to the electorate, and can somehow fit membership of the House of Lords with the mundane, often austere, lives of those who vote them into their ermine retirement.No, Scotland wasnt party to this, nor will the majority of its population be partying in celebration of it any time soon.

The reality is that prohibition hasnrsquot worked and never will.Inevitably some of the fatalities ascribed to the consumption of illegal drugs are avoidable and are a matter of quality control and adulteration by unexpected additives such as Fentanyl. Many believe the use of mind-altering drugs by some iniduals to be their escape-hatch from a reality that none of us would want to experience. The stigma of drug addiction also seems only to be applied to ldquojunkies from the lowest social stratum while the hordes of middle and upper-class regular users of cannabis, cocaine and ldquoparty drugs escape that epithet.Nobody ever stops to ask why these drugs are classed illegal when almost all of them have been or currently are being used for therapeutic reasons by the medical profession. Other than some of the newer synthetic agents most are routinely prescribed by your local chemist in accurate amounts of known potency why does Joe Public need a prescription from a third party to obtain them  Why can a heroin addict be given methadone on prescription but cannot buy from the same pharmacy the heroin he she really wants  Who has the right to tell an inidual what they can or cannot do to themselves Thankfully many countries have decriminalised the use of drugs such as cannabis one can only hope that in the fullness of time the elderly matrons of Morningside and Milngavie having an attack of the vapours will be able to, as their Victorian ancestors could, take a swig from their Laudanum bottle without PC Plod banging on the door.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.DOES POWER OF PRIVILEGE ENDURE EQUALITY before the law is a fundamental principle of our legal system and enshrined in Article  of The Universal Declaration Of Human Rights.That is why it is reaffirming to learn that Margaret Ferrier MP has been a charged with \"culpable and reckless conduct\" by acting, allegedly, in breach of Covid regulations.Against this backdrop, I await the Crown Office revisiting the following cases.That would confirm even-handedness and refute the fear Police Scotland have been leaned on, months after the event.In March Prince Charles, who later tested positive with Covid, came up to Balmoral with Camilla, Duchess Of Cornwall, and their staff, in wilful breach of Covid regulations.This flouting of the rules was dangerous and caused fury as frontline NHS staff had yet to receive the Covid test, Aberdeenshire NHS had to rush to them to administer.In April Catherine Calderwood could not resist two trips to her second home in sunny Fe, having lectured the rest of us on social distancing.In May Dominic Cummings drove to Barnard Castle, having demanded we stay in our primary residence and not travel.Professor Neil Ferguson advised lockdown for the UK but, by May, ignored his travel ban to meet his married lover.What these cases have in common is that they involved intelligent, arrogant people who were fully aware of the Covid regulations, but had such a feeling of entitlement, they, clearly, felt these did not apply to them.Were these not reckless and culpable conduct  Are we witnessing the enduring power of privilege John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.CAN OUR HIGH STREETS SURVIVE YET again we are plunged into another lockdown.

Well, I can easily reel off the names of  respected scientists who reject this theory.Consensus is for politics, not science. A bunch of scientists cannot just vote on something being true.There was a consensus that the earth was flat until Magellans expedition proved otherwise in . There was a consensus on Newtonian Physics until Einstein came along. Alfred Wegeners  theory of plate tectonics was ridiculed, but after  years was finally accepted.The Climategate emails, where so-called climate scientists from around the world wrongly believed that they were communicating privately, have some interesting takes on this. For example, in an email dated September ,  Keith Brfa wrote: ldquoMy concern was motivated by the possibility of expressing an impression of more consensus than might actually exist, and in  John Christy wrote: ldquoThis gets to the issue that the consensus reports now are just the consensus of those who agree with the consensus.Geoff Moore, Alness."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12208894.jpg?type=article-full","title":"boost-farm-tours-staycations-helping-build-scottish-agritourism","story":"It is something not everyone gets to share, but is one of the success stories of how the farming community pulled together in lockdown with live video streams of the agricultural equivalent of TV show One Born Every Minute.Scotlandrsquos farm tourism, or agritourism as it is becoming known, had been proving popular for the past few years with farms offering day tours or holiday accommodation to help people discover the great outdoors.And when staycations came into their own last year with families wanting to holiday safely in the great outdoors, the sector saw a knock-on effect when tourism reopened in July. Families booked accommodation at sites in rural Scotland offering a safe and unique environment.However, it is hoped that the recent interest in exploring what is on your own doorstep and enjoying the green space around you is something that will continue beyond what has so far begun as a restricted .ldquoHours after the beginning of last yearrsquos March lockdown, businesses were forced to close and people faced uncertainty, but for us it was straight into lambing and-hour days with early starts, said Caroline Millar, one of the leading experts for Scottish Agritourism set up to represent the sector and help it to develop.ldquoI think those of us involved in agritourism really came together and while we couldnrsquot physically welcome people to the land we began live farm tours to offer people a virtual access to the countryside and it coincided with lambing, she added.ldquoWe had people viewing the videos from all over the country including further afield and brought a sense of community from rural locations from east to west or north to south. Some people might have tuned in to see what could go wrong and we did have one incident with a sheep trying to escape during a live link.ldquoFrom those videos it then sparked an interest from people wanting to holiday on farms or enjoy day tours. From shepherd huts to luxury lodges people were getting in touch and wanted a dferent experience.While there might now be a name for the sector, Mrs Millar, who represented the industry on the Scottish Governmentrsquos tourism recovery task force, said there is nothing new in the idea of agritourism.ldquoI grew up on a farm and my mum and granny were used to cooking for large numbers with local farm produce and we were also used to having a full house, Mrs Millar added. ldquoI suppose the agritourism of the s was the farm BBs and then we saw the growth of farm shops, food tours and festivals from the s and s. Now I think we have a sector where there is real potential for growth.ldquoIf someone can come and enjoy a day out, a farm trip with a walk in the hills nearby and then enjoy a cheese-tasting or steak-tasting opportunity at the end of it we are making it an attractive possibility.Mrs Millar was brought up on the family farm near Caputh, Perthshire and worked and lived in Australia and New Zealand before ing home. Now you will find her and her family running their own mixed arable farm, Balkello at Auchterhouse in Angus, which lies just two miles north of the Dundee city boundary and stretches to the highest point in the Sidlaw Hills, as well as The Hideaway Experience, a luxury retreat for couples. They began with a converted bothy and then went on to create four other retreats. One of her many other hats is running the Go Rural for Business consultancy to help support the development of agritourism and food and drink producers, and she now leads Scottish Agritourism which brings experts and operators together.ldquoAs devastating as some aspects of running a rural business were last year, I think we have emerged from it as a stronger farming tourism network, she added. ldquoI think when we are able to welcome the international market back,we can keep the momentum going, people might consider Scotland as an agritourism destination.ldquoIt has taken us some time to reach this stage even with the setbacks due to coronavirus, but we have seen a knock-on effect with people wanting to get out to green spaces, enjoy fresh air and good, local produce.

It is due to the Rangers v Celtic match on Saturday, January .The match was shown on a TV channel that requires a long-term subscription and many Glaswegians cannot afford such luxuries, but they were so desperate to watch the match they they crowded into small flats of the few who did have subscriptions and ignored social distancing laws. By keeping the volume of TV commentary low the police would not be able to catch the culprits, especially since this happened at many locations all at once.I note that Celtic have been in the United Arab Emirates this past week. It is a place that has strict censorship and refuses to admit that it has many Covid- cases.What a dreadful example they are setting.

It was little more than a regurgitation of misinformation which has been pedalled in much of our media over the last four years.I also heard the selected highlights of Donald Trumprsquos leaked phone-call with Georgiarsquos Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, which provided Mr Maughanrsquos inspiration. It comprised little more than the President urging him to do his job properly by reacting to evidence of election fraud in his state. Inaction in the face of wrongdoing facilitates the injustice. But Mr Raffensperger is compromised, as witnessed by his willingness to attempt to damage Mr Trump.In spite of four years of ceaseless attacks from the media, a phoney impeachment and treacherous officialdom, Mr Trumprsquos record of achievement is impressive: in international affairs he started no new wars, defeated Islamic State, revamped the military, signed not one but four Middle East peace deals, defused a tense stand-off with North Korea, exposed Iranian ill-will on the nuclear deal and, most importantly, confronted the Chinese Communist Partyrsquos hegemony and litany of abuses at home he produced a booming economy and record stock markets, achieved record high black and Latino employment rates, punctured the absurdly expensive green deal balloon, managed  per cent reduction in illegal immigration by , effected Obamacare reform and extracted warp-speed vaccine development.He achieved more in  months than Joe Biden achieved in  years in political le.

Had the mainstream media properly reported and discussed the ious allegations of material electoral fraud the issue might well have been defused. Also,the Supreme Court had heard the challenge brought by Texas and endorsed by Mr Trump that would have helped to close isions.While claims of interference by a rogues gallery of foreign states are entirely implausible, many of the other allegations are not.Suggestions that vote-counting machines were linked to the internet and could be remotely hacked could best be described as ldquoI want to know more.Some evidence produced definitely warranted detailed investigation ndash notably the glitches in certain vote counts where blocks of votes suddenly switched from Mr Trump to Joe Biden.Statistical evidence goes further and at least raises doubts as to the overall result. The simplest is that Mr Biden got by far the largest-ever presidential vote off a record low for a winning candidate of  counties to more than , won by Mr Trump. However, as both the mainstream media and the Supreme Court chose not to canvas and thereby defuse these matters, the distrust and ision will fester, to the severe weakening of America, a result which will undermine our security here in Britain.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.BLACK MARKS FOR RED TAPEFIFTY years ago, a hospital was run very efficiently by a superintendent, a matron and a secretary. They knew their job and ran a team who also knew the job and had freedom to do it. If needed, they collaborated with colleagues in nearby hospitals. Fty years ago the councillor in charge of education had a business background and would make a decision in a lunch break, setting out clear criteria for judging outcomes.Now our hospitals are over-run with a plague of administrators , who need to take over ward space to accommodate growing numbers and who are unavailable after pm, leaving nursing staff to take urgent decisions. Now in local government we have a six-week committee cycle so administrators, often with no business acumen, can shuffle mounds of paper and decide what to tell elected members. Fty years ago, administrators were a support resource for frontline staff who delivered the goods. Now they are the frontline staff who suck resources out of the system and in some cases are paid more than the Prime Minister.James Watson, Dunbar.Read more: We must not let the old wither away for the sake of the young"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-teachers-tackled-ferocious-whirlpool-fuelled-chocolate","story":"But for four daring Glasgow teachers, the sugary snacks would be the rather unusual fuel that would power them through the adventure of a letime into the swirling, treacherous waters of one of the worldrsquos strongest whirlpools.Tucked into their kayaks ndash with everything they needed to survive almost a month in Arctic waters including Cabana bars and Angel Delight for nourishment and emergency flares made from old pipes - the intrepid team set off to conquer the Maelstrom.On their way to successfully circumnavigating the two island groups of Lofoten and Vesteraringlen in North West Norway and  miles within the Arctic Circle, theyrsquod battle through the wild waters of the notorious whirlpool twice, overcome food poisoning and swelter in their thermals as the normally icy region endured a blistering heatwave.At the end of it, they ed home having claimed a unique Scottish first for sea kayaking and a remarkable tribute to the Scots father of the sport.Soon the extraordinary  efforts of Jim Breen, Angus Mathieson, Bill Turnbull and Peter Wilson to become the first to beat the Maelstrom in tiny sea kayaks, will be retold in an exhibition at the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine.Included in the exhibition, originally curated to mark the th anniversary of the crossing, will be two of the four lsquoBaidarka Explorerrsquo kayaks which carried them  milesacross Arctic Circle waters and through the series of tidal eddies and whirlpools made famous by Edgar Allan Poersquos  story, A Descent into the Maelstrom.Alongside will be, by todayrsquos standards, the shockingly simple supplies they carried with them: Cabana bars and Angel Delight, rather flimsy compass and head torches, hastily adapted plastic chemical containers which carried the teamrsquos first aid and repair kit, and homemade emergency flares created from plumbing waste pipes.Basic as it seems, the Scottish Kayak Expedition to North West Norway was the result of two years of meticulous planning and fundraising, which saw the Glasgow-based team of secondary school teachers spend hours studying maps and books at the cityrsquos Mitchell Library as they plotted their course into the history books.The idea, recalls Jim, was sparked by the frustration of finding themselves storm-bound on a west coast island in  after a sea kayaking outing ground to a halt. With nothing  to do, they made a pact to embark on Scotlandrsquos first major sea kayaking expedition together.ldquoSea kayaking was a small world at the time and only a couple of dozen people were serious about it, recalls Jim, who was  at the time.ldquoSome had done some major expeditions, but they were all English. Although Inuits and Native Americans had been kayaking for thousands of years they treated it as a way of le. The sport of kayaking was started by a Scot, John MacGregor, in the s.ldquoWe thought that as the sport was started by a Scot, there needed to be a major expedition by Scots.The Falkland Islands were considered but ruled out because of the sheer distance involved in getting there. Another idea to cross the Baltic Sea and kayak along the Russian coast was dismissed because Cold War relations at the time were not expected to have led to a warm welcome.Having already tackled the notorious Corryvreckan Whirlpool between Jura and Scarba, one of the worldrsquos largest of its kind, the team opted to try another.ldquoThe temptation of attempting the worldrsquos largest seemed like an appropriate challenge, said Jim. ldquoThere was no Google search available then, so we searched the Mitchell Library for books about it. We thought it would be perfect, it was up there in the Arctic and there was a whole island group to kayak around.The adventure caught the imagination of sponsors who poured pound, into the expedition and showered the team with goods ndash from Cabana bars and Angel Delight to thermal underwear which, as the thermometer hit # had to be rapidly discarded.The team set off from Harstad in North West Norway on July , , and travelled north around the top of the island of Hinnoslashya, south down the West Coast of the Vesteraringlen and Lofoten island groups to the island of Vaeligroslashy at the southern tip.Here, between Lofoten Point and the island of Mosken, where the tidal currents are forced through the shallows creating a fast series of eddies and whirlpools, they crossed the infamous but deceptively lsquosmoothrsquo Maelstrom.Jim adds: ldquoWe never had any doubts that we could do it. But I remember my we being quite upset about it. As we left from Glasgow airport, she thought we were going to our deaths.ldquoWe didnrsquot think twice about it being dangerous ndash until we got there.After having lit their night-time kayaking perfectly, the -hour midnight sun suddenly turned overcast leaving the team with a dreadful sense of doom.Jim recalls: ldquoWe timed the crossing for when the tides were running the slowest but itrsquos a complex area and a huge area of tidal water through a relatively narrow gap about two miles wide where the water runs very fast.ldquoAs soon as the wind combines with fast tides it becomes a dangerous bit of water.ldquoItrsquos like trying to cross a river and the river is trying to push you down. You donrsquot know where the tide might take you. There was a lot of adrenalin.As well as the challenges of crossing the Maelstrom twice, the team had to overcome very severe magnetic anomalies on certain stretches of the trip.Their food was bland and repetitive, usually oatcakes, Dairylea cheese spread and tomato pickle which, having been stored in the nose of their kayaks for weeks before departure, ended up tainted by styrene gas which seeped from the resin coating and left two of the team battling food poisoning.ldquoBy the end, I never wanted to see another Cabana bar as long I lived, adds Jim.Nicola Scott, Exhibitions and Events Officer at the Scottish Maritime Museum, says the Scottish Kayak Expedition was an exciting highpoint in the history of sea kayaking.ldquoNot only was it the first major sea kayaking expedition and the first recorded sea kayak crossing of the Maelstrom, it offers a fascinating insight into the challenges and development of sea kayaking in the latter half of the th century, she says.ldquoThe kayak was invented some  years ago in Arctic North America when Inuit people stretched animal skins over drtwood or whalebone frames as a means to hunt sea animals and move around by water.ldquoAlthough the sport of kayaking sparked interest in Europe in the s, it wasnrsquot until the s when the hardshell resin and fibreglass kayaks used on the  expedition were developed.ldquoThe  expedition team also helped move sea kayak design on. The limitations of equipment at the time meant that they needed to design some of their own kit to overcome the cold and wet conditions.ldquoAltogether, the exhibition tells a captivating story of real adventure.Into the Maelstrom: The Scottish Kayak Expedition to North West Norway  will be held at the Scottish Maritime Museum once Covid- restrictions allow."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12211901.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-might-not-seeing-gp-covid-jag","story":"From tomorrow, GP practices across Scotland will begin inoculating the over-s, starting with the oldest patients on their list, with Nicola Sturgeon predicting that this age group should be fully vaccinated within four weeks.Unlike England however, where the programme is GP-led, it is unclear to what extent general practice will be involved in immunisations going forward, in the other priority age groups over  and for high-risk shielding patients.Nor is it the case that all GP practices will be carrying out Covid vaccinations to the over-s, as they are not obliged to do so and a small number have opted out.James Shaw, from Dundee, was one of the first people over  in Scotland to receive the Oxford vaccine, but many GP surgeries are still waiting on initial supplies with the programme moving to primary care settings tomorrowUnder the terms of Scotlandrsquos unique GP contract, negotiated between BMA Scotland and the Scottish Government in , responsibility for vaccinations transferred from GPs to health boards, to be delivered through regional health and social care partnerships .This is how the winter flu programme was delivered this year, although many GP practices continued to vaccinate adults aged  to  with underlying conditions.The centralisation of the scheme faced a barrage of criticism, however, with some elderly people facing long journeys on multiple buses to reach vaccination hubs, appointment letters dispatched by a private contractor on behalf of National Services Scotland turning up late, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire in particular coming under fire for using a recall system that meant -year-olds were invited weeks ahead of those in their s, who were most at risk from flu.: Anger over flu vaccine rollout that will see oldest get jags lastDr John Montgomery, lead clinician at the David Elder Medical Practice, is among those keen to avoid any of these errors being repeated with the Covid vaccine rollout.His practice, in the Govan area of Glasgow, has received its first batch of  Oxford vaccine doses and they intend to vaccinate all their patients over  - with the exception of those who are housebound - on Tuesday.He said: ldquoThe uptake looks like its going to be excellent. The advantage with this vaccine is that people donrsquot have to wait around for  minutes after its done, like they do with the Pfizer vaccine, so patients can turn up for their appointment and be in and out in minutes.The surgery is one of the  out of the  in south Glasgow which are taking part in Covid vaccinations of the over-s.Many have yet to receive their first vaccine batches, but these are expected arrive within the next two weeks.Dr Montgomery, who is also chair of the south Glasgow GP committee, said the ergence between Scotland and England is likely to leave the public confused, and added that there is ldquohuge willingness among GPs to take on a bigger role.ldquoTherersquos going to be a lot of expectation from the public that theyrsquoll be going to their GP practice to be vaccinated, but as things stand thatrsquos not the case.ldquoWersquove got no information yet on what will happen when we get to the  to -year-olds, for example.ldquoTherersquos an order in which folks are going to be done, but right now there isnrsquot any detail about how and where itrsquos going to be done.\"But GPs and their teams want to have greater involvement in vaccinating their own patients in their own premises, particularly those at high risk, and are pushing hard for this.\"Dr John Montgomery, lead clinician at the David Elder Medical Practice in Govan, GlasgowDr Montgomery added: ldquoA lot of us want to do more than the over-s. In England itrsquos very much a GP-led vaccination programme but to my mind we should be involved in the shielded group. Thatrsquos an obvious one and that makes up about .% of our list.ldquoAnd following on from that, the at-risk under-s who we covered in the flu group.ldquoOnce yoursquore getting down to under-s and lower risk groups, sure you can use your football stadiums and your Louisa Jordans and get as many people as possible involved in administering it.ldquoBut I think we need to be making plans now in Scotland, because England seems to be very clear about how itrsquos going to administer these programmes and, at the moment, wersquore a wee bit behind the curve.: Are we priorising the flu vaccine fairly - and why is Indonesia immunising its working age population first In England, vaccinations of over-s in the community - using the Pfizer vaccine - began in GP practices on December , before being extended to care home residents a week later.In Scotland, care home vaccinations started earlier, on December  and ldquowell over half of residents have now been given their first dose.Dr Montgomery stressed that greater involvement could be complicated by the other pressures facing GPs, who are already juggling work in out-of-hours clinics and community Covid assessment centres along with their existing workload of video, telephone, and in-person consultations.ldquoDemand for routine care has not fallen as it did in March, said Dr Montgomery.ldquoSo the worry is that practices may start to collapse with a combination of staff absences and rising demand. Which is when it comes back to why itrsquos so important to vaccinate the vaccinators.ldquoThere is a lsquobuddy systemrsquo in place, so thatone practice caves due to staff shortages another can step in to deal with their patients, but the worry is that that has a domino effectit has to be used.ldquoThe same applies to staffing the Covid centresdemand increases there over the next few weeks.ldquoBut even with all these pressures and out-of-hours, and GPs struggling to do their daytime job, they still want to do more Covid vaccinations.On Wednesday it emerged that GPs in London had been told to ldquostand down from routine work over the next two weeks in order to ldquofocus on urgent care and free up time for vaccinations.NHS England subsequently backtracked and told doctors to carry on with routine work, but by Friday the situation in the capital was being declared a major incident with one in  people infected in some areas and hospitals under ldquoimmense pressure.Not all health boards areas are delivering vaccinations in the same way in Scotland, however.Dr Iain Kennedy, Inverness GP and secretary of the Highland Local Medical CommitteeIn the Highlands - where GPs were never supportive of the  contractrsquos approach to immunisations - most doctors will be inoculating all over-s and priority patients on their lists.Dr Iain Kennedy, a GP in Inverness and secretary of the Highland Local Medical Committee , said their most recent survey found that over % of their members wanted to deliver the Covid vaccine to their patients, just as they did with the flu vaccine.The regions GP-led drive is believed to be one of the reasons why Highland achieved one of the highest flu jag uptake rates in Scotland this year.If an inidual practice does not want to inoculate under-s, the opportunity will be offered up to neighbouring practices first, before being offered to pharmacists and optometrists.Practices close to hospitals, such as Raigmore in Inverness, Caithness General in Wick, and the Belford in Fort William, are more likely to receive batches of the Pfizer vaccine due to the logistical dficulties of storing and transporting it at -degC.Those further afield will receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.: Real risk some Pfizer vaccines will be wasted after U-turn on second dose, warns medic - as BMA calls for second appointments to be reinstatedDr Kennedy said he had been given assurance by the BMA that any GP practices across Scotland which want a bigger role in the Covid rollout will be allowed to do so.He said: ldquoIrsquom hearing a mixed approach from GP colleagues across Scotland.\"There are some health board areas that are taking the same approach as us in Highland, there are other groups of GPs who are at the opposite end of the spectrum where they want to see the health board take complete ownership of the delivery, then there are GPs in between who are willing to contribute where they can.ldquoSome parts of the country are clearly feeling the pressure more than others.ldquoI can understand why things might be confusing to the public in Scotland, particularly given that GPs in England have been administering the vaccine for two or three weeks.\"Unfortunately I think this is one of the unintended consequences of the new GP contract in Scotland where centralising the vaccine in hospitals rather than like Englandsprimary care networks has resulted in a slower start to the programme.In Edinburgh, Dr Iain Morrison is among the GPs who wants to have a bigger role.Although he stresses he does support the GP contracts objective of delegating responsibility for vaccinations, in general, to health boards, he says the pandemic is a \"unique situation\".Dr Iain Morrison, chair of Lothian LMCDr Morrison, who is chair of the Lothian LMC and a partner a Newbattle Medical Practice in Edinburgh, said: \"We are vaccinating our frontline staff and the over-s within practice. However, there is appetite to deliver more.\"We fully appreciate itrsquos not as simple as it being general practice only - under no circumstance do we want the delegated- but we do want to help.ldquoThere is concern that without general practice involvement the wider programme may not be as efficient as it could be.ldquoI would like to be involved in vaccinating anyone who is unable to attend one of the mass centres. Therersquos concern about the health inequalities of mass centres.\"I work in a very deprived area and our nearest mass centre currently is going be Queen Margaret University, which requires several trips on public transport which is counter-intuitive in a pandemic.\"If we have  sites within general practice in Lothian, that allows for a much more local distribution, which helps reduce health inequality.ldquoBut we canrsquot do everything - we canrsquot continue doing all general medical services and the biggest vaccination programme of all time, so we do need the majority of vaccinations to be delivered centrally.Dr Morrison urged the public to be patient until vaccines become available.He said: ldquoEverybody is keen to get going, the willingness is there across the whole sector - but wersquore a bit hamstrung by the bottleneck of supply.ldquoWe are fielding a huge amount of calls regarding the vaccination programme, but the NHS will contact your when itrsquos time for your vaccination - please donrsquot contact us, in the nicest possible way.\"Because unlike the first lockdown, wersquore not seeing any drop in demand for standard services.\"It is busier than ever. We had a record day on Tuesday for the amount of patient contacts in our practice, and only a fraction of that was Covid-related.: Warning rollout of Covid jags to over-s could be delayed by shortage of vaccinated GPs and primary care staffDr Lewis Morrison, chair of BMA Scotland and a consultant geriatrician in East Lothian, said he expected the bulk of vaccinations in his area to be delivered \"in NHS Lothian facilities - not GP practices\".He added: ldquoIn England it will be GP-delivered in Scotland it will be more a case that GPs will help where the geography and their availability to do so enables them, and secondly their premises.ldquoIt may be that some GP localities are involved in vaccination, but the primary responsibility for delivering it lies with the health boards. \"A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoGPs have a signicant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank GPs for their hard work as the over-s community roll-out begins.ldquoWersquore moving at pace to ensure that over-s who - alongside care home residents - are highest on the priority list, get the vaccine by the end of this month.ldquoWe will of course be discussing with GPs and other clinicians the next phases of community vaccine roll out as we work to getting all . million over-s vaccinated by May."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-world-altered-states---bankrupt-lying-reality-tv-host-irrevocably-broken-usa","story":"Amid the flurry of responses in the US press these past days to the unprecedented scenes in the Capitol, some lines from one article caught my eye.They were written by David Brooks, an op-ed columnist for The New York Times and seem to distill the poison that plagues America right now. Let me quote those lines here.ldquoBut there are dark spectres running through our nation ndash beasts with shaggy manes and feral teeth. They have the stench of Know-Nothingism, the hot blood of the lynchers, and they ride the winds of nihilistic fury, wrote Brooks.:Iain Macwhirter: Trumps stupid white riot has handed the future to the leftThose spectres, that fury, those lynchers have, of course, long existed in America. But few now within Washingtonrsquos corridors of power and among its citizenry are in any doubt that those who make up the current ranks of such hatemongers were openly stirred into action last Wednesday by President Donald Trump.Trumprsquos subsequent address to the nation on Friday, in which he finally conceded the election to President-elect Joe Biden and promised an ldquoorderly transition of power, is fooling few. The president has spoken too often with forked tongue for any but the most gullible to be taken in again.As many observers have remarked, the whole ldquoconciliatory tone of Trumprsquos televised address was at odds with the manrsquos character and bizarrely reminiscent of those speeches made by hostages under duress.The words might have come from the presidentrsquos mouth, but no-one for a moment believed that it was what he wanted to say or that the script had not been carefully written by other, more rational iniduals.Those that drafted the speech did so perhaps through misguided loyalty or were simply ordered to, so helping protect Trump from legal exposure related to events that played out last Wednesday. Whatever their motives, the speech was a sign of how vulnerable Trump now is.But as experience has shown, with vulnerability comes Trump rage and potential backlash. According to White House sources cited by the US press, the president is said to be ldquoconsumed with anger, ldquoranting and ldquoin a very dark place.They say Trump is more preoccupied with his election loss than remorseful for the riot or deaths that resulted from the violence at the Capitol last week.ldquoItrsquos like watching someone self-destruct in front of your very eyes, and you canrsquot do anything, one adviser who recently spoke to Trump was quoted by The Wall Street Journal as saying.Butthe president is angry and in a dark or uncertain place, then so too is America at this moment in time. Trump and what he might do next remains unfinished business ndash as does what should be done about him and those who did his bidding in what Biden called an ldquoinsurrection and others an attempted ldquocoup.Three years,  months and  days after Trump warned from the West Front of the US Capitol building that ldquoAmerican carnage stops right here, the very spot on which he stood making that inaugural address was engulfed by his own protesters bringing carnage of their own.EvenTrump does leave office in  daysrsquo time, Biden, in his own inaugural speech, will know that hersquos left with the daunting challenge of picking up the pieces of that carnage and healing the festering wound that comes with it.Hardly surprising, then, that many see the place to start in tacking such challenges is in ensuring Trumprsquos capacity to personally foment more trouble is emasculated once and for all.But for Biden, much as he would like to see Trump and others held accountable, this poses something of a political dilemma.:The most memorable and controversial tweets from Donald TrumpAs CNN journalist Jeff Zeleny perceptively asked on Friday, would the new president really want his first  days to be about Trumprsquos last two weeks Biden has so much he needs to get done ndash tacking the coronavirus pandemic that still ravages America being an obvious priority. Then there are the issues of Obamacare and tax revisions.Becoming bogged down with a protracted legal battle over Trumprsquos abuses would not only absorb valuable time and energy but ensure wounds remained open while angering ldquoordinary Trump supporters and his extremist far-right cadres alike.Then again, such threats to the new administration and Americarsquos democracy will never recede unless Biden and the Democrats, along with those Republicans who recognise the danger, take concerted action against Trump.As time of writing, calls for invoking the th Amendment ndash allowing for the removal of a president from office or further impeachment proceedings against Trump ndash are gaining volume and traction. Options that were deemed somewhat distant at the start of last week are now common currency in Washington discourse.But as a Financial Times editorial also pointed out, neither invoking the Amendment nor impeachment guarantees order. Each would almost certainly increase the far-rightrsquos baseless sense of dispossession and Trump doesnrsquot need formal office from which to inflame them.Meanwhile, itrsquos a measure of the bad place in which Trump now finds himself that Jay Timmons, the head of a major US business group that represents , companies including ExxonMobil Corp, Pfizer Inc and Toyota Motor Corp, has urged senior political figures to consider removing the president.Trump ldquoincited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favour of anarchy, said Timmons, chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, a business body usually politically well-disposed towards Trump and his Republican administration.For the th Amendment to be invoked, vice-president Mike Pence and most of Trumprsquos Cabinet would need to declare that Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency and remove him. Pence would take over in that scenario, but he has reportedly ruled out the idea even though pressure on him to do so continues to mount.Meanwhile, other voices calling for Trumprsquos ouster are more predictable. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, and Chuck Schumer, the soon-to-be Senate majority leader, have called for the Amendment to be invoked and warned that they would proceed with impeachment efforts otherwise.These and other Democrats are joined by a growing number of Republicans who have joined the chorus for Trump to be removed from office, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly and the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan.The reality, though, is that the constitutional mechanisms to remove the president are cumbersome and give him the benefit of the doubt. That said, the arguments and capacity to do so remain and in Trumprsquos case are perhaps more clear-cut, say some legal experts.Frank Bowman, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Missouri, said Trump ldquoarguably fomented sedition, or an attempted overthrowing of the US government.But Bowman said Trump could also be impeached for a more general offence: disloyalty to the US Constitution and failing to uphold his oath of office. Congress has discretion in defining a high crime and misdemeanour and is not limited to actual criminal offences.ldquoThe essential offence would be one against the Constitution ndash one of essentially trying to undermine the lawful results of a lawfully conducted election, Bowman said, speaking to Reuters news agency.There is also an argument that an impeachment could be continued after Trump leaves office. Some observers say that potentially impeachment is even more valuable than removing him by Amendment because it would bar him from holding public office in the future.Trump has said more than once he might run again for office in , eventhe toxicity associated with the Trump political name and brand is now such that this seems increasingly unlikely.Short of the pressing need to remove Trump quickly over fears he might yet again unleash his ldquotroll army, as one pundit called it, or detonate some political time bomb such as provoking Iran before his term ends, by far Bidenrsquos priority in response will be to establish calm and a renewed sense of confidence in Americarsquo s democratic processes and institutions.However, some US watchers insist itrsquos still too early to determine precisely what Bidenrsquos strategy towards Trump will be and what the attack on the Capitol means for America in the longer term. ldquoEither it marked the beginning of the end of Trumpism, or another stage in the unravelling of American liberal democracy, observed another NYT columnist, Michelle Goldberg, last week.While uncertainty remains, commentators and counterterrorism experts alike say it confirmed something that has been obvious for years now. In short, America has a national security problem in the form of the far-right.ldquoThe extremist violent faction views today as a huge win, Elizabeth Neumann, a former Trump counterterrorism official who has accused the president of encouraging white nationalists, told the NYT in the wake of last Wednesdayrsquos insurrection.Neumann also pointed out that ldquoThe Turner Diaries, the seminal white nationalist novel written by William Luther Pierce, published under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, depicting a violent revolution in America, features a mortar attack on the Capitol.ldquoThis is like a right-wing extremist fantasy that has been fulfilled, said Neumann of the recent events in Washington.But itrsquos not just the extremists who have to be called out, insist some critics of the Trump administration. This often-shadowy world of the far-right, fuelled by paranoia, conspiracy misinformation and grievance, has all too frequently received a helping hand from Americarsquos mainstream conservatives of which Trump is only part, critics insist.ldquoAlmost all of the Republicans on Capitol Hill let him do it. They aided and abetted him. They voted to acquit him of impeachment charges. They endorsed him for re-election, explained Susan B Glasser, staff writer at The New Yorker, who writes on le in Trumprsquos Washington.Even after Trump decisively lost the election, Glasser points out, Republicans across Washington went along with him as he spread lies and conspiracy theories.ldquoWhen Trump called for a final reckless coup against the constitutional order, many were willing to follow him even to this legal, political, and moral dead end ndash cynical opportunists like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, in the Senate, and a majority of House Republicans, including their leader, Kevin McCarthy, of Calornia. But now not all, Glasser continued, hinting at some sht in thinking.In the coming days there will be many questions to ponder over what happened last week in the Capitol. Questions over security and those asking what efforts are being made to identy and charge those Trump supporters who attacked police  Questions too will continue over what to do about Trump himself Then there will be the even bigger ones to ponder about Americarsquos democratic credentials and place in the world.Writing in Foreign Policy magazine these past few days, Eric Bjornlund, president of Democracy International, the US-based organisation that advises and assists on behalf of governments, ministries and NGOs in governance projects, summed up how pressing answers to all these questions now are for Americarsquos political wellbeing.ldquoBased on my experience working on election observation and democracy promotion in some  countries over the last -plus years, I am convinced that the chances of the US remaining a genuine democracy may well depend on the way the countryrsquos leaders and institutions now react, observed Bjornlund, who firmly believes that Trump must now be removed or impeached.ldquoMobs storming parliaments are all but a definition of a fragile democracy, he added in warning.This weekend, barely  days before Joe Biden is sworn in as the th President of the United States, Trump remains a loose political cannon ndash fully primed.As I write, two news stories are breaking from the wire services on my computer. The first, not surprisingly, is that Trump will break with custom and not attend Bidenrsquos inauguration. The second, from the Financial Times, rather chillingly reads: ldquoPelosi contacts US military officer to warn of lsquounstable presidentrsquo launching nuclear strike.Yes, Donald Trumprsquos authority might be ebbing before our eyes, but he remains president for the next  days barring moves to drag him out of the White House.He also remains both stubborn and dangerous. Even when gone from the Oval Office, his malign presence will continue to bedevil and imperil America for some time to come."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-keir-starmer-says-divisive-indyref2-not-priority-scots","story":"The Labour leader said the status quo \"isnt working\" but insisted there are other things that can be done.However he said he did not agree with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who suggested a second referendumshould not take place until .Sir Keirwas asked about the issue during an interview on the BBCs Andrew Marr Show.He said: \"I dont think there should be another referendum.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”. vw, px\"  Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.” vw, px\"  Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times.

The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s.

We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.” vw, px\"  A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honourscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can. During the new contract, Loganair has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years. Loganair is a key participant in several projects to bring low or zero-carbon technology to commercial air transport, and will be supporting flight trials of two separate programmes # hydrogen-powered and electrically-powered aircraft # at its base in the Orkney Islands in the first half of .It is the only UK regional airline invited to participate in the UK Government’s Jet Zero Council initiatives to de-carbonise future air travel.Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “We’re delighted and privileged to have been chosen to deliver Orkney’s essential Inter-Island air services for a further four years.   It’s a vital service for the prosperity of the North Isles, and our ability to retain this contract is entirely due to the experience and hard work of our dedicated team in Kirkwall.“The four-year contract award provides us with certainty on which to plan for the future – whether that be the transition to new low or zero-carbon technology or in the recruitment and training of staff in Orkney to work on the Inter-Isles operation.   The North Isles services are a key part of Loganair’s DNA, and despite our expansion as an airline, we remain today as committed as ever to serving the communities of Orkney.”OIC chairman of development and infrastructure, Councillor Graham Sinclair said: “Communities in our North Isles have been served by Loganair for more than half a century and now, following a competitive tendering process, the airline has been awarded the four-year contract once again.“In these ever-challenging times with uncertainty around every corner, I am sure the continuity of service will be welcomed by residents.“I also welcome Loganair’s future plans which include conversion to use of low-carbon propulsion which can only but assist with our attempts to reduce our carbon footprint.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am also determined that any support is over and above what is already being made available.“Once these details and the options have been fleshed out, I will work with the council and the finance secretary to ensure arrangements are put in place as quickly as possible.#Promises of funding are all very well, but many businesses are on a kne-edge right now and urgently need access to this support”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Before the  congress, Kim Jong Un had led the party with the title of ldquofirst secretary.Since inheriting power upon his fatherrsquos death in late , Kim, , has gradually consolidated his grip on power through a series of high-profile executions and purges that removed his potential rivals.He has also taken up a spate of top jobs that includes chairman of the State Affairs Commission and supreme commander of the Northrsquos . million-member military, along with the top party post.The two late North Korean leaders have kept posthumous titles mdash Kim Jong Il remains ldquoeternal general secretary and Kim Il Sung is ldquoeternal president.The Kim family has ruled North Korea with a strong personality cult that elevated key family members to a god-like status since Kim Il Sung founded the country in .Their familyrsquos mythical ldquoPaektu bloodline, named after the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula, only gives their direct family members the rights to rule the impoverished yet nuclear-armed nation.Among notable personnel changes announced on Monday was the name of Kim Jong Unrsquos influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, missing from a new list of officials at the partyrsquos powerful Politburo.Being in charge of relations with rival South Korea, she was an alternate member of the Politburo and some observers earlier predicted she would be promoted to a full member of the bureau in a bid by her brother to reinforce the Kim familyrsquos rule.It was not immediately clear why the -year-old was dismissed from her Politburo post. vw,vw,px, px\"The title was formerly held by Mr Kimrsquos late father and grandfather Kim has previously inherited other high-profile titles by his father and grandfather, such as the militaryrsquos supreme commander.During the congress, Kim Jong Un vowed to enlarge his nuclear arsenal and build more sophisticated weapons systems to cope with what he calls intensying US hostile policy.He also admitted a previous five-year economic development plan failed and disclosed a new development that focuses on building a stronger self-reliant economy.Mr Kim has pushed the so-called ldquobyungjin policy of simultaneously seeking economic growth and the expansion of his nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the US.South Korearsquos military said on Monday it has obtained intelligence showing North Korea staged a military parade at a Pyongyang square the previous night. A statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was checking whether that was an actual parade or its rehearsal.South Korearsquos spy agency earlier said the North would hold a massive military parade in celebrations of the congress and in a show of force against the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden in the US.copy -.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester.

He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie said the group — which was set up in March last year in response to the first lockdown — was ready to go and in a stronger position this time around.“We’re back to where we were in the first lockdown but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3574441.jpg--.jpg?1609941600000\n","title":"cllr mccaughey gifts kells and connor primary school newly refurbished computers","story":"KELLS and Connor Primary School were given an early Christmas gt last week, as DUP Cllr William McCaughey presented two refurbished computers to the school.The computers were refurbished by GSC Computers who were delighted to help.

The Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church in Ireland and Roman Catholic Church made similar statements this afternoon. It follows a meeting this afternoon of the Northern Ireland Executive’s ‘Faith Leaders’ Forum’, which was convened by Junior Ministers, Gordon Lyons MLA and Declan Kearney MLA. Church leaders and other faith leaders received advice during the meeting from Dr Michael McBride, the Chief Medical Officer , and Professor Ian Young, Chief Scientic Advisor , regarding the worsening Coronavirus situation. Speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, the Clerk of the General Assembly and General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said, “Our churches are part of the local community and we recognise the very serious situation that Northern Ireland finds itself in today. With the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus, combined with the numbers in hospital and intensive care, the very clear warning from the CMO and CSA this afternoon was that over the next number of weeks this situation is going to worsen signicantly.” Mr Gribben continued, “In light of our ongoing consultations and the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with unequivocal public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have written to our congregations in Northern Ireland, informing them that all in person Sunday gatherings for worship, along with most other in person church gatherings, should cease in all PCI congregations from midnight tonight until Saturday,  February . “It is of course regrettable and disappointing that over these next few weeks our congregations will no longer be physically gathering for worship. However, because of the alarming rise of Covid- infections in the community, this is the right decision to take, both for the safety and protection of people and also to contribute to the overall reduction of inter-person contact in line with the government’s ‘stay at home’ message.” The Clerk concluded by saying, “In these dficult days, as we continue to look to God, and encourage others to find their hope in Him, let us help and pray for one another, lting up all those on the frontline, those in authority making dficult decisions and especially all who mourn and miss loved ones.” Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, John McDowell, said in a statement with his fellow bishops that the escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care is placing immense pressure on our healthcare staff. He added that the number of deaths and warnings from officials is of grave concern. We recognise that clergy and parishioners have together worked steadily to implement protocols which have ensured that public gatherings for worship have been as safe as possible since the re–opening of our buildings in early summer, said their statement. We also appreciate that the Northern Ireland Executive has acknowledged over the last  months the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. The ongoing engagement between faith communities and the Northern Ireland Executive is warmly welcomed and is something which we believe has been, and continues to be, of benefit to wider society. However, in light of the current serious and worsening situation and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that all public gatherings for worship and all other in–person church activities should cease for our particular denomination, until Saturday th February , subject to review in late January, with the exception of weddings, funerals, arrangements for recording and or live–streaming, drive–in services and private prayer . We note and welcome the fact that the same position has been adopted by the Presbyterian Church, Roman Catholic Church, Methodist Church and others in Northern Ireland. In making this decision for the ‘greater good’ of all within our community we continue to remember in our prayers the sick and bereaved, all who are suffering, those whose lives have been directly impacted by Covid–, praying too for those in positions of responsibility who are faced with making dficult decisions at this challenging time. A statement issued on behalf of Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, said the Catholic Church was very concerned at the current serious public health position in which Northern Ireland finds itself: with the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus the continuing escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care the number of associated deaths and, the increasingly unsustainable pressure on our healthcare staff. The statement, which was also signed by the other Catholic bishops from dioceses within Northern Ireland, added: The clear message from health officials is that this situation is going to worsen signicantly over the coming weeks. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possible stay at home for the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times. We make this decision reluctantly, conscious that not being able to gather for public worship can cause pain for all the faithful, but in the hope that this limited period of sacrice will be for the protection of le and health and for the greater good of all. We once more ask for prayers for the sick, the bereaved and all those whose livelihoods have been particularly impacted by the pandemic. We keep in our prayers all health workers, carers, chaplains and other essential workers. We welcome the announcement that a similar position is being taken by the leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland and many other denominations and faith communities in response to the unequivocal message from public health authorities that as many people as possible stay at home at this time. President of the Methodist Church,Rev Dr Tom McKnight, commented, “We made this decision in light of the clear advice from health officials that this action would be of benefit to public health and for the sake of the ‘Common Good’. As this Pandemic continues we are particularly mindful of those here and around the world whose lives are most profoundly impacted, people who are isolated, who are suffering or worried because of economic concerns, young people who carry a particular burden, those who are ill, and those who have lost loved ones. The church continues to be committed to doing all we can to support and stand with those in most need. As a church we continue to pray for those leading our country at this time."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?1610110925000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210108newsuk approval for moderna vaccine","story":"The Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.

It#s no dferent for some of our familiar faces.Cool FM DJ Pete Snodden#s day starts early with his top rating morning show.And these days he is even busier when he clocks off, arrives home and the school work begins. The day job, it seems, is child#s play.Dad to Ivana and Elayna, he has now found himself in the driving seat.I#ve been promoted from classroom assistant to head teacher, he said. Last time around my we Julia was the one in charge, this time she#s still working. It#s all on me and I#m feeling the pressure of long ision, Sometimes I think I#m happier to get the right answer than the kids!He said the novelty factor back in March kept things fresh and fun is starting to wear thin.Keeping it going is hard, he said.The idea of coming up with timetables was all new and in some ways exciting in March. Not so much this time.Now my eldest daughter is halfway through P. She should be working harder than ever. The work is more intense and we don#t want her to get behind. That#s a lot of pressure, but I feel for teachers too. Too much work and they#ll be criticised, too little and they#ll be criticised.What we#re doing is trying to strike a balance, but everyone#s le is dferent.Writer, author and working single mum Leesa Harker had embarked on the first bout of homeschooling with enthusiasm.But this time round she#s finding things far from plain sailing as she gets stuck into schoolwork with daughters Lola and Lexi. If I#ve learnt anything from last time, it#s that I need to learn more, she said.I#m already having a bit of a meltdown. It#s already obvious that some schools are much better at doing this than others.Today one of the girls had  minutes of work. The day before there was a link sent through for a YouTube exercise video for PE, that was it.But I#ve heard from other mums that their kids are getting work to keep them learning for hours. There does seem to be a real dference and it#s only going to increase fears that schools haven#t learnt how best to do this and that some kids will be so far behind when they get back into the classroom that it#s going to be dficult to catch up.The planning for this should have been better.Last year I felt we were all in the same boat. This time some of us are in a dinghy with a hole in the bottom while others are sailing off in expensive yachts.For BBC Radio Ulster presenter Kerry McLean, there is an extra workload this time around as her youngest daughter has just started P.I remember talking to my mum back in March and saying how glad I was that Eve was only four. But this time around she#s P and that#s probably turned out harder than I imagined.If I#ve learnt one thing, it#s that I made the right career choice in not going to be a teacher! With the older kids I can say now you need to do A, B or C. With Eve it#s a sticky fingered, hands on job.My kitchen is now part studio, part music store and three parts classroom. I need a bigger table!For Kerry, having three children at dferent stages of their education is proving a challenge.They need dferent things, she said. Tara is very self driven, Dan can be easily distracted by a cloud passing the window and with Eve it#s all cutting out and sticking. I try to keep my work under control so I can spend time with the kids and help them through.Their schools have been great, but I know there#s a big dference in the way other schools are able to manage.I refuse to compare myself with other parents.I won#t pretend to be Mary Poppins. If my kids go to bed at night with smiles on their faces, that#s good enough for me.Belfast Most ReadBallymena businessman denies throwing illegal super-spreader partiesGirls who posed on Mourne mountain top rubbish claims they had to be rescuedPortrush woman accused of using Mrs Brown#s Boys ruse to scam charityCool FM DJ Andy Baird taken off air over his Trump tweetsAwkward start for Eamonn and Ruth#s successorsLatest EducationExecutive urged to rethink decision on keeping nurseries open amid staff fearsChrissie RussellOpinionChildren need fewer tests and more educationMinisters clash as transfer test row no closer to being resolvedMark BainOpinionExams standoff is a lesson in Northern Ireland#s uneasy relationship with selection testsLatest from Belfast Crawley celebrate ‘absolutely deserved’ win as Leeds crash out of FA CupCES : The tech show prepares for its first ever virtual conventionNorth Korea’s Kim Jong Un adds title: General secretary of ruling partyPelosi: House ‘will proceed’ to impeachment of President TrumpWhat the papers say – January ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In an interview with the Belfasttoday, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said there was no reason for companies shipping from Great Britain to put orders from customers here on hold.Read MoreBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea border He said he would contact Peloton as there#s no reason for them in terms of parcels deliveries to have any issue. Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered. We are working to resume full service and sales in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.She added: Our existing members in Northern Ireland are not affected by this pause to new sales and still have full access to our service, as well as the ability to arrange a service appointment or a refund for their Peloton Bike or Bike+. A spokeswoman for white goods and electricals retailer AO confirmed that its deliveries here were on hold.They added: Like some other online retailers, changes to customs arrangements for deliveries to Northern Ireland mean it will take a few weeks for us and our delivery partner to make the necessary adjustments. We expect that this will only affect the first few weeks of .Electricals retailer Currys also said it was business as usual for customers and deliveries.Belfast Most ReadBallymena businessman denies throwing illegal super-spreader partiesGirls who posed on Mourne mountain top rubbish claims they had to be rescuedPortrush woman accused of using Mrs Brown#s Boys ruse to scam charityCool FM DJ Andy Baird taken off air over his Trump tweetsAwkward start for Eamonn and Ruth#s successorsLatest Northern IrelandMurder probe as victim of Co Antrim assault diesNumber of Covid- hospital patients will double within days – NI health chiefs accidental gun discharges by PSNI officers over past six yearsPolice seize suspected Class A drugs worth £, during Tobermore searchDebate on Irish reunication should not be around language of ‘threat or danger’, says Mary Lou McDonaldLatest from Belfast Crawley celebrate ‘absolutely deserved’ win as Leeds crash out of FA CupCES : The tech show prepares for its first ever virtual conventionNorth Korea’s Kim Jong Un adds title: General secretary of ruling partyPelosi: House ‘will proceed’ to impeachment of President TrumpWhat the papers say – January ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During this time, we will work with our customers to validate and correct the data we have in our system, to reduce the delays and enable us to resume normal service.“This pause in our operation will be as short as possible and we intend to recommence this service on Wednesday January .”🔈STATEMENT, Thursday th January, :pm pic gGqOksKw— Seafood From ScotlandJanuary , Donna Fordyce, chief executive at Seafood Scotland, said exporters faced “new bureaucratic non-tarf barriers” with no one body able to fix the situation.“It’s a perfect storm for Scottish seafood exporters. Weakened by Covid-, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,” she said.“IT problems in France meant consignments were erted from Boulogne sur Mer to Dunkirk, which was unprepared as it wasn’t supposed to be at the export front line. There have also been HMRC IT issues on the UK side that need to resolved ASAP regarding certication.“A lack of knowledge and understanding of the required paperwork means some companies are ill-prepared for the new checks, which are taking far longer because of the mistakes being uncovered. When the systems settle down, checks should be carried out on samples from each load but now entire consignments are having to be checked to satisfy requirements.”MS boss Steve Rowe warned that the trade agreement between the UK and the EU is causing problems with “potential tarfs on part of our range exported to the EU, together with very complex administrative processes”.Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at ChristmasJim McMahon, shadow transport secretaryHaulier industry body Logistics UK said deliveries were being delayed as lorries arrived in Belfast with incomplete paperwork.In order to avoid a hard border with the Republic, Mr Johnson agreed Northern Ireland would remain in the EU single market – but that has meant checks on goods arriving from Great Britain.Irish customs authorities said they would temporarily relax regulations around goods moving from Great Britain.Labour accused the Government of failing to properly prepare for the end of the transition period on December .Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “The Government promised it had a plan to make sure things ran smoothly for businesses and hauliers post-Brexit.“It’s clear the problems caused by its poor preparation and delaying tactics have not gone away. Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at Christmas.”A Government spokesman said: “Businesses and hauliers have made huge strides to get ready but we were always clear that there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period.“Although many businesses have moved goods successfully since January , we are aware of some issues, and are providing guidance and support.“Hauliers can use our ‘Check a HGV is ready’ service to make sure they have correct paperwork, and must obtain a Kent Access Permitthey plan to travel via Dover or Eurotunnel.”PAMost ReadBallymena businessman denies throwing illegal super-spreader partiesGirls who posed on Mourne mountain top rubbish claims they had to be rescuedPortrush woman accused of using Mrs Brown#s Boys ruse to scam charityCool FM DJ Andy Baird taken off air over his Trump tweetsAwkward start for Eamonn and Ruth#s successorsLatest Northern IrelandMurder probe as victim of Co Antrim assault diesNumber of Covid- hospital patients will double within days – NI health chiefs accidental gun discharges by PSNI officers over past six yearsPolice seize suspected Class A drugs worth £, during Tobermore searchDebate on Irish reunication should not be around language of ‘threat or danger’, says Mary Lou McDonaldLatest from Belfast CES : The tech show prepares for its first ever virtual conventionNorth Korea’s Kim Jong Un adds title: General secretary of ruling partyPelosi: House ‘will proceed’ to impeachment of President TrumpWhat the papers say – January Mass injection sites open as people urged to abide by lockdown rules,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

From mid-December  to early January , like the rest of the country, Derry experienced its coldest winter on record when temperatures stayed below  degrees centigrade for days on end. It was the third coldest winter in succession that brought heavy snowfalls, record low temperatures, travel chaos and school closures. The River Foyle, the fastest-flowing river in Europe for its size, froze over , City of Derry Airport was forced to close, sporting fixtures postponed and many Christmas parties and festive nights out with family and friends were cancelled. googletag.cmd.push  Speaking at the time, John Wylie, from the Met Office, said: Sub-zero tem- peratures, widespread deep snow and all of the correct factors coming together at the right time to give us this weather event which will probably go down in history. A temperature of -. degC was recorded in Ballykelly on December , . On the same day, Castlederg in County Tyrone was put firmly on the map - not only did it set a new record Northern Ireland lowest temperature, but it was also the coldest spot on the entire island as the thermometer fell to -.C. The Arctic weather conditions first struck in  . googletag.cmd.push This was followed by the winter of   which for much of the country was worst since  , bringing widespread and heavy snowfalls. Despite the entire country being covered in a blanket of snow,  was not regarded as a White Christmas as no snow fell on Christmas Day.  The scene in Brooke Park in   in a photo taken by Ashlene Joyce. However, just like today, Derry showed its kind nature as a number of community groups took the initiative in ensuring that vulnerable people were looked after during the wintery weather. Volunteers in a number of areas visited elderly people in their homes distributing food and winter clothing and helping with shopping.     Members of the Leafair Community Association  handed out Winter Health Packs to local residents. The packs – distributed in partnership with the Neighbourhood Health Improvement Project– included a thermal blanket, gloves and socks, five energy efficient light bulbs and a thermometer. Peter McDonald, co-ordinator with the LCA, said the scheme proved to be a vital measure in keeping those most at risk from the elements safe. Community volunteers in the Triaxtook part in ‘Operation Snowball,’ aimed at helping the elderly community get through the cold snap, helping old people get to the shops as well as Mass as well as salting salt and clearing the footpaths in Creggan Street, Oakfield and several of the steep streets off the Lone Moor Road. Volunteers also cleared pavements in the Top of the Hill and Shantallow areas. The severe cold spell in the run up to Christmas was estimated to have cost the British economy up to pound. billion a day, with a total cost of pound billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly % compared to the same period the previous year. Comments by the chief executive of a major hospitality body in the North echoed those of today. Colin Neill, of Pubs of Ulster, which at the time represented % pf pubs in the North, described the situation for the local industry as critical after trade was badly hit by the harsh weather. Hundreds of s had to be cancelled after snow caused massive disruption. Mr Neill said: “This is probably the worst trading period over Christmas on record for our industry. We normally do % of our years turnover in December and we have people cancelling left, right and centre.” After the freeze came the thaw and within days tens of thousands of people were struggling to cope without water because of burst pipes. About  towns and villages across Northern Ireland were affected and many people had to queue every day to get water for drinking and washing. About , homes and businesses were cut off from the mains water supply during the Christmas period and NI Water was severely criticised for its response to those in need.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Health Minister Robin Swann said:“We have seen an increased uptake in thefluvaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread offlu. “This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities.

Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of theflujab, through participating community pharmacies.” Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering thefluprogramme to date, Minister Swann said:“I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. googletag.cmd.push I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.” The current groups eligible for a freefluvaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers.

Caitlin Kelly, from Bellaghy, decided to take on the run to raise funds for the Magherafelt Adult Centre, where her uncle Gerard attended for over  years until his death last year. The centre provides day care for adults who have been assessed as having a learning disability, and Caitlin said she wanted to show her gratitude. “He loved it and they loved him,” she told Derry Now. “He spent most of his time there and they really looked after him, especially in the latter years, because he developed dementia and had more dficulties than he had previously. googletag.cmd.push  “They couldnt have done enough for him and I wanted to show recognition of that by raising some money for them. They work really hard. “They had so much time for him and we are so grateful he had that to go to every day. Other than seeing his family, he wouldnt really have seen anyone . “Its where he was stimulated and able to learn and develop.” Gerard was one of ten Devlin siblings, and made sure he shared his considerable love equally among them. “He was the centre of everybodys lives. They were just mad about him,” said Caitlin. googletag.cmd.push “There were nine brothers and sisters and he would have gone round each house and made time for everybody. “He was such good craic. During the lockdown, we only got to see him through the window or in gardens, but we were so glad to have him in our lives for so long. “When he turned  in April, during lockdown, we were able to have a wee Zoom birthday party for him.” It was a signicant birthday of her own that prompted Caitlin, whose beauty salon is currently closed due to Covid restrictions, to take on this fundraising challenge. “I turned  on New Years Eve, so I wanted to do a wee fundraiser, especially now because Im off. I thought I could challenge myself and raise money at the same time,” she said.     “Ive been running and walking it. Id planned on running most of it but the roads have been that bad I havent been able to run as much as I liked. “I started running during the first lockdown, back in March. I generally would just go to the gym but this was a challenge for me now to do it. “I love where I live we have such lovely scenery and thank God for the weather as well. Apart from the icy conditions, it hasnt rained, so its helped for seeing the views.” Caitlin has been braving the icy pavements to raise the funds. Since launching the fundraiser, Caitlin has surpassed her initial pound target with ease and has already amassed almost pound, for the Magherafelt Adult Centre. She said the huge generosity was testament not only to how loved her uncle was loved, but to how he himself interacted with others. “The Devlin family are so well known and because its so personal to the Magherafelt Adult Centre as well, people want to help out,” she said. “He was really well known too. He had a big smile for everybody and shook hands with everybody he met.” Caitlin will complete her K with a final run on Sunday, January , and you can donate to her fundraiser by visiting her Go Fund Me page - K for Uncle Gerard .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to .

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old met with City boss Declan Devine last weekend, and it seemed that a move to the Brandywell was on the cards, but he has opted to stay on at Finn Park. The winger appeared  times for Harps last season, scoring two goals. Speaking after the signing, the Kerry man told club media he was keen to repay the faith shown in him by the management team and help the club kick on “I enjoyed my time with Harps last season, there were a great bunch of players with a lot of togetherness in the group. I suppose a lot of us felt we probably underachieved last year with the team we had so hopefully we can manage to kick on again next year. googletag.cmd.push “Ollie and Paul took a chance on me last year and gave me an opportunity to play in the Premier Division again so I owe them a lot. Overall, the players, staff and everyone at the club make you feel very welcome and Im looking forward to pushing on again this year.” Ollie Horgan said: “Karl is a good lad with a lot of talent. He was unlucky with a couple of knocks last year that kept him out of a few games especially towards the end of the season. Hopefully now he can get a good preseason under him and that will set him up well for the year ahead. We’re delighted he’s decided to re-sign with the club.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since his sad passing earlier this week, tributes have overwhelmed the Curran family, as an entire City, and even far beyond pass on kind words and memories of a man who was red and white through and through. googletag.cmd.push A true Brandywell great, Willie stuck with the club during the good and the bad over the years, and being Derry City, it was certainly a rollercoaster ride. His support, as well as his generosity of spirit, never wavered, and as we all remember Willie this week, we can only hope to follow in his example, both in our personal lives and when it comes to supporting our local team – a bastion of loyalty, dedication and honour, Willie will certainly never be forgotten by those who knew him.   Beloved Willie, who celebrated his th birthday only last May, joined the Brandywell club as a -year-old in  and was known throughout the League as a tough-tackling defender who gave everything for his beloved Candystripes. googletag.cmd.push He was part of the City side who won the famous three-game Irish Cup Final against Glentoran in  and was in fact the only Derry born player in the IFA Cup winning side. Willie remained at the Brandywell for another few seasons before signing for Sligo Rovers in . When his playing career ended, Willie continued his association with the Candystripes and stepped into several voluntary roles at the club which he carried on for decades, both in the club’s time in the Irish League and the League of Ireland. His signicance to the local club had been recognised in recent years.     In , he was given a Letime Volunteer Award by the Friends of Derry City FC group for his commitment to the club over so many years. He received the award in front of a packed Brandywell stadium at half-time during a game against St. Patrick’s Athletic, receiving a standing ovation from over , supporters. He also became Derry Citys first-ever Letime Volunteer Award which he received back in . His work as a volunteer was untouched, and Brian Dunleavy, who worked alongside Willie for years, admits he was in awe of the commitment of the man. “Willie was a great man,” he said. “Up to two years ago he was selling half time draw tickets at the Brandywell gate. He’s been selling tickets and prorammes for decades and he has ben involved in every way. There are very few former players who get involved in the operations of the club like that so there was huge respect for Willie. He was just that sort of person. “Up to two or three years ago, Willie was opening those big gates at the Cathedral at half six in the morning. You couldn’t have told him, it didn’t matter how cold or wet it was, you couldn’t have stopped him doing it. He was involved in everything.” Brian is adamant that ticket sales at the club were down in many ways to the popularity of the former centre-half, even well beyond his playing days. “A lot of people were coming in and seeing it was Willie and a lot of people were buying tickets because it was Willie,” he explained. “The number of people who came in and asked for their photographs with him was huge. There was many a person who only bought tickets because it was Willie. When I had them I would sometimes put a couple of extra sellers on the gate, but they were avoiding the others and going straight to Willie. There was no question that it was down to Willie. “He is a one off. He’s definitely a one off. You won’t replace him. He’ll be a huge loss. Since he stopped selling tickets, the ticket sales are away down. People were buying them because of Willie, there’s nothing more sure that that, probably because of who he was and his past involvement as a player. “Older people were coming in with their grandchildren and saying, ‘Get you a photograph with that man there’, and telling them about how good a player he was. It was amazing how many done that, numerous people every game. There were even people who wouldn’t have been regulars and maybe they weren’t from the town but they would come in and see Willie and have to get their photograph with him. A lot of people just thought the sun shone out of him.”   Legacy Willie’s legacy will be one of unwavering support and generosity to his home town team, and those who saw his dedication up close know that no one has affected the club as much as Willie has over the years. “Nobody ever will,” Brian insisted. “Even when he was in poor health, he insisted in standing and doing it. He would never, ever, ever let you or let anybody down. You just won’t see his like again. People will be involved for a long time as players but then their association would end, but not Willie. At , you couldn’t talk him out of selling the tickets. You couldn’t stop him. “At the Barry Molloy Testimonial, because it wasn’t a regular Derry City game and the money still had to be covered, Willie put his hand in his pocket and covered the money for the half time draw. He gave  quid out of his own pocket for that. He was very generous like that, but he was very generous with his time as well. He never turned anybody away for a photograph, he would always have time for people. He was right up there.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I thought this group without doubt deserved more. They are outstanding and deserve a Christmas performance so I went about to make this happen, he explained.ldquoI decided to put on a show for the children as for some of my class this would be their final hurrah in an eagerly anticipated Christmas play with a dference.Mr McGarrity said St Malachyrsquos had previously used green screen technology and he set about organising an ldquoamazing surprise to mash the school play and green screen technology together to make a Christmas show.ldquoThe boys and girls were so excited and overall delighted to be taking part in a somewhat dferent type of production, he said.And with only three weeksrsquo practice before the Christmas holidays they pulled it out of the bag, planning, ing and deliveringlsquoScroogehellipA Ghost of a Chance rsquo, which was screened via YouTube.Mr McGarrity said the link for the recent screening was shared with families, local community groups and care homes as the pupils wanted their story to be heard across the country in a time of need.The primary school teacher said the school was also keen to promote festive cheer and good old Christmas spirit, especially in these unprecedented times, bringing hope and joy to all families. young and old.The St Malachyrsquos production can be viewed at https:youtu.be vsNXbepVw and the school is hoping it will help put a smile on peoplersquos faces..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar is key to future in Down  ","story":"DOWN GAA county secretary Sean Og McAteer has said there potential for ldquoimaginative funding ahead of what is likely to be a very testing year financially at inter-county level.All sporting bodies found their funds hit last year by the spread of covid- and the impact that had.With sport shelved for a large part of the year, and the same happening again in the early part of , it continues to be a trying time.With the virus still posing a signicant threat going into the new year, it is likely that sport at all levels will continue to see many dficulties going forward.Conor Murray, an Irish Research Council Postgraduate scholar at the School of History and Geography at Dublin City University, has been analysing numbers from the GAArsquos annual financial reports from -.He has calculated the levels of grant money given to each county to fund games development and expenses.Whilst at the top end of the scale, Dublinrsquos figure sits at euro. million for the period, for Down the figure is a much more modest euro,, putting them in bottom place.Mr McAteer said Downrsquos expenditure was in no way comparable with that of other counties.ldquoWe are on the low side of the money list, no doubt, he admitted. ldquoWe certainly have the ambition to begin to address the deficit. We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds. Our fishermen can land more fish and we can continue to trade with the Continent relatively unfettered.ldquoThis is particularly important when you consider that most of the prawns we catch locally are exported to Spain.Mr James said the deal has already boosted confidence. ldquoI know of one new boat coming to Ardglass and we are looking at another two, he said.ldquoThe increase in the herring quota secures the future of two herring processing factories in Ardglass and another in Kilkeel.ldquoThis deal guarantees the future of fishing in Ardglass and should encourage more local people to seek employment in the industry.Mr James said it would also add impetus to the campaign for improvements to the harbour in Ardglass.These include deepening the harbour, improving berthing and landing facilities and providing berthing pontoons for smaller vessels..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Calls on public to take coronavirus vaccine  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH man has become one of the first student nurses in the UK to receive the Covid- vaccine.James Savage is now urging local people and fellow health professionals to take up the offer of the potentially le-saving jab as soon as itrsquos made available to them.The  year-old student nurse got his vaccine over the weekend while working part-time as a senior staff member at Ringdufferin Nursing Home near Killyleagh.The former Member of the UK Youth Parliamentfor Strangford, James has recently been elected to the Students Committee of the Royal College of Nursing.He represents the North West region as he attends Liverpool John Moores University where he hopes to qualy in a few years time as a mental health nurse.His call to encourage others to take up the vaccine also comes from his own experience of contacting the virus last March and his sadness over losing his grandmother to Covid- last April, as well as some patients.James, who has worked as a carer in nursing homes since he was , said: ldquoThe vaccine is the best hope for us to overcome challenges currently facing the country.ldquoIrsquove worked in a nursing home during a major outbreak here after which I volunteered as a student nurse to take up a post in the NHS working on the wards helping to care for mental health patients.ldquoDuring my time working in health care and as a student nurse over the last five years, I have had to face many challenges. However, the personal and professional ones I have faced over the last year have been something .I like many in the country have had Covid-, luckily I recovered but like too many, I also lost a beloved family member due to this disease.James received his vaccination at Ringdufferin where he works when he s home for during university breaks. Patients in care homes have been severely affected from Covid- during the pandemic and residents and their staff were chosen by the government to be amongst the first to be vaccinated.He explained: ldquoWhen it came to my attention that I was one of the few student nurses to have received the vaccine at this stage so with my new role as a student ambassador I believed it was important to encourage all student nurses and all NHS workers and of course, all local people, to take up the opportunity to have the vaccine.ldquoThese vaccines are the best chance we have to tackle this pandemic head on. I have personally seen the dedication and strength of our NHS and health care staff across the country.ldquoTheir fortitude and courage have propped up the country in what are indeed dire times. The ability of the nursing profession to overcome adversity is truly great. I am truly thankful for those who cared for my grandmother.James, who often dresses up as Santa Claus at Christmas to brighten up the lives of the care home residents, highlighted the reliability of the vaccine.He said: ldquoThis vaccine has been approved by an independent body here in the UK along with many other countries and has been well tested at every stage.ldquoI have received the vaccine here in Northern Ireland and I feel % confident taking it, having my family take it and encouraging others to take it.ldquoIt will protect our most vulnerable and help our NHS to cope when it is so close to being overwhelmed.

Ellen had a close friendship group of about nine or ten girls who all grew up together and went on holidays together, she said.ldquoWhile the grief hit us all in dferent ways over the years, I was helped dealing with it as I had a lot of friends who were all going through the same thing as we all understood what we were going through.ldquoWe are a tight group of friends and now when we all come together itrsquos not about feeling sad about Ellen, itrsquos about look backing and being happy for her being there.

Ellen, of course, was still going through grief from the loss of her mother. There are people who can get up and get on with things but there are people, such as some of my friends, who did not cope so well, so MYMY provides services for people who are not coping ldquoWhile raising money was not the objective, the real reason was to get people out and about and moving in January as the month is grim enough, but even more so with the tight lockdown.ldquoI wanted it to be something that everybody could take part in, old or young people and you can run one day or walk the next.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, is just one of the local people taking part in the initiative.She said she was delighted to hear of Maireadrsquos challenge in memory of Ellen and her mother.ldquoEveryone locally knows the Finnegans and what a tragedy it was to lose two amazing people from our local community.ldquoThis challenge is great for a number of reasons. It is bringing all walks of le, ages and abilities together at what is already a trying time.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale.

For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth.

We are now allocating extra resources to inspect and where necessary cleanse all highway drainage in areas affected by flooding. There will also be an investigation into the flooding, carried out in partnership with NaturalResources Wales and Dwr Cymru.ldquoTo help support residents affected by flooding, the council provided over  sandbags and around  full-sized builders skips to help dispose of water-damaged furniture, floor coverings and other household items. We also provided regular updates on the situation through social media and the council website.ldquoThe council routinely repairs faulty streetlights, whether they have been damaged by flooding or any other cause.

Itrsquos very uncertain and the I do get the feeling the goodwill is starting to dwindle.Nikki LaceyOn Wednesday it was confirmed that internal assessments replacing next summerrsquos cancelled exams in Wales are scheduled to start in schools on February .Mother-of-three Clare Hollinshead, who has two children at primary school and one in secondary school, also says she felt the decision to extend the closure was the right one.Mrs Hollinshead ndash who is undergoing cancer treatment and is vulnerable ndash says she worried about relying on the actions of others to keep her family safe.Clare HollinsheadldquoI think the decisionhad to be made, but I do have concerns for my children, she said.ldquoThe impact on them not seeing their friends and not getting the education they deserve is something them makes me anxious.ldquoToo much time alone and in front of a screen is no good for anyone.ldquoIt will be more concerningit continues after January . Itrsquos dficult to maintain that motivation to keep going and keep balancing le with home-schooling.ldquoButitrsquos what we have to do then so be it. Itrsquos so important we protect the NHS. Irsquod hate for someone who was in my positionto not get the treatment they need because our hospitals are overwhelmed.On Tuesday Ms Williams said schools will only remain closed after January  ldquo thatrsquos the only thing we can do to suppress the virus.ldquoClearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face teaching contact for the majority of children is a really dficult decision, she said, ldquoand itrsquos a decision which has grave consequences for children.ldquoEducation has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope, and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
