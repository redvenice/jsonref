They are not directly linked to the Russian government and therefore they are plausibly deniable.\u0027Sources said the militia were briefed about Putin\u0027s plans against Ukraine back in December, long before the Russian army was told. Boris Johnson today urged NATO to act \u0027harder\u0027 against Russia to end the war \u0027faster\u0027 as he unveiled a wave of new sanctions - which include the Wagner Group.  The Wagner Group are among the targets in the latest set of measures, announced as the PM arrived in Brussels for talks with the military alliance.There are claims the notorious mercenaries have been tasked with assassinating Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians.The new sanctions cover iniduals including billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov, Herman Gref, and Polina Kovaleva, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u0027s alleged stepdaughter.Galina Danilchenko, installed by Russia as the \u0027mayor\u0027 of Melitopol has also become the first person sanctioned for \u0027collaboration with Russian forces\u0027 in Ukraine.Six more banks have also been sanctioned, according to the Foreign Office.As he arrived in Brussels, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We\u0027ve got to step up.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph: Sally HaydenThey cast three people in each role, on the assumption that two would drop out before the final performance, and rehearsed most nights on an old basketball court in a girls’ secondary school, without overhead lights. For the University of Sierra Leone Theatre Group, the show would go on.“Can’t miss this play redefining the views about gender, sexual orientation and power in Africa, ” read the advertisement for The Throne, which was performed for the first time to hundreds of people at Freetown’s City Hall in February and promoted as the “rebirth of theatre in Sierra Leone”.Some said it was the first live theatre performance in decades. A cast of about 30 rehearsed for months, contributing some of their own money to buy costumes and construct the set, and the final show included dancing, singing and drumming.It was sold out, leading to a second performance. Now, the cast is going on the road for a third, in the city of Makeni, in the west African coastal country’s north.“It is a big deal,” says Sarafina Nicolsesay, a 22-year-old mass communication graduate and the play’s narrator. “I think the culture has died for a long time . . . In Sierra Leone one of the struggles that we’ve had with marketing this event is most people are not interested in theatre.”Nicolsesay fell in love with acting as a child, listening to satirical radio programmes, and later began to watch shows such as Hamilton on YouTube. To join the theatre group, she had to ignore criticism from her mother, who saw acting as a waste of time because it wouldn’t earn her decent money. Staying involved has been an uphill battle.Many of the cast and crew were born during or since Sierra Leone’s civil war, which devastated the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. It again suffered through the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic. Local cultural activities – particularly theatre – have been a casualty, those involved in The Throne say, as many Sierra Leoneans haven’t learned to value them.Nicolsesay doesn’t know of a single functional theatre in her home country, but she hopes an industry can begin to develop. “Entertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,” she says, with clear enthusiasm.The plot of The Throne, written by Sierra Leonean writer Oumar Farouk Sesay, follows the demise of the king of the village of Norkorba. The only two people in the line of succession are his son – a married gay man who lives in the diaspora – or his daughter, who, as a woman, challenges the patriarchal structures that prop up the monarchy.“It’s going to be a culture shock to a lot of people, especially the part about the gay characters,” Nicolsesay says in advance of the opening performance. “The first time I heard the synopsis of it, I was like, Are you sure this is going to be cool, because we don’t have people who are out and proud in this country,” she says. “But that’s what we’re trying to show . . . you’re trying to get people to understand a certain type of subject that is taboo.”Homosexuality between men is illegal in Sierra Leone, and can, in theory, be punished with life imprisonment, though this has not been recently enforced.Nicolsesay says she hopes the play will start a conversation about feminism as well. “Women are always trying to go for leadership roles and they’ve been shut down, they’re always demoralised, and so that’s something that unfolds in the play as well.” Both topics are “pushing the boundaries”, she says.From October 2021, the young people rehearsed almost every night, passionate both about the story and the talent they wanted to display. “If it gets dark it doesn’t matter, we use our phone lights,” says Alvin Momoh, sitting on a bench at dusk, as he watches a full run-through. The fashion designer, who also works on a Sierra Leonean TV show called Slay Or Nay, helped organise the costumes. “Sometimes we stay late into the night.”Speaking after the first two performances, the play’s director, Bilal Jalloh, says there has been no negative reaction. “They love what we did,” he says, though “some people choose to reserve their opinions” on the plot.Martin Simah Jnr (23), who played the king’s gay son, says he did not invite friends and family to attend the initial performances because he was worried about their reaction. But he had his own revelation, finding the experience “wowing”. Performing the role helped him to understand both the discrimination same-sex couples face, as well as the “relevance of women in the political arena”, he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"democratic systems pitted against authoritarian rule as western leaders gather","story":"US president Joe Biden  being welcomed by European Council president Charles Michel at the start of European Council summit in Brussels. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPA“Russia is capable of anything.” Those were the ominous words of Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin to journalists in Brussels as Nato, the G7, and the EU gathered to forge a unified international response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It highlighted an imbalance between the Russia and the West in their ability to act.\u0026nbspThe response of western countries is a story of constraints. Germany has ruled out stopping buying gas from Russia because it would damage its economy. The EU is constrained by what its 27 members can agree to. The bloc’s foundation is based upon internationally agreeing standards and laws. By their nature, democratic governments are constrained by what their electorates will support.“It’s all well and good to talk about stopping it,” a diplomat said this week when asked about whether the fossil fuel supply from Russia should be cut.\u0026nbsp“But if in Ireland, in Belgium, you’re told electricity is rationed and you have to queue up to fill your car, you only have enough electricity for a few hours – how long will solidarity with Ukraine last?”A defining constraint is the western commitment not to escalate, particularly given that it is up to Russia to define what escalation entails.This is why Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s calls for Nato to impose a so-called no-fly zone over Ukraine have been refused. The call – to deny Russian aircraft the use of the skies, to remove Moscow’s crucial military advantage over Ukraine and its ability to bomb its cities – has been taken up by Ukrainian people, in protests all around the world, and “close the sky now” was the chant of a large protest that gathered outside EU buildings as leaders met.Zelenskiy addressZelenskiy has called for it since the invasion was launched on February 24th, he recalled in a video address to Nato leaders on Thursday.“The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help,” he told them. “To save our people and our cities Ukraine needs military assistance – without restrictions.”Shortly afterwards, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte explained why the request could not be granted.“What he obviously also wants is a no-fly zone. But that would bring the West, through our fighter jets, in a one-on-one direct confrontation with Russia,” Rutte told journalists.\u0026nbsp“Whilst we need to do everything to support Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his courageous team and his soliders, at the same time we also have to protect the world from an escalation that might take a form that we all don’t want.”In contrast, Vladimir Putin has organised his regime so that he has no constraints. He has destroyed any rivals to his power, crushed or co-opted systems of accountability, and created a controlled media environment to prevent even people even knowing about what he does.On his arrival at the EU summit, US president Joe Biden told press that Putin’s aim was precisely to exploit exactly this difference.“His overall main objective is to demonstrate that democracies cannot function in the 21st century, because things are moving so rapidly, they require consensus, and it’s too difficult to get consensus, and autocracies are going to rule,” Biden said. He noted that the number of democracies worldwide has fallen in the last 10 years.Sudden collapseBut while authoritarian regimes can be nimble, this same feature also makes them liable to sudden collapse.As they accumulate power, strongmen cause their own fragililty, by shutting out correcting voices that would save them from making mistakes.The distillation of power at the top in Russia is such that even senior figures within the regime are said to have been caught off guard by Putin’s decision to unleash the invasion. Soldiers, too.It’s something that may have contributed to ill-preparedness in the Russian army. For the first time, Nato this week began to acknowledge that Russian losses may be as profound as the Ukrainian government has been claiming.A senior Nato military official estimated that Russia had lost 7,000 to 15,000 soldiers already in its invasion. It’s a vast estimate, and would represent a disaster for Moscow: by comparison, Russia lost 15,000 troops in a decade of war in Afghanistan. Several European countries are now scrambling to get more military aid to Ukraine to allow it to maintain its resistance. It’s a rush because no one had prepared for this, never expecting the Kyiv government would still be standing against such a larger adversary one month on.“What we have to do is continue supporting the Ukrainian army,” EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell told journalists as he entered the summit. “The next two weeks will decide on which side victory comes.”Full coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"europe facing long haul over russian invasion says taoiseach","story":"Taoiseach Michael Martin: ‘There can be no moral equivalence around this war. Certain countries need to get off the fence on that.’  Photograph: PA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said that Europe must prepare for the “long haul” in opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, declaring that Ireland was “open to more sanctions” on Russia. “This is a long haul,” Mr Martin said on his way into the EU summit in Brussels, where leaders discussed further responses to the invasion with US president Joe Biden. “We’re very clear on this in terms of the impact of this war both from a humanitarian perspective but also from an economic one, and particularly energy.” He said that EU leaders would seek to prepare for an energy crunch next winter, anticipating that sanctions against Russia would remain and may well be tougher by then. He said that EU leaders would “be looking at the energy security and energy supply issue for the autumn”. The summit got under way on Thursday afternoon and continued into the night. The leaders will resume discussions on Friday morning.Describing the attack on Ukraine as a “barbaric war”, Mr Martin said that it was “very clear” that Vladimir Putin “is targeting civilians and the people of Ukraine”.Asked about new sanctions, Mr Martin said: “We need the widest and strongest set of sanctions we possibly can provide to keep the pressure on Putin’s regime. But obviously there are implications for other states in respect of energy.“Ireland is open to more sanctions,” he said, “but also to make sure that we enforce the sanctions that have been put in place.” UnacceptableMr Martin criticised India, saying the position taken by the country is “unacceptable, quite frankly”. India has sought to facilitate ways to work around sanctions on Russia, including by using currency swaps to enable Russian trade.“There can be no moral equivalence around this war,” he said. “Certain countries need to get off the fence on that.” He said he would communicate this to the Indian government. Asked if Ireland would commit to closer military co-operation with the EU, Mr Martin said that Ireland would support the “strategic compass”, an EU plan for a strengthening of the bloc’s security and defence policy over the next decade, due to be approved by the leaders at the summit.He said that it was “an evolution of security and defence policy within the European Union”. He said Ireland had participated in EU battlegroups and in peacekeeping and peace-enforcement missions. The EU’s plan “respected our military neutrality”, but added that “it makes sense that we would have a common approach to cyber-security, hybrid threats, it makes sense that there would be interoperability between difference defence forces in the European Union. We’ve already signed up for that.“This is an evolution of policy,” he said.Earlier Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, who travelled to Brussels for a meeting of EPP leaders on the margins of the summit, said that funds donated by Ireland were being used to buy supplies for the Ukrainian army, including “fuel and rations and body armour”. “They mightn’t be weapons but they do make a difference. You know an army marches on its stomach and they need armour and they need fuel and we’re providing that.” TechnicalityAsked if this was military assistance, Mr Varadkar said: “Technically it’s not. It’s considered to be non-lethal assistance . . . But to me it is largely a technicality.”On possible reductions in VAT on fuel, Mr Martin said there was “a bit more work to be done” on reaching agreement with the European Commission. He said that Ireland was on “lower levels of VAT on fuel” than other countries because of an “historic derogation”. However, he said that the Government would pursue technical discussions with the European Commission which could enable the Government to pause the derogation and restore it at a later date.

Photograph: Stephanie LecocqFour months ago Washington was locked in a war of words with Warsaw, warning of “serious ramifications” if a new law was enacted to ban foreign media ownership in Poland.The law – which would have forced the US Discovery channel to sell its $1 billion TVN news operation in Poland – was vetoed at the last minute by President Andrzej Duda.On Friday morning, with an actual war on Poland’s eastern border, Duda will welcome US president Joe Biden to the Polish capital on a high-stakes visit.After meeting on Thursday in Brussels, Duda plans to press his US visitor in Warsaw about the “security, including Poland’s security, the humanitarian crisis” building on its borders.Since February 24th, about 2.2 million people have crossed from Ukraine into Poland, according to official figures released on Thursday, with 30,000 alone arriving on Wednesday, down from 31,000 a day earlier.“This visit proves Poland’s importance in Nato and the region,” said Duda.The Biden administration knows the symbolic value of standing with Poland as a valued strategic and humanitarian ally.\u0026nbspThough US officials have dismissed a trip into Ukraine as too risky, speculation is growing that the president, on his third foreign trip, will deliver a major address in Poland – possibly even in the border region.Catastrophic betrayals The US leader will need to work overtime to reassure jittery Poles of the value of Nato membership, in particular its mutual defence clause.\u0026nbspAfter a long and tragic history of catastrophic betrayals by its neighbours, Poles need to hear – again and again – that they will not be left to face Russia alone.On Thursday, Nato announced plans to bolster its battle group presence along its eastern wall, from Hungary to Romania.\u0026nbspThis follows additional deterrent troops recently deployed in Poland up to the Baltic countries. But Warsaw wants more: a “permanent, defensive presence” on its eastern flank and a “Nato peacekeeping force” in Ukraine.Western Nato members view these ideas as unwise and potential provocations for Moscow.But Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, seeing their nightmare scenario unfolding in Ukraine, are on a mission to “wake up the West” on Vladimir Putin.“A year or two from now . . . he will go for Helsinki, Vilnius, Warsaw, Bucharest, maybe Berlin, too,” said Mateusz Morawiecki, Polish prime minister, in Brussels on Thursday.Biden’s visit comes amid growing tensions between Russia and Poland. On Thursday, the Russian ambassador in Warsaw complained that his embassy bank accounts had been blocked.Morawiecki confirmed his government had acted against the embassy, which he accused of financing “terrorist activity”.Killing the innocent“Russia is terrorising Ukraine, terrorising the civilian population, killing innocent women, children and the elderly,” he said.On Wednesday, Poland announced the expulsion of 45 Russian diplomats, their spouses and other embassy staff for carrying out “de facto intelligence work” from the diplomatic complex.Interior minister Mariusz Kaminski also last week announced the arrest of a Polish civil servant, accused of being a Russian spy.\u0026nbspA political row is growing in Warsaw, too, over government plans to expropriate Russian-owned property in Poland.On some issues, Warsaw is far closer to Washington than many of its western European neighbours, in particular demanding greater “economic combat” with Moscow by dropping Russian energy.Last week, Poland announced it would be free of Russian gas by September, with a new Baltic pipeline carrying Norwegian gas via Denmark supplementing an existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Baltic coast for deliveries from Qatar and the US.Biden’s looming visit has triggered feverish speculation over whether the president will address in public long-running concerns, shared by Washington and western EU capitals, over the rule of law in Poland.Since taking office in 2015, the PiS administration has enacted what it says are overdue reforms of courts and other public bodies, which critics say have undermined their political independence.“The government is worried he will mention this, critics are worried he won’t,” said Eugeniusz Smolar, a Polish foreign policy analyst. “The signs at the moment are that Biden will take a first-things-first approach, that the priority now is Russia and not the rule of law.”Full coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"after six long toxic years a civilised debate about eu and brexit","story":"Former French president Francois Mitterrand and former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: Ken Clarke suggested one reason Helmut Kohl and Mitterrand patronised Thatcher and failed to take her seriously was because she was a woman.

Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West will respond \u0026#39in kind\u0026#39 if Moscow uses chemical weapons, warns Joe BidenAnoosheh Ashoori accuses Boris Johnson of opportunism after meeting request: \u0026#39Why now?\u0026#39The Queen conducts ‘factory tour’ ... from her own drawing roomUK to double its troops in Eastern Europe as Nato strengthens defencesJoe Biden: We will respond in kind if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in UkraineWe had to eat a stray dog, admit people forced into fight for survival by Russia’s ‘Butcher of Mariupol’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain could become tidal energy superpower","story":"Tidal electricity generation is among the ideas listed by Boris Johnson as a way of avoiding reliance on Putin’s Russia. It is an even stronger candidate than he might have realised, holding out the promise not only of increasing our energy independence but also levelling up. A group of scientists and engineers has shown how we could generate electricity using tidal energy that does not require the building of a costly lagoon, like the cancelled scheme for Swansea Bay.Schemes based on using tidal river basins would increase energy security, reduce reliance on authoritarian dictatorships, increase levelling up, and (unlike other renewables) require no government subsidy. Moreover, unlike wind and solar, there is no intermittency problem and electricity is generated round the clock every day of the year.A considerable amount of electricity could be generated on derelict, brownfield sites that lie adjacent to the major industrial rivers in the UK. They are former shipyards, chemical works, salt pans, wharves and ironworks that have been abandoned.In essence the plan involves taking over a derelict riverside site, near the sea (to use the full tidal range) but far enough inland to avoid sea storms. A simple concrete and steel construction, like a dry dock, is all that’s required. Turbines work between the river and the excavated basin, which is subided into chambers with turbines in the iding walls. When the tide comes in, through the turbines, it makes electricity and when it goes out, it also passes through turbines to make electricity. Some water is held back in the chambers to keep generating while the tide is turning.Housing could be built on the roof of the basin and sold to help recover capital costs. The sites could also be used as a base for frozen food factories. The frozen food industry is a very heavy user of electricity but siting a large operating plant over a tidal basin would enable the turnover of cold tidal water to act as the cooling reservoir and take a considerable load off the grid.An even heavier user of electricity is the data storage industry. The amount of power used to cool enormous memory banks is huge. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, as well as the NHS, are all concerned about the cost of keeping vast computer facilities cool. This burden could be taken off the grid by transferring it to the cold water circulating in the tidal basin. Green hydrogen could also be manufactured by electrolysis using on-site electricity when not required by the national grid.About 40 potential sites have been identified. The most promising are on the Tyne (former dry docks), at the Forth (former salt pans), the Tees (former ICI works), the Orwell (another former ICI site), and Swansea (a former BP chemical works and a former steelworks). Each would be capable of generating around 400MW.The opportunity for inward investment is huge and no government subsidy is required, unlike schemes for large-scale nuclear plants. Reliable income streams would come from selling the electricity, using the water for cooling, and selling green hydrogen.If we want both energy independence and levelling-up, then generating electricity in tidal river basins looks like the next big idea.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West will respond \u0026#39in kind\u0026#39 if Moscow uses chemical weapons, warns Joe BidenAnoosheh Ashoori accuses Boris Johnson of opportunism after meeting request: \u0026#39Why now?\u0026#39The Queen conducts ‘factory tour’ ... from her own drawing roomUK to double its troops in Eastern Europe as Nato strengthens defencesJoe Biden: We will respond in kind if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in UkraineWe had to eat a stray dog, admit people forced into fight for survival by Russia’s ‘Butcher of Mariupol’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rustat verdict humiliation woke activists","story":"Representatives of Jesus College, Cambridge, have declared themselves “shocked” at the verdict that, despite the strident demands of campaigners, Grinling Gibbons’s monument to Tobias Rustat should remain in the college chapel.What is truly shocking is the sheer certainty of these campaigners that the judgment of the Consistory Court of the Diocese of Ely, tasked with deciding the monument’s future, would go their way. It is of a part with the arrogant attitude of activists across the country, who have closed their ears to intelligent debate about how we commemorate notable people from the past whose social and political assumptions were very different from our own.It turns too on a distorted view of the past: one that is rooted in the assumption that modern British society is deeply and ineradicably impregnated with the legacy of the slave trade. What the judge in the Rustat case, Deputy Chancellor David Hodge, rightly called the “evil, utterly abhorrent, and repugnant” slave trade did have a role in the making of Britain. But to afford it such exclusive predominance is to ignore all the other ways in which Britain enriched itself over the centuries. No better example of this distortion can be found than the row over Rustat, who, it has now been shown, made his many benefactions with money obtained elsewhere than the slave trade.Some quiet victories have been obtained in recent months by those who oppose the new iconoclasm championed in universities and museums. Imperial College, for instance, has agreed not to remove the name of Thomas Huxley, one of the college’s founders. But it is the Rustat judgment which provides the firmest indication yet that the tide has finally turned. It is a landmark decision in the resolution of our current disputes. We must now hope that rational thinking is returning to British institutions just as the public grows exasperated by increasingly absurd claims about historical figures.Deputy Chancellor Hodge had harsh words for those who jumped to conclusions about Rustat, enlarging his role in slavery out of all proportion, making it out to be the main source of his wealth, though it was not. Sloppy research about links between colleges and slavery is unacceptable in one of the world’s leading universities. In Jesus, as in other great educational establishments, the absurd generalisations of “Critical Race Theory” have been allowed to guide debate about events and behaviour several centuries ago. In one email a student even complained of “a concerted effort by external white supremacist organisations” to retain the Rustat monument.The judgment also makes powerful positive points about the religious setting for the monument: a church or chapel belongs not to humans but to God, and “the Rustat memorial may be employed as an appropriate vehicle to consider the imperfection of human beings … Forgiveness encompasses the whole of humankind, past and present, for we are all sinners and it extends even to slave traders.”Nor should we forget the words of the Rustat monument itself: “The greatest part of the Estate he gathered … he disposed in his life time in works of charity.” Such a man, whose bones lie under the floor of his beloved chapel, deserves more than to be reduced to a cardboard caricature.David Abulafia is a professor of history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West will respond \u0026#39in kind\u0026#39 if Moscow uses chemical weapons, warns Joe BidenAnoosheh Ashoori accuses Boris Johnson of opportunism after meeting request: \u0026#39Why now?\u0026#39The Queen conducts ‘factory tour’ ... from her own drawing roomUK to double its troops in Eastern Europe as Nato strengthens defencesJoe Biden: We will respond in kind if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in UkraineWe had to eat a stray dog, admit people forced into fight for survival by Russia’s ‘Butcher of Mariupol’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"embarrassing moment rishi sunak struggles","story":"Embarrassing moment Rishi Sunak struggles to use bank card while buying petrolThe embarrassing moment was aired on Sky News last night after Rishi Sunak delivered his mini budget to the House of Commonsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video rishi-sunak-appears-struggle-paying-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:aBJPmHrR,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Mr Sunak raises his bank card to try and pay using the barcode scanner through the plastic screen not realising it isnapost a card machine.The gaffe was aired on Sky News last night as it emerged that the Chancellor had posed for pictures promoting the Treasuryaposs temporary fuel duty cut using someone aposs car. The millionaire Chancellor arranged a photo opportunity at a Sainsburyaposs forecourt filling up a Kia Rio - worth about £, - and paying for the petrol himself. The Cabinet minister, who had a small mic clipped to his tie for the publicity shots, was roundly mocked on social media as pretending to be a man of the people while Brits brace for the biggest fall in living standards since records began in the s.  And it is now understood that the family car he was filling up did not even belong to the Cabinet minister and was that of a Sainsburyaposs worker. It comes after Mr Sunak delivered his Spring Statement to the House of Commons as millions of Brits struggle with the cost of living crisis. Yesterday, Mr Sunak confirmed a p-a-litre cut to fuel duty as part of his Spring Statement.Experts have called for more action from the Chancellor after petrol prices hit record highs. The cut in fuel duty means the rate will be reduced to .p for both petrol and diesel from pm yesterday until March next year. The current rate is .p per litre. Fuel duty is included in the price drivers pay at the pumps, with VAT at % charged on top of the total price. The Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier.  Motoring experts at the RAC suggest the cut to fuel duty will save drivers just £ off the cost of filling a -litre family car.Yesterday, Mr Sunak boasted he was unveiling £.bn of help to support Brits with the biggest cost of living crisis since records began in the s. .milion Brits including half a million children will be dragged below the poverty line despite Rishi Sunak‘s Spring Statement, devastating analysis says.

Their benefits will rise by just .% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by %.”The Chancellor announced cuts to National Insurance. He also promised to cut income tax from p to p in the pound in April , just in time for a general election. But there was almost no help for those out of work, and nothing to improve the level of benefits.

The telegenic Chancellor was praised for the generosity of the furlough scheme and his slick performances at the Covid press conferences. Sunak is now discovering that popularity can be as superficial as the images on his Instagram account. His Spring Statement did not just land badly, it belly-flopped. There was nothing extra to help people with the cost of living, an additional .million people will be dragged into poverty and workers are going to be hit with higher taxes. Those who had shares in Sunak are now trying to offload them before then reach the status of a Russian rouble. The fall in Sunak’s stock seems to have happened overnight. But the Chancellor’s downfall has been in the making ever since he stepped into Number . He was presented by his slick PR machine as a slightly nerdy guy who wears a hoodie to work, has a nice haircut and wouldn’t offend your motheryou brought him round to dinner.  He was a safe pair of hands whose grasp of detail and measured manner offered a reassuring contrast to the bumbling, chaotic style of Boris Johnson. That’s what made him an appealing prospect for many voters - especially moderate conservatives - as a potential future leader. But beneath the soft-speaking and cosy leisurewear was a Thatcherite Tory, whose privileged upbringing, private education and vast family wealth has apparently left him struggling to understand the real world.For example, the Government was today forced to admit the Chancellor had borrowed a Kia Rio from a Sainsbury’s garage employee for a staged photo of him filling up with petrol with a broad grin. Downing Street said he paid for the petrol himself. In an interview yesterday morning, Mr Sunak said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all dferent breads in my house.” The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  And the same day, footage emerged of Mr Sunak apparently struggling to pay for a tiny can of Coca-Cola in a shop, because he kept trying to tap his contactless card on the bar code reader. He once in an interview described himself as a “massive Coke addict” - which he quickly claried, meant the drink. But he also revealed he was a cola snob, and prefers the formula only available by importing bottles from Mexico. He won’t touch the Diet or Zero ieties. Evidence of his expensive tastes doesn’t end there.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March  saw him pose up with a £ bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £ a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s.  In pictures released before his  budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £ designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in  that he starts the day with a ride on his £, Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby.  In December , just days after freezing public sector pay for millions of workers, the Mirror revealed he had dined with his we, Akshata Murthy, at Mayfairaposs  Hertford Street - known as Londonaposs most secretive private membersapos club. The Mirror understands Mrs Murthy - whose vast wealth reportedly puts her higher up the rich list than the Queen - planned to hold a surprise party for Mr Sunak’s th birthday at the same private club in , but Covid- restrictions got in the way. Mrs Murthy’s business interests came under the spotlight today amid questions about whether Mr Sunak’s family had benefited from interests in Russia.  Mr Sunak was forced to deny profiting from Vladimir Putin’s regime, after being asked about Mrs Murthy’s reported stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father N.R. Narayana Murthy. Just last week, Mr Sunak warned businesses to “think carefully” about making investments in Russia. But unlike other ministers, Mr Sunak has resisted calls to declare his we’s shareholdings on the Register of Members’ Interests. He insists he “followed the ministerial code to the letter.”  And Mr Sunak’s decision making was called into question long before his failure to deliver help for working families in Wednesday’s mini-Budget. Analysis found his “Eat Out to Help Out” campaign failed to deliver a long-term boost to struggling restaurants and cafes, knocked sideways by the pandemic. Studies did suggest, however, that it helped to push up infections - with the scheme linked to a spike of between  and %.

Ministers attended eight meetings with testing firm Randox - twice as many as previously disclosed - but kept minutes for just two, according to the National Audit Office’s investigation. The firm and its strategic partner Qnostics Ltd were handed £. million with of contracts - % of which were awarded without competition under emergency procurement rules. The firm had former Tory MP Owen Paterson on their payroll as a consultant.And documents released last month revealed he had personally lobbied then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the firm - and asking him to kill news stories making claims about his involvement with the initial £m deal.Before the NAO’s report today, the government had admitted to four ministerial meetings with Randox since the start of the pandemic.  But the NAO identied a further four where the Department of Health and Social Carehad failed to record Randox’s attendance on official transparency releases. They also found documents which “indicated” one-to-one telephone calls between ministers - including Mr Hancock and former le sciences minister Lord Bethell - and representatives of Randox, including Mr Paterson.  DHSC could not confirm to the NAO whether the calls took place, or any notes from the discussions. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: Even taking these exceptional circumstances into account, the documentation of the decision-making process for such large contracts was inadequate.”  Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee added: Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: “Far from vindicating ministers from the Randox scandal, this damning report lays bare the sleaze and cover up running re at the heart of this Conservative Government. “This report shows that Steve Barclay, now No Chief of Staff, misled Parliament over the Randox papers, claiming that the NAO had access to documents when they did not. He must urgently come to Parliament and correct the record. “Ministers also breached their own transparency rules multiple times and failed to identy potential conflicts of interest relating to the first Randox contract. Had this work been done, the dodgy links between Owen Paterson, Tory ministers and Randox could have been identied at an early stage, protecting taxpayersapos money. While the body found no evidence contracts were handed out improperly, the gaps in records meant they were not able to provide positive assurance in the normal way.” The report read: “This report should not be considered as offering positive assurance over any of these contracts which are not detailed in the report or as offering any legal opinion on the use of public procurement regulations.” Despite this, Mr Hancock claimed the report had given ministers a “clean bill of health”, adding “the report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing.”The report noted Mr Hancock had used private email and WhatsApp to discuss Randox with Mr Paterson.He did not disclose all the messages to DHSC officials at the time, telling investigators he did not believe they were “substantive” discussions, and he was not required to do so under Cabinet Office rules. He later made his phone available to investigators and to the department.The report also notes the Information Commissioner is investigating the use of private correspondence channels at DHSC, but has yet to publish its report. DHSC was “unable to provide” key evidence to investigators about decision making - and because notes were not recorded in the department’s existing systems, they had to search several officials’ email accounts to find it. “The Department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other signicant aspects of the procurement,” the report reads. “Including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contact award, and considering of potential conflicts of interest.” Records seen by the NAO suggest officials did not think conflicts of interest rules applied to emergency direct awards. “This reflects an incorrect understanding of the relevant regulations,” the report reads. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: “Mr Hancock warmly welcomes this thorough report by the NAO, which confirms a total clean bill of health on Ministers’ work with Randox during the pandemic. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing - just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity. While the department will no doubt reflect on the technical issues that need to be addressed, the report sets out that Ministers and Officials in the Department were doing their very best to save lives in what was a quick moving and unprecedented situation. Mr Hancockaposs thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones.  Ms Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat. “Over % of testing contracts were awarded to ‘high priority’ companies, including those referred by ministers, MPs or Number . The public needs to trust that their taxes are spent on the basis that it’s what you know, not who you know. “As with many of the COVID response schemes, lessons must be learned about delivering at speed.” A spokesperson for Randox said: “We welcome the finding of the NAO report that there is no evidence of any impropriety in the awarding of government contracts to Randox. “This independent finding vindicates what both Randox and the Government have always said, that these contracts were awarded on merit and in keeping with government protocols and regulations at a time of acute national emergency. “During the pandemic, Randox delivered more than  million gold standard PCR tests, becoming the first laboratory in the world to process more than , tests daily. “In doing so, Randox played its part in helping save tens of thousands of lives, keeping vital sectors of the economy open and enabling essential overseas family and business travel. “The report states that four ministerial meetings took place which were, apparently, not fully documented by the DHSC. “While we cannot comment on government minuting of meetings, Randox can categorically state that the awarding of contracts was not on the agenda at any of these meetings.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppNational Audit OfficeLord BethellGareth DaviesOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonMeg HillierPoliticsSolar powerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The highest inflation in  years and the worst income squeeze on record lie ahead of us.While household finances are taking a hammering, the public finances have actually been on the up: we’re all paying more taxes than the Government expected. Using that headroom, the Chancellor today prioritised rebuilding his tax cutting credentials over support for the low-to-middle income households hardest hit. A p cut to fuel duty will save the typical driving households £ a year, but only reverse  per cent of the increase in pump prices over the past year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section An increase in how much you can earn before you start paying National Insurance will be welcome relief for many, but middle and top income households will gain the most. In fact only £ in every £ of new support goes to the poorer half of families. Giving councils £m to provide emergency support to people struggling just isn’t enough when benefits will fall £bn next year in real terms. Absolute poverty will rise.

Tax receipts as a share of the economy are set to reach their highest level since - – we’re talking the equivalent of a £, rise per household since the  election. Today the Chancellor announced a bigger policy package than expected, but it was badly designed. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually.

Families are facing a devastating a cost of living crisis. And the Chancellor could have helped them out, by scrapping his tax rise on jobs.He could have introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household energy bills. He could have finally brought forward a plan to support British business and create good jobs. That’s what a Labour Government would have delivered. But instead, years of Tory tax rises means that after today the OBR say that we will still have the highest tax burden in  years. Not only that, April will now bring the biggest fall in family incomes since records began.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Even with the Chancellor’s cynical changes, he’s only shaving £ off every £ he’s taxing people. This simply isn’t going to cut it as inflation spirals out of control. Britain’s people needs a government on their side. Instead, we have one that wants to raise taxes and leave working people paying the price. Come April, a landlord with a large number of properties or someone who makes huge sums from buying and selling stocks and shares won’t be paying any more in tax, but their tenants will.

It is meant to provide “organic airborne surveillance and control capability”.  The other is the £.bn Armoured Cavalry programme for  Ajax fighting vehicles. Just  have been delivered and they have given troops hearing problems. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “As NATO leaders meet to respond to Russian aggression, ministers are failing to equip our armed forces with the full kit and equipment to fight and fulfil our NATO obligations.“The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department with no major programme set for delivery on time and on budget, while at least £bn has also been wasted in taxpayers’ money since .“On day one, Labour in government would get the NAO to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value of Money’s tough regime on spending decisions.” Projects in the NAO’s -page “Departmental Overview of the Ministry of Defence”, published last month, have come under fresh scrutiny amid Russia ’s war with Ukraine.Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has triggered tomorrowaposs emergency summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where the Prime Minister is expected to welcome new defence spending pledges by allies - and urge counterparts to go further in supporting Kyiv.But details uncovered by Labour reveal the extent to which Mr Johnson should be worried about defence procurement at home. Multibillion-pound deals are rated in one of five colour-coded categories.  According to Whitehall’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority, green means “successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery signicantly”. But that does not apply to any of the MoD’s schemes. Twelve are given the amber red rating, meaning “successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. “Urgent action is needed to address these problems and or assess whether resolution is feasible.” Fourteen are rated amber, meaning “successful delivery appears feasible but signicant issues already exist, requiring management attention. “These appear resolvable at this stage and,addressed promptly, should not present a cost schedule overrun.” An MoD spokesman said: “Our latest available figures show the majority of MoD’s major projects are capable of being delivered on time and in budget. “We are making the largest investment in our armed forces since the end of the Cold War, with an additional £bn helping ensure they have the equipment they need to meet future threats.” It is understood the most up-to-date figures show % of the MoD’s Government Major Projects Portfolio are rated as amber or better, with problems that,addressed promptly, should not trigger extra costs or delays.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

He didn’t treat you very well\"Boris Johnson and Joe Biden in the NATO summit earlier today Image: REUTERSByBen Glaze, Deputy Political Editor, in Brussels:,  Mar |comments World leaders laughed as Joe Biden took a swipe at Donald Trump ’s expense today.The US President poked fun at his predecessor as he attended an emergency NATO summit in Brussels. During his four years in the White House, Mr Trump branded the military alliance “obsolete” and berated allies for failing to spend enough on defence. Addressing NATO leaders in a behind-closed-doors session, Mr Biden backed the previous incumbent’s stance on member countries pumping more cash into their armed forces. But he added: “Please don’t mistake me for my predecessor. He didn’t treat you very well.” A Western official said: “That got a round of laughter in the room.” It came after the alliance agreed to step up measures to protect Ukraine and members of the -country alliance from a Russian chemical or nuclear attack.Secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: Today we agreed to do more including cyber-security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. Mr Stoltenberg said Natoaposs chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements had been activated and we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves.Asked whether the move was based on credible intelligence, Mr Stoltenberg said: We are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext - accusing Ukraine, the United States, Nato allies - for preparing to use chemical and biological weapons.Earlier Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky urged NATO chiefs to send tanks and warplanes to his war-torn country so forces can repel Russian invaders.  In a passionate video link plea to an emergency summit at the coalition’s headquarters, he warned leaders from the organisation’s  member countries that delays to vital equipment were costing lives. He fumed: “You have thousands of fighter jets but we havenapost been given any yet. “We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others - cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and articially creating famine no water, no food, nothing there. “You have at least , tanks Ukraine asked for a percent - one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us - but we do not have a clear answer yet. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Despite military strategists saying that Kremin warplanes have failed to gain air superiority, Mr Zelensky said “their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction”. He told NATO leaders including Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson : “You see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed.” He railed against Moscow for using “its entire arsenal against us” which “destroys all living things, any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals ”.Mr Zelensky added: We just want to save our people, we want to survive.” Boris Johnson is understood to have asked allies to question whether they have done enough to support Ukraine. According to a UK official, the Prime Minister said: We all want Putin to come to his senses, put his tanks into reverse - heaposs gonna grind on, only has forward gears. “Heaposs already crossed the red line into barbarism. The heroism of the Ukrainians has fundamentally changed the geopolitics of Europe... People will ask, ‘did we do enough’  I donapost think we can deny them in their moment of agony. We have the means and they have need.

In fact, Mark never bothered to look into his lineage until he and his we Tina discovered they werenapost able to safely conceive a child. After receiving the devastating news, the -year-old professor from Portland, Oregon, began searching for his birth parents, PEOPLE reports. Mark told the publication he wanted to find the connection heaposd hoped to get through having children. At the same time as he searched for his birth mother, Mark and Tina also looked into surrogacy options. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Originally from Canada, Mark applied to find his birth mother through the Canadian government, a process he described as slow. But one day, he got the call heaposd been waiting for - his mum had been tracked down and she wanted to meet him. He also found out she was now married to his birth father, and the couple had had three more children. Meanwhile Rachel Elliott, Markaposs biological sister, had been thinking about tracking down her long-lost brother - and had known heaposd existed for several years after her mum told her the story. When she learned Mark had applied to meet her and the family, she couldnapost wait for him to make contact and sent him an email.  According to Mark, the pair immediately had an extraordinarily intense connection and began emailing regularly. I became this obsessive teenager-type doing nothing but checking my email and sending responses all the time, Mark said. After seven weeks of chatting with his relatives online, Mark took Tina to Kentucky to meet them in the flesh for the first time. They were still largely strangers to me, but Iaposd never felt so comfortable, he said, adding they fit me like a glove. Just over two months later, Rachel flew over to Oregon to see the couple again - and she made them an incredible offer that sheaposd been thinking about for a long time.  On the last night of her visit while they sat down to dinner, Rachel offered to be a surrogate for Tina and Mark - and the pair accepted the offer without hesitation. And in , Markaposs twin daughters Alaska Rachel and Zoe Rachel were born - named after the aunt who carried them. Now the girls are in their teenage years, Rachel and Mark have decided to write a book about their amazing reunion and the selfless act Rachel did for her brother. The book, Love and Genetics, was released on  March and took a decade for the pair to write. Mark says the main reason he decided to write the book was so his daughters could learn more about their family - and while one of the girls has given her dad editing notes on the copy, the other is taking her time until sheaposs ready to read it. While Rachel is used to people telling her she gave her brother a beautul gt she argues sheaposs the one who got the most amazing gt of all.

She also watched a demonstration of traditional enamelling and gilding by hand by master artisans - all in the comfort of her own royal residence. The Queen was due to visit the Halcyon Days factory in Staffordshire in  to mark its own Platinum Jubilee of  years, but plans were put on hold when the pandemic struck.Much has changed since the outbreak of Covid-, with the Queen, , now using a walking stick, confessing to mobility problems, and usually carrying out only light duties at Windsor.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Last week she missed the Commonwealth Day service due to comfort issues. The extended audience on Wednesday was a rethinking of the original engagement, with the factoryaposs work and skills being brought to the Queen instead - on a minor scale. Dressed for spring in a silk floral day dress and wearing her favourite three-string pearl necklace, the Queen appeared in her element, smiling broadly as she was shown the presentation.  The intricately-decorated coffee cups and saucers and enamelled boxes were laid out on a white linen-covered table in the White Drawing Room. The Queen was said to have particularly enjoyed the visit, picking up some of the tiny enamelled boxes to inspect them. Among the items was a selection of the earliest designs - the company was founded in  just two years before the start of the Queenaposs reign.Taking a closer look at the antique pieces, the Queen held a small oval Windsor Castle trinket box with a red base, decorated with a black and white painting of the monarchaposs favourite royal residence. She also picked up a larger rectangular trinket box, edged in lavender, featuring three colour portraits of her late mother the Queen Mother as a young woman. The enamelled piece was released in  and features Samuel Warburtonaposs  triptych painting of the Queen Mother in the year she married the Queenaposs father.  The Queen Mother was an avid fan of the firmaposs creations, and first commissioned an enamel box in  of her London home Clarence House. Other members of the royal family soon followed suit, and the Queen Mother went on to issue the companyaposs first Royal Warrant in . The monarch also saw Halcyon Daysapos first-ever year box - from the Silver Jubilee of  - and viewed new Platinum Jubilee pieces which are dark blue and painted with platinum flowers of the realm.  Perched on the crook of the Queenaposs left arm was her trademark black patent Launer handbag, and she also held her walking stick as she stood to look at the display. She wore a sentimental piece of jewellery - her Flower Basket brooch - a basket of gem-studded flowers set with diamonds, sapphires, rubies and emeralds, which she was given by her parents in  to mark the birth of her first child, Prince Charles. The event was the Queenaposs first official face-to-face engagement with a number of people for more than seven weeks since her Platinum Jubilee reception at Sandringham House. She contracted Covid in February and also spent more than three months from October under doctorsapos orders to only conduct light duties. The Queen is hoping to attend the Duke of Edinburghaposs memorial service on Tuesday. Earlier today it was confirmed members of the Royal Family will attend but did not confirm the Queen would be among them. There are fears Her Majesty could miss the event in honour of her late husband of more than  years after recent bouts of bad health.

Chris Truett, , spent £ on the tulips and daffodils which he dug into the empty grass strip beside Rotten Row - one of the most iconic streets in Southport, Merseyside. It took Chris eight days to plant the flowers on the mile-long verge and they bloomed earlier this month. While they were in full bloom Sefton Council workers mowed them down as they cut the grass. Chris said he was left gobsmacked. The joiner said: I was heartbroken when I realised what had happened.Itaposs pure madness at a time when the council donapost have the resources to plant bulbs themselves. They were in full bloom. All the council had to do was wait a few weeks, until the flowers had faded away. The grass wasnapost even that long. I am absolutely gutted that all my hard work, planting thousands of bulbs out of my own money, has been for nothing. None of the people who live locally can believe it. Rotten Row, which runs next to Victoria Park, is famous for its floral displays but council cutbacks have meant volunteers are now relied on to tend the flowers. The Friends of Rotten Row maintain the beds on one side of the road, but the verge opposite was left empty until Chris decided to plant the flowers. It took him eight full weekends across October  and  to plant all , flowers. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.He bought a total of  bags of daffodil bulbs at £ each and spent a further £ on a bulb digger. He also forked out for  tulips. Chris says his flowers were left alone in spring  after he had a word with council workers. He assumed the same would happen this year and was devastated to see they have been razed when he turned up to do some litter picking on March . He believes they were cut down just days earlier. Chris added: Other councils in the UK are planting flowers. Sefton Council is cutting them down. This is an act of vandalism and a pure smack in the face for me, as a volunteer who has spent my own time and money, trying to make the town look nice.Southport used to be absolutely beautul. Over the years, itaposs really gone downhill as the council has invested less and less money. Rotten Row is a famous street in the town and used to look lovely. There were roses all along the verge, but the council couldnapost afford to maintain them so they had to go. I live here, and I want people to continue to visit. Thataposs why I spend time picking litter and planting flowers. I just want to brighten up Southport. A spokesperson for Sefton Councilaposs Green Sefton service said: Firstly, we would like to say we fully appreciate Mr Truettaposs expenditure, time and effort and can understand his disappointment and thathe would like to contact us, we will arrange a reimbursement for the bulbs planted. We are fortunate in that Sefton is rich with inidual volunteers, communities and organisations prepared to use their spare time to give back to the Borough by carrying out a range of events from litter pickings to organised plantings. We always welcome residents interested in volunteering but ask them to get in touch so we can work together to identy areas where flowers can and cannot be planted and to avoid unforeseen events like this. As Mr Truett correctly points out Rotten Row, was famous for its floral displays but reductions in Government funding have meant we no longer have the capacity to maintain these displays. Those same cutbacks mean that with limited maintenance resources, we do not have the machinery or staff required to hand-cut around the flowers in this area. We hope that in the future we can work with Mr Truett to enhance the area.

The scalpel-free treatment is as effective as standard surgery but can be carried out during a short day trip to hospital. The alternative has been cutting away inflamed tissue and opening the nasal cavity using drills with recovery taking - days.It is one of seven pioneering treatments currently available at some hospitals but being rapidly expanded to be offered nationwide.Another is an injection of an enlarged prostate - which causes a need to frequently urinate - with jets of steam to shrink it. The five-minute procedure cuts the need for surgery and comes with minimal side effects.Will any of these pioneering treatments help you  Let us know in the comment section NHS England boss Amanda Pritchard, announced the treatments will be available at all trusts from April  as part of the ‘MedTech’ plan to accelerate adoption of innovative technologies. They also include a portable chest drainage device for patients with heart and lung problems and an automated blood cell replacement system to help sickle cell disease patients live normal lives. Announcing the innovations at an NHS board meeting, Ms Pritchard said: “While many of these gadgets may be small, they will make a huge dference to the lives of tens of thousands of patients every year as well as freeing up time for NHS staff. “These cutting-edge devices show how the NHS is embracing the latest le changing technology and rolling it out at speed for patients across the country. “NHS staff are working hard to address Covid backlogs, and technology can really help us make inroads on the road to recovery.” The MedTech’ plan identies treatments found to be more efficient and in many cases less invasive. NHS England estimates that seven new MedTech technologies will save it up to £ million every year compared to traditional procedures. Sinuses can become temporarily inflamed and painful, typically due to colds or flu, allergies or pollution.Cases that continue for more than three months are termed chronic and it is not known why around , patients fail to recover.Symptoms range from headaches and nasal congestion to a loss of the sense of smell.Until recently the only option was al endoscopic sinus surgery. Carried out under general anaesthetic, this involves cutting away inflamed tissue and opening the nasal cavity using drills. Recovery takes seven to ten days and it is unsuccessful in about one in ten patients. Many sufferers refuse surgery and choose to live with the symptoms. Four of the pioneering treatments being rolled out target the prostate and could offer hope to millions of middle-aged men who suffer with an enlarged gland. Rezum is the treatment which avoids the need for more complicated surgery by using bursts of steam to shrink an enlarged prostate. John Ford, , found his prostate problems meant he lost control of his bladder. It made him scared to go very far from home until he was offered Rezum steam treatment at Cambridge University Hospital. John explained: “I was becoming anti-social. We turned down lots of invitations to go to things and in the end I opted for this procedure. “It was minimally invasive with no side effects and extraordinarily quick. “My quality of le was pretty poor but now it’s changed tremendously.” PLASMA is a new way of treating enlarged prostate with an electrical current passed through a surgical tool to cut out tissue. This seals the wound at the same time, reducing bleeding and the risk of side effects. Urolt relieves the symptoms of an enlarged prostate by using small, permanent implants to stop the gland blocking the flow of urine. Another called GreenLight tackles the problem of an enlarged prostate with a laser and can be carried out during a day trip to hospital. Matt Whitty, lead for accelerated access at NHS England, said: “These seven medical technologies and the four already supported by the policy are improving and saving lives. “Through research and innovation, we can improve patient outcomes and by supporting patients and providers to have equal access to transformative innovations and technologies and by removing barriers to adoption we will reduce health inequalities and improve equity of access for all, and in particular those patients in disproportionately affected groups.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSMedical TechnologiesHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple were at a passing out parade of the Jamaican Defence Force, where Prince William inspected service personnel from across the Caribbean who have recently completed the Caribbean Military Academy’s Officer Training Programme.Kate looked elegant in a white lace McQueen dress with matching white heels and a hat by milliner Philip Treacy as she sat in the stands with dignitaries to watch the parade. William, who inspected the officers before joining Kate in the stands, wore the topical dress of the Blues and Royals for the event.  When the event was over, they travelled away in the same open-top Land Rover that transported Williamaposs grandparents in Jamaica on their visits to the Caribbean Island in  and . The Queen and Prince Philip also visited Jamaica in  when they travelled in another Land Rover and greeted school children.William also gave a speech at the event, where he talked about good leadership and paid a direct tribute to the Queen.He said: As Catherine and I visit Jamaica in celebration of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, I thought I might quote my grandmother on the subject.  In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in , she said: ‘I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.’ I think that’s a very good model to follow. William also quoted reggae legend Bob Marley in the speech when he told those at the parade that being asked to lead men and women through uncertainty and danger is daunting. He added: ‘You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.

It has just  kilometres on the clock since it was built in .After freshening up they walked to the officers’ club, Kate hanging into her hat in the gusty weather. Inside they split up to talk to several dferent groups of soldiers and their families.William chatted to a group of officers from Sandhurst who have been helping to organise the officers’ training programme for the last  months. I thought their drill was pretty good, he said. Really impressive. Among those he spoke to was Captain Matt Tiley who had worked as a groom in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace for four years before going into the military and passing out at Sandhurst. He is now an instructor there with Marne Company. He said: It’s been such an honour to work with them. They have all been so enthusiastic. The duke clearly has fond memories of Sandhust. William told another group that they should take time to enjoy the day with their families like he did. ‘They should be very proud of you,’ he said.He and the duchess signed a visitors book before they left to change for their official departure from Jamaica . Later this afternoon William and Kate will fly on to the Bahamas, where they will stay until Saturday evening.Last night, they attended a glittering state dinner at the house of Jamaicaaposs Governor General in Kingston, where Kate dazzled in a green Jenny Packham gown and jewellery on loan from the Queen. She paired the dress with her Royal Family Order and GVCO Star - although there was no tiara. She also wore her hair in a chic updo. William, who gave a speech expressing his “profound sorrow” over the stain of slavery on Britain, also looked suave in black tie. During his speech, William said he “strongly agreed” with his father Prince Charles’s previous declaration that Britain is forever stained by its role in the global slave trade.He said: “Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened. As they arrived and were greeted by the Governor General Patrick Allen, William told them they had a brilliant day in Jamaica. Kate added that she also had a fantastic day and said thank you for having us back again.The couple also walked down a set of stairs in the Governor Generalaposs house that the Queen and Prince Philip walked down in when they visited Jamaica in  - recreating that moment.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince WilliamRoyal FamilyKate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At the airport, Kate wore a stunning green Emilia Wickstead dress that she previously wore just last year on a visit to Wimbledon. Pinned to the dress was an incredible brooch on loan from the Queen, which shows a hummingbird.The brooch was a gt to the Queen from Jamaica in  - her Golden Jubilee year. As William and Kate climbed aboard their RAF Voyager plane, they waved to the those gathered before flying on to the Bahamas.Earlier in the day, William and Kate echoed the Queen and Prince Philip as they attended their final engagement in Jamaica. The couple were at a passing out parade of the Jamaican Defence Force, where Prince William inspected service personnel from across the Caribbean who have recently completed the Caribbean Military Academy’s Officer Training Programme.

Click here to sign up .Kate looked elegant in a white lace McQueen dress with matching white heels and a hat by milliner Philip Treacy as she sat in the stands with dignitaries to watch the parade. William, who inspected the officers before joining Kate in the stands, wore the topical dress of the Blues and Royals for the event.  When the event was over, they travelled away in the same open-top Land Rover that transported Williamaposs grandparents in Jamaica on their visits to the Caribbean Island in  and . The Queen and Prince Philip also visited Jamaica in  when they travelled in another Land Rover and greeted school children. William also gave a speech at the event, where he talked about good leadership and paid a direct tribute to the Queen. He said: As Catherine and I visit Jamaica in celebration of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, I thought I might quote my grandmother on the subject. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in , she said: ‘I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.’ I think that’s a very good model to follow.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Tom said: I don’t think it’s been done before, that’s for sure. It all happened because me and my climbing partner are the world’s most established or experienced roof crack climbers, and we’ve done most of the worldaposs hardest roof crack climbs.We had the pandemic and couldn’t travel, so we started hunting under bridges for the same thing.We thought they might exist between the concrete girders beneath bridges, we personally visited maybe hundreds and also had a whole Instagram and social media community looking out for them for us. We had people from all over the world looking for us.The one we settled on came from a friend who said they’d spotted something on Google maps, and another person from the area who said we should go check it out. It was just one of those on a whim vague suggestions that might work out, and it actually did.When Tom visited the site he was amazed, as he was expecting to see some sort of obstacle blocking the climb but instead he was greeted by unspoilt concrete as far as the eye could see.He continued: I was pretty certain it was something that was very very unique. I’ve looked at a lot of bridge roof cracks and I’ve never seen anything that – it’s continuous with no breaks in it, very clean line with no obstructing girders. It’s a once in a letime thing and I feel very lucky to have found it. Plus it was in Devon, so we could get to it.The Great Rt took Tom and Pete almost four whole days to complete, and during that time they never once touched the ground - sleeping on a ledge that they strung up beneath the M.The climb has been referred to as the aposEl Capapos of Bridges, referring to the iconic rock formation in Yosemite National Park, which was climbed without ropes by Alex Honnold in .Tom continued: On a bridge, the main things are that the concrete flexes and moves continually, so it’s a little bit scary because the protection youaposre placing in the crack feels less reliable, and the handholds are constantly moving size. It’s very noisy because of the M traffic, and it’s very dirty because of the dust and oil residue has washed down the crack. And you’ve got the public thinking you’re some kind of protester. They tend to call the police too, they came out and we got pulled down the first time. It took us four days to complete the climb, we slept on a portable bed underneath the M. Iaposve done it a lot, I’ve been climbing for  years. For the general population, it seems bizarre and scary, butyou’re a professional climber it’s a tool of the trade so you’re used to it. Not under the M though, that’s pretty unique. It’s a touch quieter at night. In the daytime, it is very noisy but it quietens down a bit. It’s a climb with a great deal of irony, we’re supposed to be out in the wilds and enjoying nature but there we are under the M. It feels very British, and bizarre.Lots of other things we’ve done are a bit odd so it fits in well - If you ask people in the climbing industry about us they’ll tell you we do things dferently.Tom and Pete are both professional climbers and would like to thank their sponsors Raab, Wild Country, Rhino Skin, Tendon Ropes, Unparalleled Shoes, Sterling Ropes and Patagonia.Their story features in the documentary Bridge Boys, which premieres in Reel Rock, an annual climbing film festival, on March .

Courtney Webber has shared her heartbreak that little Oscar and Theo are expected to live short lives but continue to have the biggest smiles. When Oscar was bone, Courtney knew something was wrong when she noticed tremors in his head and yes.However, she was told not to worry, she demanded tests and the now-three-year-old was found he had Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease, reports Staffordshire Live.Mrs Webber was pregnant with her second son Theo at the time and invasive tests showed he also had the condition.The -year-old mum was given the agonising option to terminate the pregnancy, but she says she knew in her heart it was the right decision to keep her boy. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease is a rare le-limiting brain condition, affecting only one in , children in the UK. It causes progressive deterioration and the boys have been given a prognosis of around  years. Mrs Webber said: Oscar has the biggest smile in the world - he just lights up the room. Heaposs created the most beautul bond with my nine-month-old. Weaposre watching them grow and flourish together. Itaposs an awful situation weaposre in, but weaposre making the best of it. Iaposve always said there are two roads that you can go down - the dark and dingy road or making the best of the situation. Itaposs how you deal with it - and I always go down the positive path. Itaposs how I am with everything. You could be anxious and stressed all the time, but we do what we can to give them the best quality of le so they can enjoy their childhood. People say Iaposm strong, but I donapost know where I get it from - I guess having children gave me that instinct. We live with this situation and have never had an able child, so weaposve not experienced that. What we know is how to care for children with disabilities. Itaposs about having the right mindset and attitude. It can feel isolating as we are dferent to everyone . We can go to a childaposs party and theyaposll be the only disabled children there. People will look and watch, which they wouldnapost do to any other child. It can be a very isolating feeling so we want to raise awareness of this condition. The boys also have a very special bond with their nanny, Maura Rivers, and sheaposs always there with help and support. The couple had been trying for a baby for three years when they found out they were expecting Oscar not long after getting married. A test at  weeks found they were on the cusp of being a high-risk pregnancy, but it was not until Oscar was born the tremours were noticed. It was not thought to be anything signicant at first, with many doctors telling the couple the same thing, but then they got a call from Birminghamaposs Childrenaposs Hospital after a genetic test - and Oscar was found to have the rare condition. It comes from the X-linked gene and is carried by the mother.If the mum has the gene, then there is a   chance the x-gene will go into the male child and they will inherit the change. Mrs Webber had no idea she was carrying the condition and has urged other parents to keep pushing for answersthey have concerns over their childaposs health. The couple then found out Theo would also be born with the condition. They had to make a devastating decision no parent should be faced with. Mrs Webber said: We were faced with the decision of do we continue with the pregnancy and we had to make it quickly. If we decided to go through with the termination, Iaposd have had to take a tablet to stop the heartbeat and the doctor would deliver the baby. I knew in my heart I had to have Theo. He had as much right to live and we knew weaposd give that baby the world and the best quality of le possible. It was also so Oscar didnapost feel isolated as someone had the same condition as him and they were in it together. Itaposs created that strong bond. I feel for parents whose children have this condition and they donapost know. Iaposd urge them to follow their instincts, as,they donapost, no-one  will. We donapost know how much time theyaposve got, but weaposre glad we know, as we can deal with it. Little Oscar walks with a frame and has a wheelchair, but no problems with talking and cognitive development. He currently has physiotherapy and water therapy to help his movement and there are adaptions around the house to help him.  His family knows his health will deteriorate over time, as will Theoaposs as he gets older, and he will not be able to walk when his muscles become stfer. He may also struggle to swallow his food and will lose basic skills, but his parents are doing all they can to give him the best chance. Mrs Webber has had to give up her job as a property manager to become a full-time carer for her children. She said: It is isolating sometimes but you try to do the best you can. Yes it is heart-breaking but where we are from  months ago is completely dferent. Our mindset is completely dferent and we can talk about it now.The family have been fund-raising so they can create special memories and days out with their sons, while helping with the cost of treatment not covered on the NHS.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the coronavirus pandemic could delay diagnosis and treatment, meaning more undetected cases.Her warning comes after provisional data revealed , cases of TB were recorded in England last year.While Dr Laura Cleghorn, of the University of Dundee warned there is a pressing need to develop new treatments for the illness which some wrongly think of as a disease of yesteryear.The bacterial infection is spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.Treatment for the illness has come a long way but it is still a potentially serious condition which needs to be cured using antibiotics, according to the NHS website.Have you tested positive for TB during the Covid pandemic  Let us know at webnews@mirror In , worldwide deaths due to TB ranked second only to Covid, in terms of infectious disease.Dr Harries told the BBC: It is important to remember not every persistent cough, along with fever, is Covid-.A cough that usually has mucus and lasts longer than three weeks can be caused by a range of other issues, including tuberculosis.Meanwhile, campaigners fear the pandemic and conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, have set back crucial funding to halt the spread. Todayis World Tuberculosis Day, with charity the Stop TB Partnership calling for an urgent and substantial increase of funding to fight TB in order to meet the goal of ending the disease by . Dr Lucica Ditiu, the organisationaposs executive director, said:We simply cannot continue to stand on the sidelines and watch while people around the world fall ill and die from a preventable and treatable disease.We also cannot continue to accept what we accepted for years - every year having less than % of the funding need for the TB response. Now we are facing a disastrous funding shortfall, bigger than what we had expected. We not only need to step up efforts to meet targets set at the  UNHLM on TB, but the TB response must also recover from the devastating impacts of the Covid- pandemic. The Stop TB Partnership also warned the Ukraine invasion could have devastating impacts on health services, including the war-torn nationaposs TB treatment programme. The charity is urging all countries taking Ukrainian refugees to put the correct provisions in place to treat those who need it. Last year, Ukraine treated , people with TB including , with a drug-resistant form of the illness. In Britain, a requirement for Ukrainians to take a TB test before arrival has been waived for those on the family scheme visa - though such people will get medical care and testing from GPs.

Cloisters Gulf Petrol Station in Cha, west London made headlines in October when it sold out of unleaded petrol - despite selling it for £. a litre. At that point that was double the national average price. Five months on the upmarket fuel dispensary has started shting the combustible liquid for £., p more than its price three weeks ago. The sky high price tag puts it in the running for the most expensive petrol in the UK. Do you have a petrol station near you that tops Cloisteraposs prices  Email webnews@mirror  The signicant cost of fuelling up at Cloisters was clocked the day after Rishi Sunak attempted to address the increasingly unaffordable nature of filling up a car. The Chancellor announced a p cut in fuel duty, effective as of yesterday evening. After the announcement Asda, Tesco, Sainsburyaposs and Morrisons announced that they would be lowering the cost of their petrol.UK motorists are now being forced to pay an average of £. a litre for unleaded and £. a litre for diesel. That means Cloisters is selling petrol for p more than the typical petrol station. Yesterday RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes warned that the Chancelloraposs decision to cut fuel duty would only help consumersretailers passed on the savings. There’s also a very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices, he said. If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers. It also wouldn’t be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply. Changes in prices at the pump are linked to the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate. Brent crude was trading down .% on the day at . per barrel on the day - also up  per barrel on the week. Fuel prices first started rising due to high global demand as the UK began to come out of the coronavirus crisis. But the war in Ukraine has pushed up prices even higher, largely down to sanctions of the imports of Russian-sourced oil.

Parts of some documents in the Duke of Sussex’s claim against the Home Office will be kept secret the judge ruled as he also criticised his lawyer. Shaheed Fatima QC, for the duke, took full responsibility. The Duke of Sussex is bringing a claim against the department after being told he would no longer be given the “same degree” of personal protective security when visiting from the US, despite offering to pay for it himself. The duke wants to bring his children to visit from the US, but he and his family are “unable toto his home” because it is too dangerous, a representative previously said. He is challenging the February  decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures – known as Ravec – which has delegated powers from the Home Secretary.  At a preliminary hearing last month, the High Court in London heard an application by both sides for some parts of the court documents in the case to be kept private. In a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Swt said the bid to withhold or redact documents – including a confidential witness statement made by Harry – was allowed. The judge said: “Some of the information relied on concerns security arrangements put in place either for the claimant or for other public figures in the United Kingdom. For obvious reasons information on such matters usually remains confidential.” Mr Justice Swt said that some parts of his reasons for the decision would have to remain confidential as well. He added that editing out information from court documents would “avoid the risk that putting information into the public domain concerning security arrangements made on past occasions, and the general approach to whether andso what arrangements should be made, may impair the effectiveness of arrangements in place now, or which may be put in place in the future”. “Information about these matters would self-evidently be of interest to anyone wishing to harm a person within the scope of the security arrangements and would assist them to piece together previous practice with a view to anticipating present or future security provision,” he continued. Thursday’s ruling only covers the redaction of documents and does not decide the merits of duke’s claim against the Home Office, orit can go to a full hearing. After the judgment was made public, Mr Justice Swt criticised Harry’s legal team for breaking the embargo on the document. High Court judgments are typically provided to lawyers in the case under embargo in a draft form ahead of being made public. However, Mr Justice Swt said that a copy of Thursday’s ruling had been emailed to someone who was not a lawyer, against court rules, calling this “entirely unacceptable”. Shaheed Fatima QC, for the duke, said she and her team were unsure about whether sending the draft judgment last week was a breach, but had decided to report it to the judge on Wednesday. However, the senior judge said it was a “clear breach” and questioned why it had not been raised immediately. Mr Justice Swt continued: “It should have been obvious that what happened was a breach. At the very least, it should have been obvious that it needed to be reported to the judge, me, at as soon as possible.” “It is also unacceptable that you come without an apology to the court,” he later said.  Ms Fatima said she took full responsibility and apologised “for the fact that I didn’t think fully before the emails were sent”. At a hearing last month, Ms Fatima told the court that Harry considers the UK “is and always will be his home”. A representative for Harry previously said the duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. However, Robert Palmer QC, for the Home Office, previously told the court the duke’s offer of private funding was “irrelevant”. In written submissions, he said: “Personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis, and Ravec does not make decisions on the provision of such security on the basis that any financial contribution could be sought or obtained to pay for it.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Home OfficePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Roya went on to say she was confused by Harry and Meghanaposs claims the Duchess was denied help for her mental health after saying she had suicidal thoughts, as Harry would have all of the external support at his fingertips. Harry is the most literate and clued-up person on mental health that I have ever met, going back many years, she said. He has every single organisation plugged into [mental health] at his fingertips.

The charity said it was one of the aposworst casesapos theyaposd ever seen in the country.  Dobermann Rescue UK chair Liz Price says Martha is now recovering well from her ordeal and, due to being too young to live in the charityaposs Bucknall kennels, she is currently being looked after at home by Liz before joining her new family. Liz, who has three Dobermanns of her own, said: The operation has gone really well and she is not at all fazed by it. It hasnapost slowed her down and she is recovering very well. The vet managed to save a small part of her ears and she looks like a little teddy bear now. She will go to her new aposforever homeapos on Wednesday with owners who have been on our waiting list and already have another Dobermann for her to play with. They are delighted to give her a home. Nobody wants to put a puppy through an operation and in an ideal world she would still have the ears she was born with, but it has worked out the best we could hope for.

The pair were at a glittering state dinner at the house of Jamaicaaposs Governor-General in Kingston, where politicians and other dignitaries were invited. The black-tie event not only called on Prince William and Kate to wear some of their finest clothes, it also saw William make a landmark speech, where he addressed slavery. In the speech, William said he “strongly agreed” with his father Prince Charles’s previous declaration that Britain is forever stained by its role in the global slave trade.He said: “Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened.  And knowing what an important night it would be for the couple, it seems the Queen made a supportive gesture to Kate. She loaned her some dazzling emerald and diamond jewellery to pair with his gorgeous green gown. The earrings and bracelet come from the Queenaposs Emerald Tassel Parure collection, which Her Majesty has been pictured in on several occasions.

The full set comprises earrings, a bracelet and a necklace - although Kate did not wear the necklace last night. The origins of the pieces have never been confirmed but they are thought to hail from the United Arab Emirates. Last night Kate paired the jewellery with a stunning Jenny Packham off the shoulder ruffle gown as well as her Royal Family Order and GVCO Star - although there was no tiara. Meanwhile, earlier today, William and Kate echoed the Queen and Prince Philip as they attended their final engagement in Jamaica today on day six of their Caribbean tour.The couple were at a passing out parade of the Jamaican Defence Force, where William inspected service personnel from across the Caribbean who have recently completed the Caribbean Military Academy’s Officer Training Programme. Kate looked elegant in a white lace McQueen dress with matching white heels and a hat by milliner Philip Treacy as she sat in the stands with dignitaries to watch the parade. William, who inspected the officers before joining Kate in the stands, wore the topical dress of the Blues and Royals for the event. When the event was over, they travelled away in the same open-top Land Rover that transported Williamaposs grandparents in Jamaica in . It echoed the scene when the Queen and her late husband were greeted by thousands of cheering schoolchildren on the Caribbean island  years ago as part of Her Majestyaposs Coronation tour.

The fen raft spider is making an unprecedented comeback. And while arachnophobes will be sweating at the prospect, it is positive news that an endangered species is back from the brink. It is also, thankfully, harmless to humans - and unlikely to be lurking under the sofa. An RSPB report released this week stating numbers of the semi-aquatic fen raft - which has an impressive leg span of three inches - are now into the thousands.  It is the biggest of Britainaposs  spider species. The RSPBaposs Tim Strudwick said: This is one of the UK’s rarest invertebrates, as beautul as any, and we are really proud of the part our reserve and team has played in its recovery. The females are impressive in size, but elegant and quite beautul, even to an arachnophobe .  The best chance of spotting them is in the wetland areas, such as RSPB Strumpshaw Fen in the Norfolk Broads. Tim went on to say: The spiders are only seen in the grazing marsh ditches, and are fairly shy, but they are easy to find from June to September when the mature females have their young. The fen raft spider is a striking creature with a dark body and cream stripes down the side.  It is a protected species under the Wildle and Countryside Act due to its high risk of extinction. A pioneering translocation project between conservation partners and funders - which included the RSPB, as well as the British Arachnological Society, Suffolk and Sussex Wildle Trusts, Natural England, and the Broads Authority - has helped give the species a shot in the arm. Up until  there were only three known populations in the UK, leaving the species very vulnerable and at real risk.  Two years later they were first released onto the RSPB reserve in the hopes of giving the species a chance. But itaposs taken time for a signicant impact to be felt. Nursery webs amounted to just  during the July-October  season. The recently released RSPB Ecology Report assessed the state of Britainaposs wildle, including the struggling fen raft. It showed that in  the total number of females found in the Mid Yare area of the Norfolk Broads is believed to now be in the thousands. It is now present in  one-hectare grid squares at two fens on the Norfolk Broads, the report added.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationfound the vessel Industry beneath the waves in the Gulf of Mexico.The -foot-long ship, or what remains of it, was operated by the descendants of African enslaved people and Native Americans in one of the nationaposs oldest industries, the organisation said. Researchers found the boat at a depth of , feet. The ship was used to hunt whales across the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico for  years.  A statement from NOAA read: It was lost when a strong storm snapped its masts and opened its hull to the sea on May , . Industry was whaling primarily for sperm whales more than  miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River. It is the only whaling ship known to have been lost in the Gulf of Mexico out of  whaling voyages from the s to the s. The crew members were reportedly picked up by another vessel, named the Elizabeth, which took them back to port.The NOAA statement continued: While the crew list for the last voyage of Industry disappeared when the ship sank, lists of crews from previous voyages describe crewmembers and officers as including Black people, Native Americans, White people and multiracial people. The brig is connected to the le of Paul Cuffe, a mariner and entrepreneur whose father was a freed slave and mother was a Wampanoag Indian.  Cuffe started whaling as a teenager and rose to become a successful ship builder, merchant, abolitionist, philanthropist, founder of an integrated public school and among the leaders of a project to settle freed Black people in a new colony in Africa. His son William was a navigator on Industry and his son-in-law, Pardon Cook, was an officer on the brig, and believed to have made the most whaling voyages of any Black person in American history. The presence of African and Native American crew members is signicant, given the widespread slavery and discrimination of both people at the time. NOAA Administrator DR Rick Spinrad said: Today we celebrate the discovery of a lost ship that will help us better understand the rich story of how people of colour succeeded as captains and crew members in the nascent American whaling industry of the early s.  The discovery reflects how African Americans and Native Americans prospered in the ocean economy despite facing discrimination and other injustices. It is also an example of how important partnerships of federal agencies and local communities are to uncovering and documenting our nationaposs maritime history. NOAA vessel Okeanos Explorer controlled a remote vehicle using a satellite link to explore the seafloor on Friday,  February. The findings have just been made public. US Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said: Black and Native American history is American history, and this critical discovery serves as an important reminder of the vast contributions Black and Native Americans have made to our country. This th century whaling ship will help us learn about the lives of the Black and Native American mariners and their communities, as well as the immense challenges they faced on land and at sea.

The adorable white Samoyed lives with his owner, Krysten Pierre, , on their farm in Blind Bight, Victoria, Australia, and he is completely and utterly obsessed with all of his calf siblings. From playing to sleeping, eating and even snuggling, thereaposs absolutely nothing Snow wonapost do to stop the sweet baby cows from feeling sad and alone. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Krysten said: Snow has always been so gentle with the cows. When they first come to the rescue, they’re always so scared and timid, and for most cases, they’ve only been born a day. It’s such a change in their short span of le, but Snow is there with them every step of the way. Krysten has been fostering cows for her local rescue ‘Till The Cow’s Come Home’ for the past few years, and has documented the bonds that Snow forms with the calves.  Speaking about Snow, Krysten said: He’s always been drawn to the sick and weaker baby cows that come in, and he’ll always go and cuddle up to them whilst they recover and settle in. As they settle in more, Snow will start to play with them, and is always super gentle as he knows he’s a bit bigger than they are. Equally, the cows love Snow. Quite a few of them form a really special bond with him and are always by his side.  One of the cows, Teddy, was obsessed with him and used to follow him everywhere, always wanting to play and do every little thing with him. One of our current fosters, Bliss, is about the same size as Snow, so they love playing boisterously together. All of the cows that come to the rescue are usually orphaned due to their parents being slaughtered or used within the dairy industry. Snow was also an orphaned pup, who was put up for adoption in a local newspaper.  Mum-of-two Krysten said: Part of me thinks that because Snow was orphaned and moved from home to home too, he kind of understands how the cows feel. He’s a very empathetic soul, who will just hang out with the cows until they feel comfortable. It’s like he knows when we are going to get more foster cows too, as he’ll always be at the front gate ready to greet them. He’s so lovely and gentle with every creature and human that he comes into contact with.Do you have a dog story to sell  Email nia.dalton@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsAdoptionCows\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the hours ticked by, the parents got increasingly worried and waited by the door for her until she eventually ed home at :am. She tried her hardest to go undetected, he said, as she quietly parked the car on the drive and opened the front door without making much noise. But of course, sheaposd been caught red-handed. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the couple asked her for an explanation, she answered honestly and told them that sheaposd gone over to her boyfriendaposs house after dropping her grandparents off. I told her as punishment that she is grounded for the rest of the school year and that she would not get to go to her senior prom, in spite of her already picking out a prom dress, he said. But thataposs not all. Her other punishments included: no access to the car until graduation, no iPhone, no friends, no going outside, and her prom dress will be donated. While my we agrees with most of the punishments Iaposve laid out, she does not think she should have to miss her senior prom, especially since it was cancelled last school year, he added. My least-favourite part of parenting is having to dish out consequences for undesirable behaviour, but what our daughter did crossed the line and worried us.As such, I told my we that I need to stick to my guns in every part of her punishment, but sheaposs hellbent on letting our daughter at least attend prom. He concluded his post by asking: Should we let her off of her grounding for prom, or should I stick to my word  Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on the situation, many of which said his punishment was too harsh. One person said: Dude, [youaposre the a**hole]. Did she break the rules and acted like a complete dumba** while making you worried  Absolutely. Does it warrant a punishment  Of course, it does. Should that punishment be her missing a once-in-a-letime event that would otherwise be a fond memory sheaposd look years down the lane and will now only remember your cruel punishment  Do you really want it to be so  Punishment should fit the crime, and yours is waaaay overblown. Another agreed: One instance of breaking curfew and you go completely scorched earth.

The open-minded -year-old has proven popular among those with a aposgiantessapos fetish, with some videos seeing her walking in slow motion towards her phone, which she will position on the floor to give her a larger appearance. To the great thrill of her followers, Jesse will also crush and aposeatapos tiny figurines and will sometimes even stomp on her phone to help bring the fantasy to le. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Jesse - who has racked up , followers on Instagram @jesse.switch.irl- said: “Being funny and sexual is something that is seriously overlooked. A kink I explore with fans involves me playing the part of a giantess.“I’m always interested in where these kinks come from and, with the giantess fantasy, it’s usually about the idea of complete surrender. She continued: They like the thrill of me looking huge and them feeling tiny, and the uncertainty of what I’ll do next. Other people like it to continue on to me crushing or eating them – having the ultimate dominance asserted. “In one video I bought a tiny figurine of a man less than an inch tall and threw it into my mouth and pretended to swallow. In other videos, fans want to be crushed by me so I’ll either stomp, stand or sit on my phone. Some people want to fantasise about being stomped or sat on, but sometimes they want to be picked up, teased, and then crushed specically between my butt cheeks or breasts. Iaposve certainly got the curves to be able to stuff a whole camera into my cleavage or my butt, so thataposs another aspect of the fantasy that Iaposm able to really bring to le.  Once, Jesse even made a video for a fan who asked her to crush everything but him, including his office, house, and gym. She then picked him up and put him in my bra, telling him I would keep him as a pet.Although some might think her work is quite extreme, Jesse says itaposs really just about being freed from responsibility and cared for, and it has given her a passion for supporting menaposs mental health. Jesse, who spends around - hours each day building connections with fans, added: “It sounds corny but I have a special connection with my fans. I have some who I never even talk about anything sexual with – one man just sends me silly dad jokes or we exchange pictures of our pets. “These are fun, kinky, romantic people, andthey can be that way with me, they can be with someone  too.

In a TikTok video that has clocked up .k likes, Tori can be seen carrying a coffee cup as she follows the employee into the gt shop, claiming sheaposd just experienced getting dress coded at Disney.However, it would seem that - on reflection - Tori can now see the employeeaposs side of things, as she later admitted I mean, I kinda agree with them looking back at this video.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Once at the checkout, Tori - who goes by the username toragrams - was given a yellow t-shirt before being allowed to continue her day.Some of Toriaposs followers have been unable to see the issue with her original top, with one person commenting: I- that’s literally probably one of the least revealing crop tops you could wear… at least the shirt was free. Another wrote: I’m sorry but they reached with this one. There is nothing wrong with your original top. I’ve seen so much worse. However, others could see potential hazards posed by the crop top. One wrote: It’s not a aposbadapos aposshowyapos crop top but I could see them wanting you to wear something  in case you went on rides and accidentally flashed an eight-year-old. And a commenter claiming to be an ex-employee added: The rule is that your top can’t have just a string to hold it togetherthat makes sense.In response to the comments, Tori alleged that the lady who scanned me in just had it out for me, but remarked that she might have just been in a bad mood. She went on to clary that she has no hard feelings about her experience overall.According to guidelines published on the Disney World website: Disney reserves the right to deny admission to or remove any person wearing attire that is considered inappropriate or attire that could detract from the experience of other Guests.This includes clothing which, by nature, exposes excessive portions of the skin that may be viewed as inappropriate for a family environment.The Mirror has reached out to Disney for comment.

Itaposs not just Brits who are relentlessly pestered the them. The historic Gritti Hotel near the Grand Canal have reacted to a number of complaints about the gulls this year. On one concerning occasion, one flew off with an entire steak just as the waiter lted the lid off the plate he was serving it on” one worrying report stated. But tourists in Italy donapost even need to spray the pesky animals.  According to Paolo Lorenzoni, a director at the hotel, they really do not like orange - the colour of the pistols he has handed to guests. That, he says, is often enough to send them flying off into the distance, for a while at least.They really work and theyaposre also coloured orange, which those birds donapost like, Mr Lorenzoni told ANSA. As soon as they see the pistols, they just fly away. So really you donapost even need to use them, you just need to keep them on the table. The Gritti had also previously experimented with a fake owl and a falcon to hunt down the thieving creatures and they feel their latest ideal is already a big winner. Attacks by up to  gulls are not uncommon in Venice, causing serious disruption and annoyance. It has also been claimed that the birds have been spotted stealing food from inside peopleaposs mouths as they walked around the incredible city. Other strategies have also been put forward by visitors. Claudio Scarpa, president of the Venice hoteliers’ association, thinks that birds of prey could be the answer. “We could introduce a falcon-sharing system between hotels with one falconer sending a falcon to cover dferent terraces,” he said.

And yet rumours of a vast private income eclipsing that of the worldaposs richest people, secret relationships and a partner hidden from view have circulated for years. Information has slowly leaked out, despite Putinaposs command to Russian media outlets that: I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected. Here is what we known about the Russian president.  The wealth A billion mansion known as aposPutinaposs Palaceapos and a £m superyacht are believed to be highlights of his portfolio - but there are also reports he has  other homes,  planes and helicopters,  cars and a watch collection worth , The Russian president is even known to have flaunted his power through ownership of outlandish pets - including a tiger called Boris, who he released into the wild on live TV in . Speaking to the Washington Post, hedge fund manager Bill Browder estimated Putinaposs wealth was around billion USD - but his fortune is surrounded by mystery.While itaposs well-known that Putin owns several luxury properties in Russia, one particular mansion reported to belong to the Russian president has turned heads in recent weeks.The so-called aposPutinaposs Palace,apos which is thought to be worth more than  billion, was reportedly built for Putinaposs personal use.  In January nearly  photos of the lavish mansion were published by Alexei Navalnyaposs Anti-Corruption Fund, set up by the outspoken Putin critic who is now in jail. Georgy Alburov, a researcher for the Foundation, said the palace was decorated in a style similar to that youaposd expect from King Louis XIV. In , Newsweek reported the Russian president had ordered the production of a bulletproof fleet of limos in Russia, estimated to be worth  million. While Putin has no problem showing off how much money he has tied up in assets, heaposs less forthcoming about where the money came from in the first place. There have been a number of estimates about just how wealthy Putin and his family is, with one speculating he could be worth as much as up to £billion. That would make him richer than Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Ex-we  Putinaposs current relationship status is a bit of a mystery, amid speculation that he moved on very quickly after separating from his we of  years. He admitted he had a habit of leading a bacheloraposs le until it was uprooted by former air hostess Lyudmila Putina. They met in their home city of Leningrad, now St Petersburg, when a mutual friend invited Putin to see a play along with several girlfriends. Putin is said to have hidden that he worked as a KGB spy for much of their three-year courtship and they married in July . The couple had two daughters, Mariya, in April , and Yekaterina, in August , after they had moved to Germany when Putin was stationed as a Soviet spy. Working  and -hour days took its toll on his family le and in June  they announced they were separating just weeks before their th wedding anniversary. Appearing on state television after attending a ballet together, Putin admitted that rumours he and his we no longer lived together were true and she had done with her sht as Russiaaposs First Lady.In the wake of Putin’s Ukraine invasion, Katerinaaposs French holiday home in Biarritz was vandalised with the colours of the Ukrainian flag. The secret lover Over the years, Putin has been dogged by rumours of an affair, something which he has always denied.But they were compounded when political rival Alexi Navalny claimed he had wed former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva in a secret ceremony.Kabaeva won a gold medal for Russia at the Athens Olympics Games in  before retiring from the sport and entering politics.Once regarded as Russiaaposs most eligible woman, the only other suitor she has been linked to by the media was a married Georgian policeman but this relationship was said to have petered out by . Rumours first linked Alina, who is  years younger than Putin, romantically to the Russian leader as long ago as  when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin’s marriage Lyudmila and believed she had become the new Russian First Lady.  There have been frequent reports that Putin is the alleged father of up to five children with Kabaeva, who vanished completely in . One popular Russian newspaper called her the First Lady, but in the shadows. She reportedly gave birth to Putinaposs son Dmitry in , before a daughter arrived in , another alleged child in  before the birth of twin boys in . Around the time of the most recent births she was awarded the the countryaposs highest civilian medal For Merit to the Fatherland by Putin.After not being seen for two-and-a-half years, Kabaeva dramatically reappeared in public last summer to renounce Tokyo  judges after Russian star Dina Averina failed to win a gold medal in rhythmic gymnastics. The children As for Putinaposs official children, he likes to keep them away from the cameras and little is known about their lives. Eldest daughter Maria, , has a career in medical research and is an expert on dwarfism, according to reports. She is married to Dutch businessman, Jorrit Faassen, and is believed to be the mother of Putinaposs two confirmed grandchildren, who were born in  and . Meanwhile, Katerina, , goes by the family name of her maternal grandmother, Tikhonova, and is a former acrobatic dancer. She has a degree in physics and mathematic and is now spearheading a major Russian articial intelligence initiative.  Putinaposs second eldest daughter was married to Russia’s youngest billionaire, Kirill Shamalov, but they reportedly separated in . The thing is, I don’t want them to grow up like hereditary princes, I want them to grow up to be normal people, Putin told Russian TV in . If I mention ages and names, they would be identied and never left alone. One of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as Elizaveta Krivonogikh in November . It has been claimed that her mother Svetlana Krivonogikh, , had an affair with the strongman leader when he was head of the FSB counterintelligence service. Putinaposs alleged current partner Kabaeva, , is said to be holed up in a very private and very secure chalet in Switzerland, a source told Page Six.  The couple are thought to have had four secret children together, although there has never been any official confirmation of either their relationship or their kids. Alina has two young boys and twin girls with Putin who were born in Switzerland, the source added. The kids all have Swiss passports, and I imagine she does also. Kabaeva is now facing calls to be kicked out of Switzerland and deport her to Russia. A petition to do so has now gained more than , signatories.

Nahlu Blos de Mores - who has their eyeballs tattooed - has said that people assume they are a bad parent and unemployed because of their unconventional appearance. The -year-old content creator now has more than  tattoos across their body, including floral tattoos covering their whole neck. They also have undergone a tongue splitting procedure in which the tongue is cut in two to look like a snakeaposs. The Brazilian single parent, who got their piece of ink at , said: I got my first tattoo when I was just fteen years old. I got my eyebrows done and I have to admit that I hate them. Aged seventeen, I got my first tattoo in a tattoo shop, and my dad went with me to sign the papers. I now have sixty-two tattoos and Iaposm currently planning a full body suit of tattoos. Most of my tattoos have been done by my friends or colleagues from other tattoo studios, so I always do exchanges for these.  Nahlu said when they are out in public people constantly stare. One year ago, Nahlu came out as trans non-binary and has since been taking testosterone as part of their transition. They hope that the mastectomy surgery they are currently crowdfunding for, will give them the confidence toto nude modelling. Nahlu, parent to Ezaiah, seven and Kaylan who is three said that not everyone is supportive of their unique look and is often judged before people get to know them - they often rely on personal contacts and friends to find a place for their family to live. Nahlu says that their children love their tattoos and even get temporary sticker tattoos themselves. They said: I also find that people judge me for the way I look and it has been dficult for me to rent houses for example, as people always judge me before knowing me.  I thought people would not support my modelling work anymore, because maybe people supported me because they saw me as a woman. The fact is that I have never been a woman. I have socialized as a woman, but I wasnapost and Iaposm not a man. My children absolutely love my tattoos and love getting temporary sticker tattoos themselves. I came out as trans nonbinary one year ago and it was a very dficult decision but I felt so much freedom after. I was afraid that I would not be accepted by my family and friends and at my work. In the beginning everything was dficult but they are now respectful and this is important.The changes to my body have had a big impact on my career as a nude model. Iaposm not comfortable modelling for naked shoots until I have a mastectomy, so I have set up a Crowdfunder to help pay for this surgery.

Giulia Schf is the only woman currently enrolled in the International Legion among thousands of other volunteers.The -year-old is in Kyiv fighting as a Special Forces soldier in Volodymyr Zelenskyaposs International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine.Ms Schfaposs military career in Italy was cut short when she was kicked out of the Italian Air Force Academy in  after she reported alleged hazing she had suffered at the hands of eight sergeants. She made headlines two years ago when footage emerged of her being injured by colleagues in an initiation prank.  The pilot said that her head was pounded against the wing of a plane, her backside whipped and she was thrown into a swimming pool during the hazing ritual. The young woman was axed from the air force after complaining about the prank - although her military bosses claimed she was expelled for insufficient military aptitude. The day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine officially began, Ms Schf posted on Facebook that she had not seen from Europe the reaction that Ukraine deserves for the havoc wrought on them by Putin.She wrote: There is no justication for not reacting. Acting is a duty.We need to help a country that cannot defend itself, invaded by one of the worldaposs powers, among other things for ridiculous reasons... She reportedly left for Ukraine, in utmost secrecy, a few days after her Facebook post. After a few days of training Ms Schf was given her first missions, gun in hand, near the Ukrainian capital. It is currently unclear where exactly she is, largely due to security reasons, but Schf has reportedly been in touch with an Italian journalist, with whom she is said to have been friends for some years. She told the journalist: I was born for this, to help our Ukrainian brothers and to prevent the war from reaching us. She also reportedly said: I am going against the tide. While many are fleeing, I head towards the fighting areas.

How many useless words, but what penalties  How come we are able to really help and instead we just watch  she told Italian media. Are they really worried about the price of petrol and the refugees who will emigrate  All this hypocrisy will have consequences. Shame.

Johnni DiJulius was base jumping with a large group when his parachute tore immediately after jumping off a clf. In footage captured by himself, Johnni can be seen losing control and hitting the edge of the clf moments after jumping off. As his leg bends backwards, he struggles to regain his balance and soars down the clf in an unstable manner. Johnni mutters to himself in fear, before saying: “I’ve shredded my f****** canopy. For a while, he smoothly glides in the air, but soon crashes into another part of the clf with force as his parachute gives out.He hangs on tightly to the edge and hoists himself up to recover from the traumatic ordeal.Sharing the clip on Instagram, Johnni wrote: “I was hesitant to show this, but I fortunately walked away with no injuries.“I was the last jumper on a  person party load. One of the biggest fears is a  degree turn when your parachute opens. “Things like body position, pack job or wind can cause these. “After I opened, I grabbed my toggles but didn’t turn it away in time. “When I finally fought it off the wall, I looked up and saw five of my seven cells were ripped.  “I couldn’t steer and was shocked it was still flying. “I lost too much altitude fighting off the wall, and since I couldn’t steer with a ripped canopy, I knew I wasn’t going to make it out the talus. “I hit the second clf and got hung up. At this point I knew I was not injured but wasn’t sureanyone saw me because I was the last to go. “After about an hour holding onto the side of the clf, I finally climbed down and hiked back out.”  Luckily, Johnni walked away with no injuries. The video has been viewed more than , times and has racked up more than , likes. “Damn bro, glad you’re okay,” one person commented. Another viewer wrote: “Dude glad you are ok. A scene of a horror movie. Thank God.” “Holy s***,” someone  said. One viewer commented: Damn…staying calm and collected probably saved your le. This s*** was wild.” “My boy lives to jump another day! Love ya brother,” another person added.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"craignish boat jumble sails back","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

NowA TV series will feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

league, like Linlithgow Rose, but certainly not in East Lothian.“It is all about seeing the other clubs improving all the time and we want to be part of it.“As well as having got the SFA licence last year, this was the next step for the board.“A lot of our fans cannot stand for two hours and hopefully this adds to a really strong following we have got this season.”Eve Coaches, which is the club’s shirt sponsor, has also agreed a -year sponsorship deal on the new stand.The season is due to come to an end on May , when Dunbar head for Tynecastle, but Mr Robertson revealed there were already

Federation , fears that the proposals will hamper efforts to help smokers kick their habit, as well as hit trade in local shops.He said that potential curbs on displaying vaping products in stores would be “bad news” for the campaign to make the region smoke-free and healthier.Mr Brown, a Musselburgh resident, is also concerned the proposals would hit his business and is supporting calls for them to be dropped.A consultation on tightening rules around the advertising and promotion of vaping products includes a move to outlaw in-store promotional displays.The SGF is arguing that any such ban risks setting back the health agenda by “hiding a proven route for smokers to quit”.While SGF members, including Mr Brown, sell both cigarettes and e-cigarettes, they say that they are committed to playing their part in improving health outcomes by reducing tobacco sales and replacing them with sales of vapour products.He said: “From both a business and public health point of view, restricting vaping products makes absolutely no sense.“These need to be visible in-store so that retailers can help customers to find the right kind of product.“The marketing and the display of vapes go together to help raise awareness of these products.“If we are serious about achieving a tobacco-free generation then we must recognise the important role vaping can play.”SGF is urging shopkeepers across Edinburgh and the Lothians to make their views known to the Government by responding to its consultation, which closes on April .Dr John Lee, SGF head of public affairs, claimed: “The proposal to ban the in-store promotion of vaping products is bad news for the drive to make Scotland smoke-free by .“It’s also potentially harmful for the local economy by financially penalising the region’s convenience stores, whose staff do a fantastic job serving their communities and are committed to selling vaping products responsibly.”In the Scottish Government’s online consultation, Maree Todd MSP, Minister for Public Health, Women’s Health and Sport, stated: “While we continue to work towards addressing historic trends of high smoking rates, we are aware that technological and cultural advancements can bring about new public health concerns.“The emergence of vaping products, including electronic cigarettes, as an alternative to tobacco is one such concern.“The full impact of their long-term use is not yet known and could have a negative impact on public health in years to come.“Reducing exposure to the advertising and promotion of vape products is the best way to protect non-smokers, young people and children from being enticed to experiment with these products.“Vaping products should only be used as a tool to help people stop smoking tobacco. They are not a lestyle accessory.”Access the consultation at gov.scot publications tight ening-rules-advertising-promoting-vaping-products-consultation-paper- pages

This confirms that the timber has been grown in sustainable forests where young trees are replanted to replace the mature trees as they’re harvested.This is particularly important with hardwoods – unfortunately, there are still foreign governments who allow their rainforests to be cleared without replacing the trees that are so important for our global environment.Being a natural, organic material, part of the beauty of timber is seeing it mature. It will absorb water when it rains and dry out when the sun shines and the fibres of the timber will change, expanding and contracting as moisture levels y.Customers often worry when they see this movement but it is natural and what you’re seeing is simply part of the ageing process that all living organisms undergo. If it doesn’t affect the structural integrity of your furniture, there’s no cause for concern!The lespan of timber furniture ies greatly. Some pine benches may last a few years whilst a good teak piece can last in excess of  years. As with all furniture, much will depend on how you care for it, ensuring it doesn’t sit for prolonged periods in water, protecting it from the worst of the elements, especially over winter.Treating wooden furniture is often an aesthetic choice, whilst many customers prefer to see the timber mature naturally.Metal FurnitureAmongst the most common metals used in garden furniture are cast iron, stainless steel and aluminium. Whilst each metal may y in quality , you’ll generally find that cast iron is cheapest, with aluminium the most expensive.Cast iron tends to be very heavy and has a ‘chunky’ look, reminiscent of lovely old-fashioned garden furniture. Its weight makes it very stable in the garden but it does require maintenance to prevent corrosion as that could eventually weaken the structure.Stainless steel is lighter than cast iron and is valued for its strength, robustness, durability and resistance to corrosion. It’s often used as the frame of the furniture rather than the finished, outer coat.Although generally the most expensive, aluminium is an ideal metal for garden furniture. Lightweight, strong, robust and long-lasting, it withstands the elements well and requires minimal maintenance.Rattan or wicker FurnitureSynthetic rattan or wicker has overtaken the use of their natural equivalents because they are longer-lasting, easier to maintain and available in a wide range of colours, textures and shapes.There’s an enormous iation in quality and price but a quick look at the warranty is usually a good initial indication of what you’re being offered.Another factor affecting the price of rattan furniture is the size and shape of the weave.There are three main profiles – flat, half-round and round – with the flat generally being cheapest and the round being dearest.Depending on the look you want, the half-round and round profile will offer texture and depth to your furniture, whilst the flat weave offers a smoother, more even surface.Rattan can fade and deteriorate from the UV rays in the sunlight and the UV warranty of the product is also an important indication of quality.WarrantyNow you’ve chosen your perfect furniture, take a moment to check how the manufacturer recommends you care for your furniture – it is an investment and certainly worth taking care of!Remember that furniture can be made from a combination of materials and each component – for example, the frame and cushions – are likely to have dferent warranties.Finally…In this column we’re only able to offer a quick overview of some of the things to look for when choosing your garden furniture, but staff in reputable garden centres will be able to advise you in more detail and help you choose the best solution for you and your family.The internet is a handy way to start considering your options and indeed you’re very welcome to have a preview of our garden furniture online at merryhattonHowever, we strongly recommend that you always see the products in-store to get a feel for the comfort and quality before buying.That’s the best way to make an informed choice – and avoid an expensive mistake!More information is available at merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"three-venues-confirmed-covid-booster-jags","story":"The vaccination will be available by appointment to those aged  and over, immunosuppressed people and those living in care homes.People will be invited as they become eligible from about  weeks after their last booster.Musselburgh Primary Care Centre is open from .am to .pm, Monday to Friday, and vaccinations will be given by appointment only.Haddington’s Corn Exchange is open for vaccinations – appointment or drop-in – also between .am and .pm, Monday to Friday.A drop-in service is available to those aged  and over who require first or second Covid jags or a first booster.Children aged -

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park. Bring a spade and glovesyou can.Happy tree planting."},{"url":null,"title":"inflation-rate-uk---calculate-impacts-2022","story":"The Office for National Statisticssaid Consumer Prices Index  inflation rose to .% in February, up from .% in January and again reaching the highest level since March , when it stood at .%.The rise was higher than expected and followed price increases on food, clothing and footwear and a range of products and services.Energy costs are set to rise in April and due to the war in Ukraine, gas prices are also seeing a rise with the number likely to increase again before the end of the year.: Why is inflation so high in the UK  - What happens when inflation rises: Inflation surges as cost of living crisis escalates - what it means for youIf you’re wondering what this inflation means for you and your household costs, the Office for National Statisticsoffers a calculator on its website that estimates how much you have been affected by the cost of living increasing.The calculator allows you to identy which items are increasing your cost of living the most and it gives an estimate of how much your monthly spending has risen in the past year as well as compare this to previous years.To find out more about the calculator, you can visit the ONS website here."},{"url":null,"title":"glastonbury-festival-ticket-resale-coach-ticket-packages-go-sale-today","story":"Thanks to the pandemic, the largest greenfield festival in the world was cancelled in  and , but it is back this year, running at Worthy Farm in Pilton from June  to .Coach  Ticket Packages will be going on resale from pm on Thursday .Headliners on the Pyramid Stage this year are Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar, while the Sunday afternoon legend slot will be filled by Diana Ross.Weve just announced the  acts on the longlist of our  Emerging Talent Competition!

And Helen Logan, who played Lena’s manager Dorothy Solomon, offered a delicious duplicity without ever resorting to stereotype.That’s not to say this was the perfect bioplay. The first half reveals more than its share of exposition, the thick Biro’d history notes not only emerging from the Hughie Green character but from Victor, who seemed omnipresent on stage.There could have been tightening of the time Lena’s mum, and to an extent her dad, spent on stage performing. And perhapsthe early years material were reduced, we would have come to learn more of Lena’s travails in the showbiz world, and understand why Lena Zaoni’s later years were so ignominious, If all goes to plan, and it goes on to tour, this production is singing out for a new set design.Butthis play is a Firth of Clyde water tester as to the touring potential of a Lena Zaoni show it was an undoubted success.The first half’s warm, funny moments proved it could relight not only warm nostalgic memories but those of incredible talent. And the second half was dark and powerful enough to firm up the dramatic narrative, with a searing indictment of the showbiz world that cares about balance sheets far more than the balance of the human mind.The standing ovation more than suggests that Lena will live on for many years to come. Audiences can sense this a powerful story with which Tim Whitnall is well on track to have a major hit.The plan is that the show will tour next year – don’t miss it."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use.

I am excited.“I don’t know how it will go. Age is just a number –I am feeling fit… I saw John O’Shea and Robbie Keane play at the ages they were.“Every chance is big to play for your country at major tournaments. It would be daft to say, ‘No, I wouldn’t want to be a part of it.’ It’s about me keeping myself right – but I don’t know where I’ll be when I am . You just made me feel old, cheers for that.“But you never say never. I’ve seen players play until they are , , , . If I am still at a good level and playing well, you never know. But I don’t have a crystal ball.”In the shorter term, Ireland will concentrate on their forthcoming Nations League and Euro  campaigns, preparations for which start in earnest this week with Saturday’s friendly against world number one side Belgium.Stephen Kenny’s men missed out on qualication for this winter’s World Cup finals, but a team based on a blend of youth and experience has made strides in the last year and Duffy is confident better fortunes lie ahead.Asked what would represent success, he said: “I think we can go well in the Nations League. I think we can win the group – and that’s not me speaking ahead of ourselves.“The way we are going and the belief that we have, I think we can go win it. I think that would be a successful start, and go on from there.“For me, that is what we have to start believing and aiming for as a country – that we can win groups and qualy for tournaments.“And why not  You can see the progression we are making now. When we had a dficult start, we always said the young players would benefit from that and we are seeing that now. We are picking up results.“Hopefully we can win the Nations League and have a good qualication campaign and set the standard for ourselves and give the whole nation a buzz.”"},{"url":null,"title":"saqib-mahmood-admits-seeing-team-mates-ready-field-spurred-last-wicket-duo  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.

I might never see another one’.”And sadly, he never did.Read More‘I’ve found the whole perception over death from Covid disrespectful – Basil was my brother, people have been so dismissive of his death’Most ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest CoronavirusSchools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCovid-: Less than % of young kids in NI vaccinated as health professor warns of ‘serious’ long Covid riskLisa SmythOpinionTwo years on and the world is still living under the shadow of CovidWhat are the Deltacron and Stealth Omicron strains as Covid cases rise in Northern Ireland LatestRescued Victorian-era rainfall data rewrites UK weather recordsVet service to give £, for every mention of The Power Of The Dog at OscarsUkraine can ‘certainly win’ in the face of Russian aggression – PM‘It changed me forever’: London cabbie leads taxi convoy to transport refugeesUkrainian couple describe escape from ‘real hell’ of Mariupol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When the ambulance drove off, little did we know there would be no contact with her again.“Roberta couldn’t even go to the funeral because she was still in hospital fighting for her le.“Sandra was left to organise everything because Roberta was so sick.

Credit: Zivica KerkezLisa SmythTwitterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s Children’s Commissioner has said she believes some primary schools are too afraid to promote the Covid- vaccine to parents.Koulla Yiasouma said she is aware of cases where staff in secondary schools endured “awful intimidation and harassment” after students were given information on the Covid- vaccine.As a result, Ms Yiasouma, who has herself received abuse for her comments on teenagers receiving the vaccine, said she does not blame any schools that do not want to become involved vaccination programme.And she also said she does not envy parents who are trying to decide whether to vaccinate their young children against the virus.It comes after it emerged that less than % of children aged between five and  in Northern Ireland have received a Covid- vaccine.In December, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrecommended that the vaccine be offered to five to -year-olds deemed at particular risk from the virus and those who live with someone who is immunocompromised.Then, in February, it recommended that the programme could be extended to all children in the age group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, only , doses of the vaccine have been administered to children between the ages of five and .Ms Yiasouma said: “I think there are a number of issues at play here and I’m not sure safety is the biggest concern.“The Public Health Agencyhas put quite a lot of information on the safety of the vaccines on its website, but I think it would be betterit was being made more available to parents.“There are questions over the benefits of the vaccine to children and parents might not see the point in going to the trouble of finding out more.“It’s not even as though the vaccine is being administered in the school setting, parents have to go and make an appointment themselves, yet they aren’t clear about the benefits of the vaccine.“What I’m also hearing from parents is that they aren’t sure about giving the vaccine to their child simply for the benefit of the community.“We are seeing children getting it where there is a vulnerable family member but where that isn’t the case, there is more hesitancy from parents.“I don’t envy parents having to make the decision and I wouldn’t say they should or shouldn’t.“What I would advise is that they read up all the information from the PHA and make their own decision.”The Department of Health has acknowledged the low uptake in children between the ages of five and  and said the PHA has been working with a range of organisations to increase the number of doses administered in the age group.These include the health trusts and Education Authority, however, Ms Yiasouma said schools are reticent to become involved in the delivery of the programme. She explained: “I spoke to secondary schools where staff were threatened, there was awful intimidation and harassment, which I think has made primary schools very, very reluctant to be seen promoting the vaccine.”Ms Yiasouma also said there is a perception that a younger child having to isolate after testing positive and missing a week of school is not as harmful as when it happens to teenagers preparing for exams.However, she warned that children in primary one and two have suffered substantial harm as a result of the pandemic.“They have missed out on the preparation to ensure they are ready for school and we’re seeing them coming in and they don’t have the language skills or other skills required,” she continued.“Aside from children with special educational needs, who suffered the most harm throughout the pandemic, it is those children at the start of the school career that we’re most worried about.”Rachel Spiers, Immunisation and Vaccination Programme Manager at the PHA, on Thursday night said vaccination remains “one of the most important things” parents can do to protect children against ill-health.“Evenyour child has already had Covid-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease, as we have seen that it can be possible to develop Covid- more than once,” she explained.While most children aged five to  will have mild diseasethey contract Covid-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days.“Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group,” said Ms Spiers“It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. “When you look at the risk of Covid- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthMore On Department of Health‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedUkraine President Zelensky accepts invitation to address Irish ParliamentFresh calls for urgent increase in mileage expenses for domiciliary health workersCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and , new cases recordedAdoption Bill which puts children at centre of decision-making reaches ‘signicant’ milestoneMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Range of legislation passed in final hours of Assembly mandate‘Palpable anger’ among police officers over payStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesStormont to probe PO sackings after ferry chief admits they broke the lawLatestAmy Schumer says she is ‘not nervous’ about hosting this year’s OscarsQueen’s -year reign praised as William and Kate begin Bahamas visitRescued Victorian-era rainfall data rewrites UK weather recordsVet service to give £, for every mention of The Power Of The Dog at OscarsUkraine can ‘certainly win’ in the face of Russian aggression – PM,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PresseyeGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Department for Infrastructurehas been strongly criticised for building a second park-and-ride facility on the outskirts of Londonderry in breach of planning conditions.The River Faughan Anglersgroup spoke out after Stormont’s Public AccountsCommittee said in a scathing report that it was “alarmed and appalled” at the abysmal performance of, and lack of transparency in, the planning system.In August , the DfI park-and-ride facility beside the A bridge over the River Faughan was damaged by flooding.Cars were swept into the river and people were rescued from the rising waters.It was then discovered it was operating without planning permission or environmental assessments.This was because what permission it had was temporary, and a condition required the facility’s removal and the restoration of the site by , a full year before the flooding struck. In effect, DfI was breaching its planning permission.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up While the site is no longer operational, RFA said the department is still in breach because the facility was meant to be removed and the site restored by .In , DfI submitted an application for a new park-and-ride facility that opened on the edge of Drumahoe in August last year.RFA believes this facility should be rendered “unauthorised” because it is in breach of a planning condition which required it to submit additional environmental information to the planning authority and to have this agreed before any works commenced.RFA director Dean Blackwood said the department charged with upholding the integrity and credibility of the planning system continued to demonstrate why citizens had absolutely no trust in its ability to do so.“Expert consultees such as the Northern Ireland Environment Agencyand Shared Environmental Services, whose input into environmental planning matters is essential, both declined to provide that input because of the department’s unauthorised actions, which rendered the planning condition meaningless and ineffective,” he added.“While the department might seek to play down its unauthorised actions by claiming its dedicated environmental team was on site and did not raise any concern, that is contradicted by the fact that during construction works, RFA filmed an pollution incident on the Faughan on August , , coming from works associated with the park-and-ride.”Mr Blackwood also claimed it had proved dficult to get answers or an acknowledgement of mistakes.“That it took nine Assembly questions from Rachel Woods MLA, tabled over a period of more than a year, to elicit an admission from the minister that her department did, in fact, start work in breach of its planning condition, suggests to me that the public service principles of openness and transparency hold little value in this department,” he said.The DfI accepted it had powers and s that enabled it to monitor the operation of planning matters and to oversee and secure the implementation of regional policy and good practices.However, it claimed that the responsibility to do so ultimately rested with councils, and it did not want to interfere.Compliance with any planning application is the responsibility of the relevant council, the DfI also claimed.A spokesperson said the department did not take a decision to “intentionally commence works” before the required environmental information was agreed by the council.“The facility has been operational since July . In addition, the NIEA, along with the department’s consulting advisors and dedicated environmental team, were on site extensively during construction,” they added.“During this period, they did not raise any concern or issues relating to either the environmental controls or working methods adopted.”The local council confirmed it was aware of an alleged breach of conditions.A spokeswoman said: “A report of an alleged pollution incident was received. The council engaged with the DfI, the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and NIEA officials on the matter.”Related topicsDepartment for InfrastructureNorthern Ireland AssemblyRachel WoodsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - More On Department for InfrastructurePlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’ in Northern IrelandBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayNorthern Ireland taxi journeys set for further increase following last year’s .% rise in maximum faresCareless driving set to become £ fixed penalty notice offence in Northern IrelandMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandSchools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabsWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Range of legislation passed in final hours of Assembly mandate‘Palpable anger’ among police officers over payStormont to probe PO sackings after ferry chief admits they broke the lawLatestAmy Schumer says she is ‘not nervous’ about hosting this year’s OscarsQueen’s -year reign praised as William and Kate begin Bahamas visitRescued Victorian-era rainfall data rewrites UK weather recordsVet service to give £, for every mention of The Power Of The Dog at OscarsUkraine can ‘certainly win’ in the face of Russian aggression – PM,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSDLP’s Pat Catney joins in the celebrations singing along with campaigners, friends and family after Period Poverty Bill passes on Thursday .March   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDon’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.It’s a motto on getting things done, striking when the iron’s hot, being proactive rather than reactive. There are a number of slogans.Anyone who has been following the frantic goings-on in the Assembly can only assume our MLAs have finally heard them. Either that or there’s an election coming up. You decide.Then again, considering what’s being done today, could it not have been done yesterday Looking at the raft of bills flowing through the chamber these past few weeks, particularly related to education, perhaps MLAs have adopted the trait of the typical student. Last-minute cramming ahead of the summer exams.With the Assembly about to wrap up its current mandate, and elections due on May , a new to-do list will emerge. Whether a great big tick can be placed beside what needs to be done, depending on whether an Executive can get up and running, is unknown, butpast experience is anything to go by, in five years there’ll be another rush of last-minute legislation.There was a to-do list five years ago. Yes, Covid will have curtailed progress on some major issues, but the reality is that MLAs have had five years of scratching their Private Members# Bills.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up You do wonder where the urgency was in . Did the itching start so suddenly at the beginning of  Instead, there has been an extensive list of bills being rushed through, some under accelerated passage which, of course, would not have been needed had the process started earlier in the mandate. And rushed legislation isn’t always for the best. Some things need y consideration.Perhaps the biggest, and certainly the most contested, was the Integrated Education Bill from Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, which took six years of work to get to the Assembly.But in the last few weeks there has been the Flexible School Starting Age Bill, a bill to introduce CPR training as a formal part of the NI curriculum which was finally adopted as a ministerial directive, a bill on providing period products, a bill on removing the teacher exemption from fair employment legislation, and a bill to grant the Education Minister powers to dissolve the dysal General Teaching Council. That’s just within one department.And you could say, as MLAs reach the end of their five-year stint at Stormont, it’s election rush hour.In the space of a few hours, legislation on the free availability of period products, hospital car parking charges, domestic abuse safe leave from employment, the preservation of documents relating to historical institutions, safe access zones for abortion services and the fair employment of teachers were all speeding past in a blur.Sighs of relief for those who have worked to get their bills through for Royal Ascent, but maybe they made things a little harder for themselves than they needed to. Every Assembly mandate starts with the best intentions. The next one will be no dferent.While we should at least be grateful that important decisions are being made, it does all arrive with a little regret that the achievements were not being celebrated by cheering MLAs some time ago.Perhaps we should have elections more oftenwe want to get things done  Now there’s a worrying thought, but it is amazing what can be achieved when the spirit moves you.As elected MLAs reassemble, in whatever form of government the election brings come May, it would be refreshing to see the enthusiasm and the urgency to actually get things done that have been a hallmark of the final days of the current crop, bear fruit in the early days of a new administration.Last-minute winners can be more enjoyable and they do say all good things come to those who wait, but there are vital things Northern Ireland simply shouldn’t have to wait for.Related topicsMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongMore On Michelle McIlveenPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Education Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealed£m for new school buildings plannedMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest PoliticsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisNorthern Ireland set for #problems and confusion# over a clash between UK and EU law, Government admits‘These people have no idea what struggling families are going through’: Northern Ireland mum hits out at Chancellor’s Spring statementSpring statement: ‘Nowhere near good enough...’ Chancellor Rishi Sunak gets a cool reception in Northern IrelandLatestAmy Schumer says she is ‘not nervous’ about hosting this year’s OscarsQueen’s -year reign praised as William and Kate begin Bahamas visitRescued Victorian-era rainfall data rewrites UK weather recordsVet service to give £, for every mention of The Power Of The Dog at OscarsUkraine can ‘certainly win’ in the face of Russian aggression – PM,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

The treatment so far has already taken a toll on his body and, in Alanrsquos case, it is not having the outcome the medics had hoped for, she said.ldquoWersquove found it really dficult watching Alan go through all of this and not being able to be with him.ldquoThe distance between us back home and him in New Zealand feels even greater and we are desperate to see him again.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

That has now happened, and Mr Allister deserves much credit for helping to bring it about. However, paintings now on display permanently include republican leaders who were central to the violence that led to Ireland securing independence from Britain a century ago.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Welcoming the emergence of such an image, Mr Allister said: “Why a portrait of the man who allegedly ordered the murder, Michael Collins, is just round the corner from where Sir Henry Wilson’s now hangs is less easy to determine.” That is to put it mildly. It is entirely wrong that there is painting of Collins on display or one of Eamon de Valera. These are men who wanted to destroy the very concept of a Northern Ireland. Mr de Valera continued after NI was agreed to try to shatter the deal that had led to partition.Many people will defend the permanent display of such men at Stormont on grounds of parity of esteem. But it is more than that — it is the latest subtle attempt to interpret equality to mean nothing has primacy in NI, not even the symbols of the country that was created, Northern Ireland, or of the state in which it was to stay, the UK, or the people who fought or led for the fact of such a place on this island.While the Republic of Ireland proudly celebrates its history and does not display unionist leaders on a par with its own founders, NI has to behave dferently and let nationalists think that the principle of consent, leading to UK sovereignty here, is a fact of le without consequences.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now SF can control Stormont decision makingYour Morning View yesterday  is a wake-up call. It could be construed as making a laudable case for scrapping Stormont now. In stating “we have a dysal government in which a party that wants NI to fail knows it has to be in office at all times and is allowed to behave as you would expect a party with such aspirations to behave”, the implied criticism is clearly directed at Sinn Fein.  \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Phoney and absurd because minority rule dictates that Sinn Fein has an unchallenged ability to control Executive decision making. It is unworkable when government revolves around the approval of a party dedicated to destroying the influence of the majority pro-union community and undermining its very existence.People have had their fill of the hard won peace from terrorism being disturbed by political upheaval. They have had enough of being denied normality and the harvest of social, economic and political stability.The union itself might be safe but unionist tolerance of interference in Northern Ireland’s internal affairs by Dublin, Brussels and Joe Biden’s Washington has worn thin. The relentless orchestrated pressure on the UK over matters such the NI Protocol and legacy is in fact part of the campaign to “get the Brits out of Ireland” that is being played on Sinn Fein fiddles.Time to remind them and London also that Northern Ireland is not in, and is not a part of, Ireland.Time, therefore, with an election forthcoming, for unionists to decide do they want to negotiate new devolved arrangements or walk clean away from the battering ram of the intransigent Irish republican agenda.David McNarry, Ex UUP and Ukip MLA, ComberThe scrapping of Stormont in  set the tone for London’s approach to Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Even though the devolved government was led by a thoughtful and progressive unionist leader, Brian Faulkner, that was not good enough for London.

One such moment came a year before, in March , with the murder of three Scottish soldiers, lured to the prospect of a party, at a time when squaddies were still relaxed about their security. Prior to those ‘honeytrap’ slayings the total numbers of Troubles killings was . Within  months of the murder of the young military trio, more than  people would have lost their lives. It helped cement the breach between soldiers and a nationalist population that had initially welcomed them.Direct rule set the tone for the UK approach to Northern Ireland ever since. One of general weakness in the face of the long IRA terror campaign, and towards Irish governments.Having said that, the first  years of Westminster control were overseen by both Tory and Labour governments that were robust on security and constitutional matters, compared to the time after the  Anglo Irish Agreement betrayal. It set in motion a timid approach towards Irish interference in NI affairs, something that with ministers such as Simon Coveney is at its highest levels since the s.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Savage and unprovoked sectarian attack’ on -year-old boy condemnedJoint unionist anger as energy VAT cut is denied for Northern Ireland due to ProtocolJim Allister defends travel rules for crossing borderDetectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year Most PopularSofas UK : best sofas and couches, and how to pick the best for your home, from velvet, leather, to budgetNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -years of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy Tenof the best Mother’s Day afternoon teas from UK supermarkets and online stores to treat mum toLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis week’s confirmation that the United Kingdom and Ireland have launched a bid to host Euro  means that Duffy and his team-mates may yet have a chance of doing just that after missing out on doing so at the re-arranged  finals, when they failed to qualy and then saw Dublin stripped of its involvement as a result of Covid- restrictions.The Brighton defender will be  when  comes around and while he admits he does not know what will happen between now and then, he is hoping he is still on the scene.Duffy said: “In football we’re not naive, especially with the younger ones coming through. I am excited.“I don’t know how it will go. Age is just a number –I am feeling fit… I saw John O’Shea and Robbie Keane play at the ages they were.“Every chance is big to play for your country at major tournaments. It would be daft to say, ‘No, I wouldn’t want to be a part of it.’ It’s about me keeping myself right – but I don’t know where I’ll be when I am . You just made me feel old, cheers for that.“But you never say never. I’ve seen players play until they are , , , . If I am still at a good level and playing well, you never know. But I don’t have a crystal ball.”In the shorter term, Ireland will concentrate on their forthcoming Nations League and Euro  campaigns, preparations for which start in earnest this week with Saturday’s friendly against world number one side Belgium.Stephen Kenny’s men missed out on qualication for this winter’s World Cup finals, but a team based on a blend of youth and experience has made strides in the last year and Duffy is confident better fortunes lie ahead.Asked what would represent success, he said: “I think we can go well in the Nations League. I think we can win the group – and that’s not me speaking ahead of ourselves.“The way we are going and the belief that we have, I think we can go win it. I think that would be a successful start, and go on from there..remove“For me, that is what we have to start believing and aiming for as a country – that we can win groups and qualy for tournaments.“And why not  You can see the progression we are making now. When we had a dficult start, we always said the young players would benefit from that and we are seeing that now. We are picking up results.“Hopefully we can win the Nations League and have a good qualication campaign and set the standard for ourselves and give the whole nation a buzz.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Shane Duffy holding on to hope of home Euro finals with Republic of Ireland article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It was good fun out there with Leachy, it was a case of being disciplined out there and hitting the bad ball. We knew they’d get to a stage where the sting was taken out of their attack. vw,vw,px, px\"Jack Leach helped England recover “It could have easily fallen into pieces after the start we had in the first two sessions but we stuck at it well.”Mahmood was in buoyant mood after his unexpected role with the bat, which included a first six in red-ball cricket..removeRecalling the sweet strike off Kyle Mayers, who had earlier taken two wickets for no runs in his first five overs, he said: “A one stage I faced  or  balls without getting a run, then I got dropped and I just thought ‘I’m gonna take this guy down’.“Those words may have been said a couple of times. If you hear me in the dressing room I’ll always talk myself up as a batter, but when you come into this environment and you’ve got guys bowling -kph you tend to go quiet a little bit.“But it would have been nice to get . I got a bit of tunnel vision and probably took my eye off the ball.”West Indies quick Jayden Seales admitted his side were disappointed to see England get out of jail after almost throwing the game away in the first two sessions.A remarkable day in Grenada.📉 From   with all front-line batters gone.📈 To  all out with No.  and  the top scorers.#WTC | #WIvENG https:t.co KduRSqgL— ICCMarch , “It was definitely frustrating.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A key element of the Review was to gain insights from interested stakeholders and the wider public on the future of rail on the island of Ireland. With over , responses to the consultation, both Ministers received an update from consultants ARUP on the initial findings from this phase of the Review at a progress meeting today.  Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy. The benefits of enhanced rail connections cross Ireland will improve lives and have signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our environment. I believe that this is our chance to deliver real and lasting change. I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review. The incredible public response has shown the importance of rail for regional accessibility and demonstrated wide support for sustainable public transport. The public and stakeholders’ ambitions for the future of passenger and freight rail transport will play a signicant role in the future work of the Review, informing concepts to enhance the rail network and, in doing so, enhance connectivity, drive decarbonisation and support sustainable social and economic development. “Minister Mallon and I are committed to increasing low-carbon mobility and regional accessibility. Through rail we can sustainably enhance connectivity to improve the quality of le for all citizens on the island of Ireland.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edddedcedbafcafab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbcddbfcbaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1648027003458.jpg--ministers_welcome_report_aimed_at_producing_a_21st_century_high_street.jpg?164802700600","title":"ministers welcome report aimed at producing a st century high street ","story":"Junior Ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney have welcomed the publication of the Executive’s High Street Task Force report ‘Delivering a st Century High Street’, along with its  recommendations. The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edddedcedbafcafab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbcddbfcbaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1640789015225.jpg--pcr_testing_to_come_to_an_end_for_most_people_from_next_month.jpg?164078901500","title":"pcr testing to come to an end for most people from next month ","story":"Testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to the COVID- pandemic over the coming months, Health Minister Robin Swann has emphasised. The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aecfcbcbabec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebfdbbcbdbeefdcdbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
