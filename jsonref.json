And there is no point in pretending.\u0027It would hurt more to pretend I had nothing to do with him.\u0027She said, as a teenager, John used to jam with his future bandmates Paul McCartney and George Harrison in the kitchen of their family home.As he plucked the strings, she and her sister Jackie, John\u0027s other half-sister, danced to Elvis and skiffle.Their mother Julia even taught John to play her mother-of-pearl backed banjo, she said.Julia believes John was \u0027truly himself\u0027 when he was at home practising guitar in the kitchen - which she says is where the magic of The Beatles was born.

The project was conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a memorial to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.It is intended to \u0027remind every inidual of our great nation\u0027s freedom struggle\u0027 and to \u0027inspire the people of our country to inculcate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\u0027s visionary ideologies of unity, patriotism, inclusive growth and good governance,\u0027 the Statue of Unity website reads. \u0027This monument will not just be a mute memorial like the rest, but a fully functional, purpose-serving tribute that will spur all round socio-economic development, in the form of better connectivity, healthcare and education infrastructure, research centre for agriculture development and various tribal development initiatives.\u0027 However, many have criticised the project for being a waste of money and some political parties have argued the expenditure for the statue should have gone towards other priorities like women\u0027s safety, education and agricultural schemes. Vishal Shah wrote on YouTube in response to a promotional video: \u0027This is ridiculous project, what would we achieve from it?\u0027 While Surya Vanka mused: \u0027Besides being an enormous waste of resources, this is a rather tasteless and gaudy project.\u0027Others feel the project is an important reminder of the nation\u0027s past when Patel united the 565 semi-autonomous states and British-era colonial provinces to form a united India.Patel led the Indian National Congress which forged the Indian movement for independence, following World War II when the party put pressure on the British government to pass an independence bill in July 1947.The party declared that India would not support the war until it had been granted complete independence.In January 1950 India’s constitution as an independent state took effect.            Construction workers move tonnes of cement and steel. The statue is a mixture of concrete and steel framework for the core, covered by an exterior cladding of bronze          Chinese workers finish for the day after working on the statue\u0027s construction.

Friends of the senator said he wanted the service held at three locations: Arizona, the National Cathedral in Washington and Annapolis, Maryland. Sources said that McCain had requested that George W Bush and Barack Obama deliver the eulogies at his funeral.  Two family members reiterated to CNN on Saturday that Trump won’t be present at the service.    McCain deliberately left Trump off the invite list for the memorial service he and his family have been planning for months, according to sources familiar with the arrangements          The late Arizona senator slammed the president on Twitter last month, calling his performance at the Helsinki Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u0027disappointing, yet not surprising\u0027Trump and McCain’s bad blood stems back to June 2015 when Trump announced he was running for president and called Mexican immigrants ‘rapists’ and drug runners during a speech.McCain distanced himself from the future-president saying in an interview that he disagreed with Trump’s comment. Trump fired back by calling McCain ‘incompetent’ during a July 2015 rally at the Phoenix Convention Center.The back and forth banter continued for the next two years, as Trump repeatedly launched public attacks – often times on Twitter – at McCain. In a 2016 tweet Trump slammed the senator as ‘foul mouthed’ and in a 2017 post he lashed out at McCain for voting against the Affordable Care Act.‘3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!’ he wrote.At one point during the two politician’s bitter feud, Trump mocked McCain’s record as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War saying that McCain was only labeled a hero ‘because he was captured’ and he liked ‘people that weren’t captured’.For his part, McCain publicly criticized Trump on numerous occasions. In a July statement, McCain lashed out at the president after Trump said during a meeting in Helsinki with Russian president Vladimir Putin that he accepted Russia’s claim that that they did not meddle in the US presidential election.McCain said of Trump’s comments: ‘No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant’.      Trump was spotted arriving at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Sunday morning less than 17 hours after news broke of McCain\u0027s passing"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/00/4F6725E700000578-0-image-m-89_1535239553947.jpg","title":"PM bangs drum post Brexit Britain heads Africa","story":"    The PM (pictured at church in her Maidenhead constituency today) is taking a business delegation to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya on a whirlwind three-day tourTheresa May will bang the drum for post-Brexit Britain this week as she heads for Africa in a bid to boost trade ties.The Prime Minister is taking a business delegation to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya on a whirlwind three-day tour.Amid mounting pressure over the deadlock in negotiations with the EU, Mrs May insisted the the trip demonstrates the UK\u0027s \u0027ambition\u0027 on the global stage.It is the first visit by a British PM to sub-Saharan Africa since 2013 - and no premier has been to Kenya in 30 years.

Pre-decimalisation (until 1971), pennies were still in circulation that dated back to the 1860s in Victoria’s reign.In a tradition that ended years ago, babies born on the same day as a future monarch were given a silver penny struck with the year of their birth. This was seen as a way of wishing them health — and wealth — for their whole life.Under the Coinage Act 1971, the 1p coin is legal tender for amounts only up to 20p. So shopkeepers don’t have to accept the sale if you offer 21 pennies or more. An Essex mother, Laura Pulley, fell foul of this law when she wasn’t allowed on a bus because she tried to pay the 60p fare in 1p and 2p coins. (The 20p limit applies to 2p pieces, too). Three years earlier, in 2012, an accountant sued a difficult client who tried to pay an £804 debt in coppers — and won.Baffling pensions are incomprehensible for ordinary savers...Biggest Roman villa to ever be discovered in Britain dating...Share this articleAccording to the Royal Mint, there are 11.278 billion pennies in circulation and 6.557 billion 2ps.Millions of pounds-worth of pennies must be lying down the back of sofas or stashed in piggy banks — but not as much as the estimated £169 million of old pound coins believed still to be abandoned there .Production of 1p and 2p coins by the Royal Mint has fallen sharply, with 288 million minted in 2016-17 compared with around 500 million the year before. Even so, that’s still more than nine pennies made every second.          Pennies last, on average, for more than 40 years, according to the Royal Mint, which monitors how many are damaged or lostSince 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales. Previously, the Mint was in the City of London — originally at the Tower of London. The words ‘mint’ and ‘money’ come from the Roman goddess, Juno Moneta, the ine protector of money.The pre-decimal penny was originally minted in silver and got smaller as silver’s price rose. When silver became too expensive, in 1797, pennies began to be minted in copper by Matthew Boulton at his Soho Mint, Birmingham. A penny’s worth of copper was in each coin, which was significantly bigger than its silver predecessors. Because of their thick rims, they were called ‘cartwheels’. After 1860, the penny was minted in bronze (97 per cent copper, 2.5 per cent zinc and 0.5 per cent tin).At the start of decimalisation in 1971, the new penny was one of three new copper coins, along with the half-penny and the 2p piece. To avoid confusion with the old coins, all had the word ‘NEW’. This was removed in 1982.In the early-Nineties, copper prices soared — making bronze too expensive. Indeed, the coins were worth up to 1.5p — more than the value of the coin itself. Scrap dealers could make money by illegally melting them down. So, in 1992, the first copper-plated steel pennies were introduced. The steel core makes them magnetic. For security reasons, the Royal Mint won’t disclose today how much it costs to make a penny.          The Bank of England\u0027s says if the penny were scrapped and retailers rounded up prices to the nearest 5p, it would create hardly any inflation — just 0.07 per centSince 1971, there have been four different portraits of the Queen on the ‘obverse’ side of the coin (above). They are by artists Arnold Machin (1971-84), Raphael Maklouf (1985-97), Ian Rank-Broadley (1998-2015) and Jody Clark (2015 to date).The ‘reverse’ side has had two designers: Christopher Ironside (from 1971 to 2008) and Matthew Dent (from 2008 to date). Dent’s penny features a fragment of the Royal Shield. When placed together with the 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins, the penny’s design completes the full shield. The earlier Ironside design (right) was a version of the Badge of Henry VII, now the Badge of the Palace of Westminster: a crowned portcullis with chains.On all pennies since 1971, the inscription is ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D. plus the year the coin was minted. The initials are short for Dei Gratia Regina Fidei Defensatrix — Latin for ‘Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith’.          Since 1975, all British coins have been made at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, WalesWhen referring to a group of the coins, it’s right to call them ‘pennies’. But when talking about them in monetary terms, they’re called ‘pence’ — as in ‘two pounds and 30 pence’. To say ‘one p’ is regarded as poor English — it should be one penny.There were 240 pre-decimal pennies to the pound, with 12 pennies to a shilling and 20 shillings to a pound.The pre-decimal penny was abbreviated to ‘d’ (as in 1d, 2d etc). The ‘d’ was taken from the Roman silver coin, the denarius — from the Latin ‘deni’ (‘containing ten’), because there were ten asses (another Roman coin) to the denarius.The ‘d’ combined to make ‘L.S.D.’. The L. stood for libra, Latin for ‘pound’, as in weight — which is where we get our pounds from, both in weight and currency. The S. stood for solidus, a Roman gold coin.Edward VIII was on the throne for such a short time before he abdicated in 1936 that only a few Edward VIII pennies exist. In fact, they are so-called pattern coins, produced to receive official approval. They are dated 1937, the year after the Abdication. They show the king’s preferred left profile — breaking the convention that monarchs changed the direction of the previous monarch. Edward VIII’s vanity is thought to have brought bad luck and, in turn, the Abdication.The British penny was introduced by Offa, King of Mercia, in the mid-8th century AD. They were called denarii, after the Romans practice.Anglo-Saxon silver pennies had considerable buying power, the equivalent of £20 today. Back then, five pennies could buy a sheep, ten pennies a pig, 20 a cow and 30 an ox.The value of the penny has been driven down by inflation. A pre-decimal penny’s buying power was equivalent to 6p today. In 1951, it would be worth 13p today. In 1901, a penny was worth the equivalent of 46p today.          In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwillIn the Sixties, a cigarette could be bought for a penny. In 1840, a stamp — the Penny Black — could be purchased for a penny. These days, a strip of six Penny Blacks can sell for £250,000 and a second-class stamp costs 56p.The penny and a ‘pennyworth’ are mentioned 15 times in Shakespeare’s works. In Henry IV, Part 2, the magistrate Robert Shallow says: ‘A friend in the court is better than a penny in the purse.’It cost a penny to watch the Bard’s plays at the Globe Theatre as a ‘groundling’ — standing on the ground rather than seated. These groundlings were mockingly called ‘penny-stinkers’.Canada got rid of ‘pennies’ in 2012, when it cost more to produce the coin than they were worth. To stop people cashing on the change and causing inflation, retail prices were rounded down or up to the nearest five-cent figure. The Canadian Government saved £6 million a year by the change.In New Zealand, they stopped making their cent and two-cent pieces in 1990. Many retailers rounded down prices to the nearest 5c as a gesture of goodwill."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/27/10/4F6F2A6A00000578-6101589-image-m-25_1535361819858.jpg","title":"Car ploughs shop window Londons West End","story":"    Four people have been injured after a car being chased by police through London\u0027s West End ploughed into a pedestrian at a bus stop          Eyewitnesses revealed how the car smashed through a shop window after hitting the pedestrian, after which police officers restrained those inside          A member of the public and three people inside the car were rushed to hospital for treatment shortly after the crash at 4.30am this morning\u0027The car was being pursued by police at the time of the collision.

U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick (left) resigned amid allegations of misconduct which former Vatican ambassador Carlo Maria Vigano (right) has claimed that the Pope knew about But he claims he was surprised to find McCarrick back on Church missions after Francis became pope in 2013, although the claim that Benedict sanctioned him is disputed.  It comes after the Vatican was blasted for its response to a Pennsylvania grand jury report which found more than 300 priests had abused children over 70 years. Barry Coburn, McCarrick\u0027s civil attorney, said the allegations in the Vigano letter are \u0027serious\u0027.\u0027Archbishop McCarrick, like any other person, has a right to due process.

He devoted his entire life to his country.\u0027Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country salutes McCain as a \u0027great American patriot and a great supporter of Israel.\u0027Netanyahu says Sunday he is deeply saddened by McCain\u0027s passing at the age of 81 and will always treasure his friendship.McCain was a frequent visitor to Israel who backed it in the Senate and strongly opposed the nuclear ambitions and militancy of its archrival Iran.Netanyahu says McCain\u0027s \u0027support for Israel never wavered. It sprang from his belief in democracy and freedom.\u0027Other tributes poured in from across the Israeli political spectrum. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called McCain one of Israel\u0027s greatest friends.

Friends of the senator said he wanted the service held at three locations: Arizona, the National Cathedral in Washington and Annapolis, Maryland. Sources said that McCain had requested that George W Bush and Barack Obama deliver the eulogies at his funeral.  Two family members reiterated to CNN on Saturday that Trump won’t be present at the service.    McCain deliberately left Trump off the invite list for the memorial service he and his family have been planning for months, according to sources familiar with the arrangements          The late Arizona senator slammed the president on Twitter last month, calling his performance at the Helsinki Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u0027disappointing, yet not surprising\u0027Trump and McCain’s bad blood stems back to June 2015 when Trump announced he was running for president and called Mexican immigrants ‘rapists’ and drug runners during a speech.McCain distanced himself from the future-president saying in an interview that he disagreed with Trump’s comment. Trump fired back by calling McCain ‘incompetent’ during a July 2015 rally at the Phoenix Convention Center.The back and forth banter continued for the next two years, as Trump repeatedly launched public attacks – often times on Twitter – at McCain. In a 2016 tweet Trump slammed the senator as ‘foul mouthed’ and in a 2017 post he lashed out at McCain for voting against the Affordable Care Act.‘3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!’ he wrote.At one point during the two politician’s bitter feud, Trump mocked McCain’s record as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War saying that McCain was only labeled a hero ‘because he was captured’ and he liked ‘people that weren’t captured’.For his part, McCain publicly criticized Trump on numerous occasions. In a July statement, McCain lashed out at the president after Trump said during a meeting in Helsinki with Russian president Vladimir Putin that he accepted Russia’s claim that that they did not meddle in the US presidential election.McCain said of Trump’s comments: ‘No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant’.      Trump was spotted arriving at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Sunday morning less than 17 hours after news broke of McCain\u0027s passing"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/18/4F68526500000578-0-image-a-16_1535304143980.jpg","title":"Man ate chicken chips finally tucking fruit veg","story":"Ryan Howarth suffers from a rare food disorder which meant his diet was staggeringly limited from the age of four (pictured left as a youngster and right today)          Ryan\u0027s mother Christiane, 45, has been helping him overcome his food fears and try new things\u0027I just ate the foods I wanted to,\u0027 said Ryan.\u0027When someone asked me to eat something else I reacted in the same way most people would react if I asked them to eat an exotic food, like insects.\u0027Ryan, from Andover in Hants, said his family were worried his diet could cause him health problems later in life.One in 4 people are waiting more than a WEEK for a GP...Why sleep really is the best medicine: Neuroscientist...Share this articleBut after undergoing some sessions with a therapist, he can eat almost anything.\u0027Now I\u0027m eating so many different things,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s amazing how I am enjoying foods I never expected I would like.\u0027          Ryan, from Andover in Hants, with his mother Christiane.

Attoh is half-Dutch on her mother’s side, half-Ghanaian on her father’s, and identifies as mixed-race. Born in the UK, she spent most of the first 23 years of her life in Accra and Amsterdam, shuttling between cities and cultures, an experience she found enlightening but problematic. “On the one hand it allows you to develop a different understanding of the world,” she says of her duality. “But there’s still a lot of ignorance in society. People perceive you as either black or white, and you’re not – you’re mixed.”Working in London, Attoh heard similar stories from other mixed-race people, and soon she began publishing her images online (at mixedracefaces and on Instagram) alongside small texts that allowed her subjects to share personal thoughts on identity, race and self, something they couldn’t do elsewhere. Following the death of her mother, to whom the series is dedicated, the project helped Attoh dissect her own multiracial experience – what it means to be connected to two worlds at once, and how society perceives that condition – but it has also sparked an open forum on ersity. “It’s not a topic people usually talk about,” Attoh says. “So the website has become a platform for people with mixed heritage. It’s given a lot of them a sense of belonging.”When she was starting out, friends and family corralled subjects for Attoh to shoot. (She is indebted to her family, she says, for the work they’ve contributed for free: the space in which the portraits are taken is co-run by her son the 90 or so hour-long interviews were transcribed by her daughter-in-law, often late at night.) Now subjects, keen to share their personal histories, approach Attoh directly, and she notices themes reoccurring. Many subjects celebrate the benefit of being able to flit between cultures while embracing both. Others talk of the strain inherent in not being of one place – of being from neither here nor there, tugged between one identity and another. Some find it easy, others less so.Attoh has now taken more than 90 images, a selection of which are published here. Those photographed represent great portions of the world – Japan, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sweden, Iran, China, South Africa – but also provide a portrait of contemporary Britain. In the 2011 census 1.25 million people identified as mixed race, making it the fastest-growing ethnic group in the UK. “A mixed-race girl just married a prince!” says Attoh. But discrimination persists. “It’s 2018, and mixed-race people are still asked the question, ‘Where are you really from?’”Later this year Attoh will organise an exhibition of the photos she’s made so far. In the meantime she’ll turn her lens on subjects in Holland, to examine differences in the mixed-race experience. But mostly her project is meant to raise public awareness. “I’m hoping it will become a platform for wider discussion,” Attoh says. “To help people understand these different points of view, these different experiences.”I grew up in Moscow until I was about nine and then we moved to the UK. I feel Russian, really. I speak Russian at home. Culturally I don’t have any real Korean connections if anything, I feel more British than North Korean. When I was younger I didn’t want to be Asian at all I was embarrassed by it. It doesn’t bother me now, but then I alternated between thinking it was something interesting about myself and hating the fact that I looked different. I really wanted to have lighter hair.I’m Irish on my dad’s side, mixed Jamaican and Indian on my mum’s. There are times I feel like the odd one out, especially at family functions. You’ll see a sea of white faces, and then there’s me and my brother. It can be isolating there aren’t many people I can relate to. In my adult years I’ve learned to appreciate where I come from. I can’t tell people I’m one race because I’d be disrespecting the other. I try to maintain the balance.I was born and raised in San Francisco. My mother is Colombian and my dad is mixed Scottish and English. They met on a blind date 14 days later they were married. When I was little I was very dark, but when I turned seven I became very fair. There was an awkward time when people thought my mum was my nanny. Because I was so light-skinned I would embrace being English rather than being Colombian. My son is a blond-haired, blue-eyed child, but I want him to know he is mixed Colombian.I was born in London but lived in Mexico until I was eight because of my disability – I was born deaf. I went to live with my grandmother in a small village. We had a pet donkey called Jesús. We also had chickens, pigs, goats, you name it. It was a great childhood. But in school in Mexico, I was always seen as being different. In Mexico people call each other by nicknames. My family’s nickname was ‘Japonicitos’ – Japanese. In Mexico they’d never really seen an Oriental person before, apart from what they’d seen on TV, on Dragon Ball Z.I’ve spent my whole life in England so I’ve always identified as British. My mother is half-Jamaican and half-Indian my dad is half-English and half-Irish. I appreciated visiting people on both sides of the family each time I could learn and experience different and unique things about the cultures I was connected to: food, music, traditions, stories. It was interesting to hear from those who spoke patois, while others spoke with London accents. Though sometimes the middle ground felt like a lonely place.I’m a teacher, I spend a lot of time with younger people, and I’m hearing so many younger mixed-race people interrogating what they call their ‘privilege theory’. What are their privileges as a light-skinned person? How does their status relate to that of their darker-skinned friends, or people who look more African or more European? It’s a hell of a thing to navigate, and I think there’s a pressure on younger people to understand it. But your identity can be about many things. It doesn’t have to be just about race. It could be about being a parent, a cyclist, a musician.Dad and Mum met in Lesotho. Dad worked for NGOs. I was born in Wales, but I didn’t live in the UK until I was 13. When we were young we lived in many countries: Ghana, Uganda, Mali, Kenya. I loved the food in Ghana. Even for a mixed-race person I’m quite fair, so until I was 13 I thought of myself as white (every African country has a word for ‘white person’.) When I came to the UK I was told I was black. It highlighted a lot about race: how so much of your identity is what other people put on you.My mum’s family are from Cyprus. My dad’s family are Jamaican, with African heritage. But I grew up in northwest London. When I was the president of the African Caribbean Society at university, one of my friends who ran the society with me told me I wasn’t really black because I had a white mum. I think from that point onwards I’ve always referred to myself as black – very intentionally. I stand in solidarity with all black people. I don’t think being mixed makes me any less black. Whiteness is set up to exclude all those who are not white."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11d48d026f645db943c6278f7b77526f5d7fc6f8/232_1971_7487_4491/master/7487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020d3a12d9bbfb903c2fcaa9de491cd7","title":"helsinki amos rex art museum","story":"In a vast expanse beneath the Finnish capital lies a soaring circus-top culture hub. Will the €50m Amos Rex art museum put the city at the forefront of Europe’s art scene?Bulging white mounds rear up out of the ground in the middle of Helsinki, tapering to circular windows that point like cyclopean eyes around the square. Children scramble up the steep slopes while a skateboarder attempts to glide down one, past a couple posing for a selfie at the summit.This curious landscape of humps and funnels signals the arrival of Amos Rex, a €50m (£45m) art museum for the Finnish capital, which opens this week in a vast subterranean space that was once a bus station parking lot.“It is as if the museum didn’t quite agree to go underground,” says Asmo Jaaksi of local architecture firm JKMM, which masterminded the project, “and it’s somehow bubbling up into the square.”It is a suitably truculent metaphor for this forthright city, which in 2016 turned down the prospect of having its own Guggenheim Museum, after five years of bitterly contested public debates. While the Guggenheim’s mooted harbour-front location remains empty (earmarked as a potential site for a new architecture and design museum, announced last week), the opening of the privately funded Amos Rex adds convincing weight to the argument that Helsinki is a world-class cultural destination in its own right, without the need for a branch of the US franchise.Beneath the lumpy landscape stretches a gargantuan 2,200 sq m flexible exhibition space (almost twice the size of the V\u0026ampA’s new underground gallery), which has been cleverly excavated in the centre of town, between a former army barracks and the Lasipalatsi, or glass palace, a 1930s entertainment and retail complex. This glory of Finnish functionalism has been immaculately restored, with timewarp interiors of fleshy salmon columns, a sweeping spiral staircase and spherical glass light fittings that dangle like clumps of frogspawn from bright red and blue ceilings. Its 500-seat cinema is a wonder of the period, with chrome-edged red upholstered seats, flying saucer lamps and pleated mustard-coloured curtains. Outside, the building’s former boilerhouse chimney stands proudly in the centre of the new square with a nautical air, like the funnel of a ship now cast adrift in the churning sea of paved mounds.Designed by three radical young architects when they were still students, the Lasipalatsi was intended to be temporary, giving them a freer rein to let rip and allowing them to incorporate such details as first outdoor neon sign in Finland. Eighty years on, the streamlined white building provides a stylish foil to the futuristic underworld that JKMM has concocted.Entering off the city’s main Mannerheimintie avenue, visitors are greeted with a big picture window that frames one of the new mounds in the square beyond before descending down a broad staircase to a bright white foyer. The ceiling is covered with spirals of white illuminated fabric that gently throb, giving the impression of being beneath some ethereal cloud canopy (a welcome sight in Helsinki’s dark winter months), while two great conical voids plunge down from the piazza, framing views of surrounding buildings through their circular windows. It is a world apart from the former home of the Amos Anderson Art Museum, founded on the legacy of the property speculator turned media mogul and patron of the arts in his former newspaper offices in 1965.“Art used to be something you hung on the wall and went respectfully to contemplate,” says the museum’s director, Kai Kartio. “Today it is increasingly interactive and conversational, something people make and experience together. We realised that if we wanted to meet the challenges of the future, we had to have something different from our charming old office building.”It is an odd decision to launch an airy top-lit gallery with a black-box installation, but the interactive, hi-tech bonanza promises to be a crowd-puller. Featuring 140 projectors, and an entire room of supercomputers and servers, the series of hypnotic environments transports you to another realm. A “digital ecosystem” of butterflies, frogs and geckos multiplies around one mirrored labyrinthine space, the psychedelic jungle responding to visitors’ movements. Kids can draw animals, scan them and have them added to the fairytale forest some will delight in chasing these creatures around and stamping on them to release digital splatters of paint. Stand still for long enough and bunches of flowers begin to bloom at your feet, mingling with the technicolour flotsam of pulverised bugs.Elsewhere you can marvel at a flock of Yatagarasu, the three-legged crows of Japanese myth, as they glide around an infinitely black room at nauseous speeds, weaving neon vapour-trails in knotted loops to the sound of trance music. The crescendo comes in the biggest room of all, where the team of programmers has simulated a biblical flood of water gushing up from the ground and spiralling around the conical ceiling in a great vortex, as if the whole building had been tipped upside down, the roof-light transformed into a monumental plughole.After all this digital wizardry, the small room dedicated to a permanent exhibition of post-impressionist paintings seems like an afterthought, tucked into a low-ceilinged windowless space – something the architects had to include but didn’t quite know how.The large column-free hangar has become the default desire for most new museum extensions – but it so often ends up being compartmentalised and blacked out. It will be interesting to see how Amos Rex’s next two exhibitions, ning the erse poles of surrealist painter René Magritte and experimental Dutch art collective Studio Drift, make use of the great concrete tent.Up above, more families are clambering on the mounds and peering in through the windows to get a glimpse inside their new cultural bunker. The architects hope their sloping landscape will become a spontaneous auditorium for outdoor concerts and events, but even without any performances it has already become a magnet of activity in the middle of the city, whose oversized squares often feel a bit windswept.

Terri Apter is a shrewd psychologist and her book The Sister Knot covers the subject of sibling rivalry: “She’s got the red spade and you said I could have that!”As well as being a highly original thinker, Adam Phillips writes in Winnicott with elegance and a keen sympathy about one of the great analysts of children, Donald Winnicott, who brought his powerful intuition and understanding to the subject of mother and child, as “the nursing couple”. Phillips also shares Winnicott’s rare feeling (among psychoanalysts) for poetry.Mansfield Park is perhaps Jane Austen’s least loved novel, but in my view it is possibly her best for its depiction of the upper-middle-class neglect suffered by Maria and Julia, the spoilt Bertram girls this in turn leads to their failure to make happy marriages. The novel also adumbrates something that is often overlooked but reads to me like a pre-Freudian grasp of the allure of incest: Fanny, the book’s principal, falls in love with Edmund, the cousin she grows up with, and ultimately he with her (an idea I borrowed for my own novel, Cousins).Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons is not exactly realism, but the Starkadder family, with their hysterical self-dramatising, are the protagonists in one of the funniest books I know about family life.William Maxwell is a monstrously underrated American writer whose Time Will Darken It describes with excruciating psychological deftness the disintegration of a marriage brought about by a man’s unquenchable need to please and be seen as amiable to a set of distant relatives who once helped his father. The arrival of the relations for an extended visit brings nemesis in the shape of an ardent young woman who falls for her host, causing a lasting rupture in a formerly happy marriage.The irony is that the object of her affections by no means falls for her but his fear of being disobliging overrides his care for his own and his wife’s happiness. A stark reminder that charity begins at home.William Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale is a terrifying study in the irrational power of jealousy. For those who call it a redemptive play I can only point out that Mamillius, the young son of the jealous Leontes, is killed by the despair brought on by his father’s unjust accusation of adultery by his mother, Hermione.Finally, I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith. The eccentric Mortmain family, who reside in a crumbing ruin of a castle, is “captured” by the precious but innocent narrator, 17-year-old Cassandra: her father, author of a bestseller but now suffering 18 years of writer’s block her stepmother Topaz, engagingly dotty and warm-hearted the beautiful but greedy elder daughter, Rose and the intellectual younger brother, Thomas. All are drawn with clarity, affection and a sharp psychology that is both funny and profound.• Salley Vickers’s novel The Librarian is published by Viking.

Its identical twin, Voyager 2, had a 16-day head start on their grand tour of the outer planets. Each had a computing system with about one-millionth of the capacity and capability of a modern smartphone. The Voyager missions were designed to take advantage of a planetary conjunction that happens once every 175 years when Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are on the same side of the sun. A spacecraft launched at the right time could visit all of them in turn, using the gravity of each planet as a slingshot to make it to the next.Travelling at a million miles a day, the duo completed the grand tour in 1989. Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space in August 2012 and is heading towards a star called AC+79 3888. Some 17.6 light years from Earth, Voyager 1 should swing past it in about 40,000 years.In the course of its long journey, Voyager 1 has become an icon of modern science. It is an instrument and exemplar of human curiosity that represents the joy of exploring what is beyond the horizon and beneath the surface of things, says the journalist Tim Radford in his engaging and delightful new book, The Consolations of Physics. When he feels desolate at the behaviour of others and the world around him, rather than reach for another glass of wine, Radford thinks of Voyager and derives a measure of consolation, a quantum of solace “that humans are also capable of selfless co-operation in pursuit of unearthly satisfactions”.In Radford’s persuasive and genial company, as he roams from the initial singularity to dark energy, from Saint Augustine’s City of God to Dante’s The Divine Comedy, from the Higgs boson to the multiverse, it’s hard not to be moved by the fact that there are those who are capable of dreaming up and executing complex undertakings that explore the order that underpins creation. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern near Geneva is another that Radford, a former science editor of the , has chosen to highlight in this self-confessed “love letter to physics”.The LHC is designed to probe the ultimate nature of matter. Quantum mechanics is the best theory we have for capturing the goings-on in the sub-atomic realm where particles can be “virtual” because they have a fleeting, ghostly existence measured in terms of a Planck second, a subision of the second so small that it’s impossible to imagine. Named after Max Planck, who discovered the quantum, it is 10-43 of a second or 10 million trillion trillion trillionths of a second.The Planck second measures the rate at which things happen in the quantum world. An instant after the big bang, the universe was smaller than an atom, so quantum mechanics comes into play and it is possible that space and time, just like virtual particles, pop out of nothing. A period of accelerated expansion within the first millionth of a second after the big bang inflated the baby universe from a subatomic speck to the size of a beach ball. This cosmic inflation, explains Radford, lasted for only 10-37 of a second, but shaped the evolution of the universe. While the LHC interrogates the nature of matter, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) monitors the fabric of space-time itself, in search of something that Radford first heard of as a young reporter 40 years ago: gravity waves.Ligo is actually two identical detectors some 3,000 kilometres apart – one in Hanford, Washington, the other in Livingston, Louisiana – so that each instrument can confirm the other’s data. Ligo uses laser beams fired along 4km-long vacuum pipes and reflected from mirrors at each end to detect distortions in space-time so sensitive that instruments can register a shift of less than one-thousandth of the diameter of the nucleus of an atom.The first gravity wave was detected on 14 September 2015. It was produced some 1.3bn years ago as two black holes spiralled around each other creating ripples in space-time that propagated with the speed of light. When the two black holes merged into one, a tsunami of gravitational waves was generated.All major scientific projects represent a collective attempt to answer specific questions, Radford says. These are parts of a much larger set of questions: where did the universe come from? Where did we come from? Why are things as they are?Human ideas will endure for as long as humanity endures. Voyager announces “we were here”, and the gold-plated record it carries has greetings in 55 languages, the music of Mozart and Chuck Berry and much else. Long after we are gone and forgotten, Voyager will be humanity’s message in a bottle.Manjit Kumar is the author of Quantum• The Consolations of Physics: Why the Wonders of the Universe Can Make You Happy by Tim Radford is published by Sceptre (£14.99).

Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

But there is a way forwardThe autumn is coming, though it might be better to adopt American English, and think of it as the fall: out of the languid, heady days of summer, and back into the dysfunctional, Groundhog Day-esque deadlock that currently passes for national politics. Conference season will be here in a few weeks’ time. The Conservatives will talk in delusional terms about Brexit, and a lot of what they say will be viewed through the prism of a supposedly looming leadership contest. Labour will also smooth over the realities of leaving the EU, presumably continue to be dogged by evidence of antisemitism – which clearly runs much deeper and higher than some people would have us believe – and possibly have a minor factional scrap about its so-called democracy review.Meanwhile, many people will wonder why there is such little interest in an array of massively important subjects. Labour is bound to sound off about the condition of the country more than the Tories, but even so, on both sides the no-shows will be obvious. Even after a summer that has flagged the realities of a warming planet in no end of vivid ways, there will probably be precious little attention paid to climate change. No one is likely to speak convincingly about how to radically change a benefits system that is broken beyond repair nor about a schools system that is increasingly unfit for the future. The profound challenges presented by an ageing population will be skirted over, at best. The fact that councils are now colliding with bankruptcy might be mentioned, but is unlikely to lead to any deep discussion of how to change our system of local government.These omissions are partly to do with the way Brexit has sidelined debate about anything else, but the sense of absence runs deeper, into the online spaces in which politics now plays out. There, the modern ide between right and left is reducible to two tribes in a constant state of excitation, stoked by whatever is today’s controversy, and usually in no mood for anything that might unsettle their core convictions. Each camp tends to comb the culture for anything suspect, and then explode.This has grim consequences, not least for our collective sense of priorities. An example: some people may have missed it, but last week brought news that the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has started to break up. But on my Twitter timeline, there was much more interest in the controversy that had been kicked off shortly before by the Labour frontbencher Dawn Butler, when she admonished Jamie Oliver for the “appropriation from Jamaica” embodied by his new brand of “jerk rice”. The furore that followed was essentially a massed wrestling bout conducted by the same participants as ever: a flimsy replay of the burqa controversy Boris Johnson had triggered a couple of weeks before.If these episodes sometimes have the surreal feel of things pulled into the real world from fiction, it is perhaps not surprising that the best book about British politics I have read in some time is a just-published novel. Perfidious Albion is the second book by the 39-year-old Sam Byers, whose keen sense of his time has echoes of Martin Amis and Jonathan Coe. His story is a fusion of Brexit, the Twittersphere and “opinion” websites, and the all-pervading power of a tech company called Green. What burns from its pages is a vivid picture of how much politics has been uncoupled from the nitty-gritty, and floated off into an orbit all its own.In the Albion of the title, the politicians who succeed are the ones who can surf waves of online controversy and market themselves as being “barely a politician at all”. Meanwhile, for all their passion, many people who are involved in politics are in constant danger of losing any grasp of reality. When the couple at the heart of the story sit down to dinner, a nightly ritual ensues: “While they ate, they talked about the day’s events on the web, asking each other if they’d seen this or that post, tracked this or that social media shitstorm, or caught a glimpse of whatever eye-rolling thinkpiece was currently whipping up derision across right-thinking networks.” One of them finds fame on an “opinion” platform called The Command Line, where his editor instructs him in the art of provocation for provocation’s sake : “You’re nobody until somebody really hates you … And now someone really hates you, I think it’s fair to say you’re finally really somebody, no?”The key event happens when a female character responds to Bennington’s complaints about the supposed oppression of white men with the sarcastic hashtag #whitemalegenocide. With the help of a far-right group called Brute Force, Bennington whips up the resulting controversy into a major political episode that breaks out of social media and starts to define events on the street. It all gives rise to a lot of noise, but changes nothing. As with the best zeitgeisty fiction, the story describes events that could happen tomorrow, and conveys a sense that we are moving at speed from one world into another.To use a word endlessly parroted online, our new political culture has superseded the dominance of what some people call “centrism”. To the extent that the latter was eventually defined by callow, fortysomething white men and such disasters as the Iraq war and the financial crash, its time was deservedly up. A new centrist party is an assuredly terrible idea. But quite a few babies have been thrown out with the bathwater. The word’s etymology is questionable, and to use it retrospectively seems crass, but such trifles as the welfare state and the postwar education system were basically the work of centrists. More recently, so were Sure Start, the minimum wage and equal marriage. These things required planning, coalition-building and a willingness to listen to an array of opinions. The kind of shrill belligerence that now defines debate would probably have killed them before anyone even got started.One big tension defines where British politics has arrived. On both sides, there are a lot of people – from no-deal Brexiteers to the Corbyn hardcore – who seem to think that they are the custodians of their own variety of purity. What we are perhaps discovering is that this mindset may actually deliver the reverse: a polluted politics in which even people in positions of power keep very questionable company, debate tends to look like an indecipherable mess, and the biggest casualty is a national conversation that feels in any way useful.Until that changes, politics will suggest so much irrelevance, not least to the millions of voters for whom the online whirl is another planet. Perfidious, according to the Oxford dictionary, means “deceitful and untrustworthy”: an appropriate description not just of modern England, but of the politics it has spawned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c9f010695f9600d2a0115eade85271f89a61983/725_250_869_521/master/869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c1bd95196604472687c05b2c80fa80c","title":"la vie en rose nows the time to rethink pink in pictures","story":"Pink just grew up.

Although the grande dame of the French New Wave, it’s now at the age of 90, and with the superb Faces Places, that her legacy is being fully rediscovered. A touring cinema programme and a Curzon Home release of some of her early work is bringing her to wider attention.Varda’s later-life documentaries are personal and playful, an older woman looking back at a life of curiosity amid major social change. The Gleaners and I (2000), in which she riffs on the traditional French idea of those who scavenge after harvests, gets all the attention. For me, it’s The Beaches of Agnès (2008) that’s the magical one.In it, Varda reflects on her love of seaside locations, and uses the beaches of her youth as a backdrop for restaging memories of love and loss while playing games and pondering creativity. Mixing archive clips, observational material, constructed fantastical sequences and to-camera reminiscences, she roams the country, musing on interesting random encounters. One moment she’s sailing down the Seine the next, she’s walking around dressed as a potato in her own art exhibition. It could be twee, this national treasure having fun with her memories. But Varda is sharp and no pushover. She has strong opinions on being an artist, on feminism, on the need for culture-makers to depict the working class with dignity, and on the importance of film-makers and artists being part of social change.There are moments of profound mournfulness, such as her reflections on the death in 1990 of her husband, Jacques Demy. Himself a great film-maker, here Demy plays second fiddle to Varda, whose body of work, I would argue, far surpasses his in ambition, crossing fiction and documentary lines with abandon, getting the mix of joy, pain and weirdness just right. Varda’s love for discovering more about the lives of ignored people is the basis of Faces Places, her Oscar-nominated documentary made with JR, the French muralist and photographer who is 65 years her junior. These years don’t prevent a visible bond of creativity and cheekiness: Varda’s the fun youthful one he’s the grumpy one hiding behind sunglasses. She and JR travel through rural France, taking photos of and filming the people they meet, and creating giant prints of their faces, which are pasted on their houses or on other public buildings. The prints echo her 1981 mural documentary, Mur Murs.Faces Places is typical of Varda’s interests – public art, hidden stories, digressions, jaunty animals – but the presence of Instagram star JR places them in a social media context and underlines how ahead of her time she was. She understood memes years ago – the fascination with heart-shaped potatoes in The Gleaners and I is very now – and Faces Places is a riposte to celebrity culture, promoting “ordinary” people as photographic subjects.The Gleaners and I becomes a deeply political film, widening the term “gleaner” to include those who subsist on the detritus of wasteful capitalist production, including squatters. Varda exposes vintage vineyards where grapes are left to rotto maintain a specific production quota of wines even though local people are desperate to use them. Her politics come from finding out about people through simply talking to them and being interested in what they say, which sounds radical in the modern context of social media filter bubbles.It’s an approach she showcased decades earlier in Daguerréotypes, in which she trails a power cable from her house to allow her to film the shopkeepers, artisans and residents of her street, Rue Daguerre in Paris. Varda has stayed up to date on technology and Faces Places has mobile tech running through it. This isn’t what makes her such a relevant documentary-maker, however. The technology is a tool for her lifelong interest in what gets her closest to her people. In a talk last month at the BFI she said: “Sometimes, I feel the success I have is when I meet people in the streets and instead of ‘bravo’, they say ‘thank you’.” That is Agnès Varda all over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc80f8b34058d551b6c5277251dabf5bfdf92e4/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584165ef1e67236b4f67492714f0c995","title":"biggest films of autumn 2018","story":"There are heists aplenty, scores to settle, Lady Gaga becomes a star, farewells to Sam Shepard and Harry Dean Stanton, and democracy meets its PeterlooDirector: Desiree AkhavanDesiree Akhavan is the US film-maker who got noticed with her New York-set satire Appropriate Behaviour.

Moretz plays Cameron Post, a teenaged orphan in small-town 90s America who is caught kissing the prom queen.

Bart Layton’s new film is based on the true story of a bunch of students who, in 2003, got it into their heads to steal rare books from a university library in Kentucky. The participants are played by actors but the real people themselves are interviewed, documentary-style, to put the action into context but also to question what really happened. 7 September Dir: Jon M ChuBased on the colossal bestseller by Kevin Kwan, this blingtastic comedy boasts an almost all-Asian cast. It is the first major Hollywood film to do so since The Joy Luck Club in 1993, and has been welcomed as a boisterous corrective to a certain kind of Hollywood racism that renders Asian people invisible. It tells the Cinderella-ish story of Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), a smart, hard-working economics professor who discovers her Singaporean boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) is so mind-bendingly super-rich that it’s basically embarrassing. She has to impress his formidable mother, played by Michelle Yeoh. 14 SeptemberDir: Agnès VardaAgnès Varda ascends to a yet higher and more rarefied level of “legendary” status with her latest, Oscar-nominated movie, which she presents to the public at the age of 90. It is a docu-essay that she has co-created with the 33-year-old French photographer and graffiti artist JR, in which they travel to various villages and small towns around France and he creates monumental photos of the people they meet and plasters them on the sides of barns and buildings. It is garrulous, engaging, revealing. 21 SeptemberDir: Gaspar NoéThe adulte terrible Gaspar Noé is back, more lethally brilliant and icily provocative than ever. Or, to put it another way, more infuriating than either fans or detractors will be entirely able to handle. Climax is based (loosely) on the true story of a 90s dance troupe in France who held a party after a rehearsal, drank booze spiked with LSD and then succumbed to a sinister collective freakout. It is like a DJ set from hell, and some of the images Noé contrives are worryingly extreme. The dance moves are sometimes flailingly superhuman. 21 SeptemberDir: Bradley CooperA Star Is Born is a movie that regenerates like Doctor Who. It first appeared in 1937, then famously in 1954 as a musical with Judy Garland and James Mason, and then again in 1976 with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand. (Its story of sacrificially wounded showbiz maleness also resurfaced in more recent films such as The Artist and La La Land.) Anyway, now A Star Is Born is reborn, with Bradley Cooper directing, and playing a downwardly mobile country star who discovers a wonderfully talented singer played by Lady Gaga. 5 OctoberDir: Damien ChazelleDamien Chazelle, Hollywood’s youthful boy wonder, tackles an authentic American icon: Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. Ryan Gosling plays that Adam of US history, Corey Stoll is Buzz Aldrin, and Claire Foy plays Armstrong’s first wife, Janet Shearon. Chazelle will have his work cut out to measure up to Ron Howard’s superbly watchable space drama Apollo 13, which had Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell. (Pablo Schreiber – ­Nick Sobotka from The Wire – plays Lovell for Chazelle.) 12 OctoberDir: Matteo GarroneThis new film returns Italian director Matteo Garrone to the world of gangsterism he portrayed in his film Gomorrah. It is a compelling opera of beta-male criminal martyrdom, inspired by a true case. Marcello Fonte won a prize at Cannes for his portrayal of Marcello, who runs a dog-grooming salon in a small Italian town and deals cocaine on the side. Then one of his loyal customers, a brutish bully called Simone with a brain addled by the white powder, forces Marcello into helping him with burglaries. Gripping, horrible and tragic. 19 OctoberDir: Mike LeighWe are approaching the 200th anniversary of the 1819 Peterloo massacre, when British soldiers attacked an unarmed democracy rally of 60,000 in St Peter’s Field in Manchester: an act of aggressive folly which was to be a long-term spur to parliamentary reform and radical campaigning journalism – leading, in fact, to the creation of this newspaper, originally called the Manchester . Now Mike Leigh has written and directed a drama based on these events, with Rory Kinnear as the radical orator Henry Hunt. 2 NovemberDir: Annemarie JacirBethlehem-born film-maker Annemarie Jacir made the heartfelt and engaging drama When I Saw You, about Palestinian children in Jordanian refugee camps after the 1967 war. Now she returns with Wajib (the title translates as “Duty”), a father-son drama set in Nazareth. A young architect who lives abroad comes home to help his father with the traditional task of hand-delivering invitations to his sister’s wedding, and in the process has to sort out his own family issues. 14 SeptemberDir: James MarshThe bizarre true-crime story of the ageing London villains who pulled off an extraordinary heist in London’s Hatton Garden jewellery district in 2015 cries out for a geezer-ish Britmovie treatment. In fact, one has already been made. But now the guv’nor himself has given his imprimatur: Michael Caine stars in this new adaptation with Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent – and Ray Winstone representing the fresh-faced younger generation. 14 SeptemberDir: John Carroll LynchThe late Harry Dean Stanton made one of his final performances in this plangent and thoughtful movie from actor-turned-director John Carroll Lynch. Stanton plays the eponymous Lucky, an old man meditating on the nature of mortality, fate and life itself. Stanton’s affecting appearance is not far from his breakthrough performance in Wim Wenders’s Paris, Texas. David Lynch contributes a cameo. 14 SeptemberDir: Chloé ZhaoChloé Zhao’s The Rider is a feature that straddles the worlds of documentary and fiction a drama that uses non-professionals and draws upon their real lives. It’s an indie-realist slice of Americana, a tale of cowboys and bronco riders in South Dakota. A young rider called Brady is recovering after a bad accident – the sort of thing which has left a friend of his severely disabled. It is a gentle, slow-moving film which is in no hurry to reveal its truths: an immensely cherishable piece of work. 14 SeptemberDir: Camille ThomanSam Shepard’s final performance is to be found in this enigmatic metaphysical drama-thriller from the former documentary director and UK theatre performer Camille Thoman. Mireille Enos plays conceptual artist Miranda Hall, who is in a relationship with her agent Paul (Shepard). Her latest creation is about voyeurism and surveillance, and stems from a stranger’s smartphone that she found (unlocked) in the street. Having used the personal information in it as the basis of an exhibition, to its owner’s rage, she now wonders if she is herself being tracked. 21 SeptemberDir: Lenny AbrahamsonA ghost story of the classic English sort is on offer in this movie based on the 2009 novel by Sarah Waters, whose Fingersmith was so memorably transformed into the Korean film The Handmaiden. It is set in the pinched and austere years after the war, and country doctor Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) makes a visit to a strange, old house, where he makes the acquaintance of a young woman, Caroline (Ruth Wilson), and discovers a terrible secret. 21 SeptemberThis movie by German director Robert Schwenke, shot in stark monochrome, is based on the grisly true story of Willi Herold, a German soldier on the run from the authorities at the end of the second world war. He accidentally discovered an officer’s uniform and then brazened out his own situation by pretending to be an officer on precisely the same mission as those on his tail – and ended by executing hundreds of prisoners. A tough, bleak watch. 21 SeptemberDir. Björn RungeGlenn Close gives perhaps the best performance of her career in his hugely enjoyable black comedy. In The Wife, adapted from the novel by Meg Wolitzer, she play Joan, , the supportive wife of a world-famous author, Joe (Jonathan Pryce), whose conceited literary celebrity becomes even more insufferable when he wins the Nobel prize. Joan is a former creative-writing student of Joe’s who tells interviewers that she’s quite happy to have abandoned her own writerly aspirations and devoted herself to her husband. But that is not true. 28 SeptemberDir: Panos CosmatosHere is a film to ide audiences. Some have found it mesmeric, others unbearable. Nicolas Cage stars in this sci-fi horror, futuristic in its way, although set in 1983. Cage plays a guy whose life has been destroyed by a marauding gang of sadistic satanic cultists who have killed everyone dear to him. The spectacle of Cage set on violent revenge, with his face covered in blood, is not something to be taken lightly. 12 OctoberDir: Steve McQueenConnoisseurs of Brit crime have a place in their hearts for Widows, Lynda LaPlante’s post-Sweeney 80s TV show about the widows of a criminal gang, killed during an armed robbery, who take over their late husbands’ business. Now Steve McQueen (Hunger, 12 Years a Slave) has directed a feature film version with Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo as the widows themselves. Hopes are very high for this. 6 NovemberDir: Sebastián LelioChilean film-maker Sebastián Lelio makes his English-language debut with this intensely controlled drama. Rachel Weisz plays a young woman who has to make an uneasy homecoming with the death of her father,an Orthodox rabbi, against whose strict values she was rebelling. Now she finds things very tense with her old friends, who have embraced the religious conservatism she rejected. 30 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eac2c3b39024f3b87bcae5364cd2ab8a855cbf0/0_141_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccaf3e92b05bff09604c2ebe7b30b5f5","title":"constance wu interview crazy rich asians ive lost parts for being outspoken","story":"The actor has been critical of Asian representation in Hollywood – even if it’s meant offending Scarlett Johansson and Matt Damon. Now her new film is set to do the talking instead Constance Wu is all alone. It’s two weeks before Crazy Rich Asians will premiere in the US and become an instant hit and the most talked-about film of the summer (a sequel has already been announced). The halls of the Beverly Wilshire are abuzz with studio staffers. But here in this suite, it is just Wu and the weight of expectations from an entire generation of Asian Americans yearning to be seen.“It’s really lonely,” says Wu as she perches cross-legged on a sofa in white and red Oscar de la Renta, her stiletto heels abandoned on the floor. “In terms of a blueprint, a model, of doing what I’m trying to do … I don’t have that. I get really scared.”It is a startling admission, because it is almost impossible to imagine Wu succumbing to that fear. Even before Crazy Rich Asians, the 36-year-old actor had already served as the linchpin for a make-it-or-break-it project for Asian American representation in Hollywood in 2015’s Fresh Off the Boat, in which she turned a “Tiger Mom”-style role into a surprisingly tender portrayal of an immigrant striver. The show, now filming its fifth season, is only the second Asian American family sitcom ever produced, and it came more than 20 years after the first, Margaret Cho’s All-American Girl, was cancelled after one season.With Crazy Rich Asians, Wu is breaking an even longer dry spell. The film is the first to tell a contemporary Asian story with Asian American lead actors since The Joy Luck Club in 1993. Wu serves the crucial dual role of romantic lead and audience surrogate, a relatable American leading us on a journey into the heart of opulence, as academic Rachel Chu, who goes to meet her boyfriend’s parents, only to discover that they are the biggest property developers in Singapore – and have very specific ideas about the kind of woman he should marry.Despite her precarious position in a very white entertainment industry, Wu has never given in to the pressure to remain apolitical. (“The ones who do that, I don’t let them represent me any more,” she says of agents and managers who want her to pipe down.)Wu never planned to become a spokeswoman for Asian American frustration. “I don’t think anything through,” she admits. “I am very impulsive and reactive. I have always been a person who is kind of outspoken, but nobody knew who I was before. Now I have this weird thing called fame, and I wasn’t looking for it, I didn’t ask for it, but if you have it, you might as well use it for something good. And the best thing I think I can do is help amplify the voices of people who don’t feel heard.”In other interviews, Wu has cited Pulitzer prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen’s theory of “narrative plenitude” to explain the importance of erse of representation in culture, but with me, she invokes a less lofty source – a famously benevolent American children’s TV star. “I think half or almost all of the pain in the world is people not feeling heard, people not feeling seen,” she says. “It’s like Mr Rogers, my hero, says: everything in the world revolves around love or the lack of it.”In fighting for Asian Americans to be seen, Wu doesn’t shy away from calling out injustice. She speaks with excitement of Sandra Oh’s recent Emmy nomination for Killing Eve, but also anger that Oh is the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a leading role. “I think that says something about who the culture thinks has a story that’s worth telling,” she says. Her outspokenness has come at a\u0026nbspcost. After calling out Affleck, “People got mad at me. I have lost a lot of parts because of that and I probably will never be a member of the Academy … But that’s OK.”When I ask what it’s like to bump into the very stars that she has criticised, she laughs. “I love Scarlett Johansson,” she says. “I’m not blaming Scarlett. She isn’t out there like, ‘Let me go choose the part that’s going to make people mad the most.’ But the only way she’ll know that she’s doing that is if we begin a conversation and say, ‘It’s not your fault, but this is something that’s important to a population.’”The benefits of talking about it are\u0026nbspclearly on display in Crazy Rich Asians, a fun romantic comedy that nevertheless had me welling up within the first 15 minutes. A scene showing thirtysomethings drinking beer and eating street food wasn’t particularly heartstring-tugging in itself – though the pangs inspired by the director Jon M Chu’s gratuitous food-porn shots were real. It was just that I had never before sat in a crowded cinema watching Asian people perform something other than martial arts, surgery, tech support or massage therapy.The movie tells a story that is not just Asian, but Asian American. Chu immediately seems foreign to her boyfriend’s Chinese-Singaporean family when she offers that most American of greetings – an over-enthusiastic hug. Later, concerns of Asian authenticity play out in tense scenes such as the one in which four generations of a family sit around a table making dumplings.The cast includes actors of Asian descent from all around the world. “We’re not a monolith,” Wu says. “I think the one thing that we all share is not being the dominant culture of the country that we grew up in, and that environmental factor affects identity and character.” Her voice rises. “And the fact that people don’t realise that is kind of ridiculous to me. It’s like, ‘Oh, you think I relate to the beautiful films that China makes simply because we have the same face? You think my culture is just how I look?’ There are so many things that go into identity.”As for her feelings of authenticity, despite having struggled with the same accusations of being an “unrefined banana” (yellow on the outside, white on the inside) that her character faces, Wu seems confident in asserting both her Asianness and her Americanness. “I grew up in a predominantly white community, so there was no question I was Asian there, you know what I mean?” she laughs. “I’ve struggled with it more since being in the public eye. There are a lot of Americanised things that I do, you know, because I am American born and raised.”Such as? “Like, I wear my shoes in\u0026nbspmy house,” she confesses. “People are like, ‘What!? You are such a bad Asian!’ And I’m like, ‘Guys, it’s part of the outfit.’”• Crazy Rich Asians is released in the UK on 14 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0781239e1d6c4af828a98c88292dd54a70f0ce26/86_64_1518_911/master/1518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75ac1a8d13c0aaf65266dd7567b4239","title":"arsenal unai emery mesut ozil","story":"The midfielder missed his team’s win over West Ham due to illness but there is growing tension between him and EmeryUnai Emery’s English is not very good. That is not a criticism but a fact and something the Spaniard freely acknowledges. If anything he deserves credit for trying hard to speak in a foreign language during these nascent days as Arsenal’s head coach but it has led to him often struggling to get a clear message across. There are times, though, when Emery expresses himself perfectly well – so long as those listening are prepared to read between the lines.Which brings us to Mesut Özil’s absence from Arsenal’s 3-1 victory against West Ham United. What should have been a moment for Emery to immerse himself in celebration of a first victory in charge of a new club in a new country has instead become dominated by talk of a rift between manager and player.Emery denied such claims on Saturday, insisting Özil was not part of his matchday squad because he had been struck by illness – catarrh, to be precise – in training a couple of days earlier and not because he had thrown a strop after being told he would be starting on the bench. That line was maintained when the 46-year-old then spoke to a small group of journalists in private surroundings, and even after it was put to him that allowing a sick person to enter the dressing room before a game, as Emery said was the case with Özil, was strange bordering on negligent. “He felt better so he is with us, and I prefer that,” the manager said and that was that. Move on. Nothing to see here.Sometimes less really is more and from that one-word answer and accompanying gesture came the definite sense that for all of Emery’s insistence otherwise there is tension between him and Özil and that, for the latter, breaking point was reached when he was told he would not be lining up as Arsenal’s principal playmaker – a No 10 in the No 10 role – in a game of genuine importance for Arsenal. According to a tweet from the ESPN journalist João Castelo-Branco, Özil “had an argument with Emery at practice and came out screaming. Information from more than one source linked to the club”.Arsenal will continue to insist that Özil’s absence at the weekend was down purely to illness but, if so, it would be the sixth time since December 2016 that the German has been sidelined for that reason. It is an astonishing statistic for a supposedly healthy athlete and naturally leads to suspicion, especially given Özil’s somewhat flaky displays for Arsenal since joining the club in September 2013 and the nature of his relationship with Emery since he arrived in May.Arsène Wenger’s successor has called on Özil to be more involved in games, started him in a wide‑right position against Manchester City on the opening day and then, having deployed the 29-year-old as a No 10 at Chelsea, hauled him off on 68 minutes. Emery insisted after the 3-2 defeat that he was pleased with Özil’s performance but only after again making a reference to his somewhat lightweight approach to proceedings. “I took him off to stop Chelsea progressing easily with the ball,” Emery said in the Stamford Bridge press room.What happens next is fascinating. Having signed a contract extension in January that increases his salary to an estimated £350,000 a week, Özil is in a strong position. But as the man brought in to lead Arsenal in the post-Wenger era, Emery is in an even stronger position and, having had to deal with the politics of Neymar at Paris Saint‑Germain, he simply may no longer be in the mood to tolerate an awkward star and certainly not one who appears an ill-fit for his high‑intensity approach. Aaron Ramsey looks a more Emery-like No 10, as seen by the way his forward sprints and aggressive pressing unsettled West Ham at the weekend.All eyes then are on Arsenal’s training sessions this week and the team Emery picks for the visit to Cardiff on Sunday. For the sake of harmony Özil may want to leave his sickbed as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deb815479f0a2576ef8df4c6497f09581a8c6d34/0_65_2289_1373/master/2289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a19549fcf747c6eae33444ef491858c3","title":"jose mourinho wants fans to lift manchester united for tottenham visit","story":"• United manager expressed his happiness at loyal support• Fans stood by club in defeat at Brighton after a poor displayJosé Mourinho wants Manchester United to be inspired by the loyal support the team received despite the disappointing 3-2 defeat at Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion last week.On Monday night United host Tottenham, who have won both their matches this season, hoping to bounce back from the shock defeat on the south coast. But though Mourinho’s side were dismal at Brighton they received a good reception from the fans, just as they did at Old Trafford for their victory in the opening match of the season – a situation their manager hopes will be repeated on Monday evening.“The supporters were fantastic in both matches. Not for me, for the team, which is the only thing that matters. In my career I was never selfish and thinking about myself, I was always a club man. That’s what I am. I am really happy when the supporters support the team.”United’s defeat against Brighton was the latest loss to a side that are not a direct competitor, following last season’s reverses to the same opposition and to Huddersfield, Newcastle and West Brom. Yet despite boasting a better record against the other top-six teams, defeating them all, Mourinho accepted that United will always be subject to criticism.“It is not a frustration because it would also be a frustration if we win every match against the non-top-six team and don’t win against the top six, that would also be a frustration,” the Portuguese said. “We want to win all the time. We want to play well all the time. We don’t want to make mistakes. That is what you always want.”United finished second last season but Mourinho would not be drawn on whether this would represent success this term. “I’m not in May,” he said. “I cannot answer to that, I am not in May – I’m in August.”He was also reluctant to detail his ideal playing style for United. “Winning style,” he said. “Don’t make defensive mistakes. Be dominant. Chances, score goals and go home with the three points.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f073974551eeb2a245de217b63008f20328bdd91/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b156fc279d819b15b1c605a63ebbb66","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Arsenal’s defence requires urgent attention Bournemouth cannot keep relying on their powers of recovery Wolves’ Rui Patricio has produced an early contender for save of the seasonArsenal’s defending against West Ham was a shambles. Their back four were constantly disconnected while the midfield in front of them offered as much protection as a piece of tissue in a storm gun fight. West Ham scored once but should have racked up more. These are, of course, early days in Unai Emery’s time at Arsenal and with a new manager comes a period of adjustment. But having conceded six goals in their opening three games of the season, there needs to be notable improvement soon – what is encouraging is the players appear aware of that, too. “When we do not have the ball we have to make fouls. Then we don’t take the counterattack,” the centre‑back Sokratis Papastathopoulos said. It may be cynical tactic but it is one that has served Manchester City well under Pep Guardiola and reflects a level of canniness that has been lacking at Arsenal for some time. Sachin Nakrani• Emery denies rift with Özil after midfielder left outAfter spending the best part of £100m on new players in the summer, three defeats from their first three matches was not what David Gold and David Sullivan had envisaged for West Ham. But despite a promising performance at the Emirates, Manuel Pellegrini’s side find themselves bottom of the pile and still looking for a first point under their new manager. There should still be grounds for optimism, however, given the impressive display of Felipe Anderson at the Emirates in his No 10 role behind Marko Arnautovic that saw him create several chances to retake the lead before Arsenal took advantage late on. Like his fellow new arrivals Andriy Yarmolenko and Lucas Pérez, the Brazilian is capable of being a match‑winnner on his dayand Pellegrini will be hopeful his forwards can make the most of his creativity sooner rather than later. Ed AaronsBournemouth have collected 20 points from losing positions in 2018 and they were at their spirited best against Everton, earning a draw from 2-0 down in the second half. But while their games are rarely dull there is a sense that Bournemouth could eventually hit a wall if they continue to concede the first goal. What happens if the comebacks are unsustainable? “It’s not something we are looking to do,” Eddie Howe said. “We are looking to take the initiative and win the game when it kicks off. That’s the type of team we are. At our best we are very front foot and very aggressive. It’s not like we are sitting back waiting to concede and then we attack. These things have happened. From my perspective, I hope they keep happening when we go behind. But I would like us to be a little bit more ruthless when it’s 0-0.” Jacob SteinbergQualifying for European football was a huge achievement for club and manager but it now threatens to endanger Burnley’s Premier League status. The time for Clarets fans to put their passports back in the drawer has arrived before the school holidays have finished. Losing 4-2 at Fulham on Sunday made it a single point from three Premier League fixtures that Sean Dyche’s team might have expected to win last season, when they spent most of the season consolidating seventh place. A small squad has been overstretched by five Europa League matches so far. At 3-1 down after Thursday’s first leg at Olympiakos, there was already a slim hope of reaching the group stage. With his club now in the bottom three, the pragmatic move would be for Dyche to rest players for Thursday’s return before Sunday’s visit from Manchester United. John BrewinVincent Tan, the Malaysian owner, can pat himself on the back after a summer of fairly frugal spending by Premier League standards, but after three matches of failing to put the ball in the back of the net, Cardiff would be foolish to think that a defensive stubbornness and an undoubted team spirit alone can keep them up. Bobby Reid and Josh Murphy have added bundles of energy but they remain toothless in attack and while Kenneth Zohore is a handful, he’s hardly a prolific goalscorer. Danny Ward and Gary Madine, too, are able but neither have scored, at any level, since January. “We believe we have enough good players to stay in the league,” Tan said, with matches against Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City on the horizon. In Neil Warnock, they do at least have a manager capable of performing miracles. Ben FisherSome Anfield patrons gave Alisson two standing ovations during the victory against Brighton that took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League. The second followed a crucial 88th-minute save from Pascal Gross that ensured Jürgen Klopp’s team took maximum points. This was only what a £65m goalkeeper is paid to do. The first was for something extra: a delicate chip over Anthony Knockaert as the Brighton winger closed down a Virgil van Dijk back-pass followed by a volleyed pass back to the Liverpool central defender. “I try my best to help the team in the buildup,” the Brazilian later said. “If sometimes there is a situation with dribbling then I do it carefully. It could be too risky, but it’s part of the game. We are a team that plays from the back with the ball on the ground. Mistakes may happen but we work hard during the week to do everything correctly during the matches.” Andy HunterThat Aleksandar Mitrovic scored as many goals in three minutes on Sunday as Newcastle have in three matches so far this season might seem like an indictment of Rafael Benítez’s judgment, yet a quietly impressive display from Salomón Rondón, cast in a thankless role against Chelsea, suggested the situation is not quite that simple. The Venezuelan said he was encouraged to join the club by Faustino Asprilla, with whom he “has things in common”. It’s fair to say Rondón, the archetypal workmanlike striker, does not share Asprilla’s penchant for the magical but his bustling aggression could prove invaluable in what could be a long season for Benítez’s side. It will be interesting to see how he is complemented by Kenedy, unavailable against his parent club and who despite his ordeal against Cardiff is one of the few match‑winners at Benítez’s disposal. A potent partnership may await – though the fact that Newcastle’s attacking hopes lie with two loanees is a grim sign of the times as the Mike Ashley era lumbers on. Alex HessThings were supposed to be different but a return of one point from a possible nine feels eerily reminiscent of Southampton’s struggles last season. Despite strengthening the squad this summer, Saints still appear a little fragile in both boxes Danny Ings has added a spark but Shane Long has scored just once since January. Mark Hughes is yet to establish a winning formula nor his strongest XI, with a number of players, such as Jack Stephens, James Ward-Prowse and the club captain, Steven Davis, pushed towards the periphery. Some have already headed for the door, while Harrison Reed and Sam Gallagher could yet depart. Tuesday’s trip to Brighton in the Carabao Cup presents a chance for fringe players to seize their chance. “It’s up to those guys out of the team to push and get back in,” Hughes said. “We need to freshen it up.” Ben Fisher Christian Benteke offered a puff of the cheeks when his number went up five minutes from the end to conclude another fruitless afternoon’s work. The Belgian had impressed in flashes, offering some of that power that used to be his trademark. But yet again he left with nothing to show for his efforts. Ben Foster had thwarted his header and a smart turn-and-shot fizzed wide of an upright as Palace chased parity against early-season pace-setters. The 27-year-old’s return now stands at three goals in 35 Premier League matches and clinging to the familiar hope – that a fluke flying in off his backside prompts an avalanche – is starting to feel tiresome. His confidence is brittle and how he fares against Southampton next weekend may be key to his season. This team need to be more ruthless. Benteke has been wanting on that front for a while. Dominic FifieldAugust feels a bit too soon to talk about a potential save of the season but Rui Patrício filed an early contender with a superb piece of goalkeeping when he spectacularly tipped Raheem Sterling’s terrific half-volley on to the bar. Patrício, who has won 73 caps for Portugal and helped them to win Euro 2016, terminated his deal with Sporting Lisbon in the summer and moved to Wolves on a free transfer. Sporting were furious. They say Patrício broke his contract and have demanded £50m in compensation for the 30-year-old, which seems about the going rate for top international goalkeepers these days. Whatever the outcome of that dispute, there was much to admire about the brilliant one-handed save that prevented City from taking the lead on Saturday. Well, unless you are Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves manager. “Rui did well,” the former goalkeeper said. “That’s his job.” Stuart James "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

They have all been rejected multiple times – and, what’s more, they’re proud of it.Vardalos revealed that she was dumped by her agent for “not being pretty” and told by her manager “actors can’t be writers”. A year later, she starred in her first screenplay, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Blackman said she received 82 rejection letters before she was published. Later, she was told that her novel Noughts \u0026amp Crosses had been rejected for a literary award because “it would have shown more insight if a white author had written it”.Harris was sent rejection letters for what would become her bestselling novel Chocolat that described her manuscript as “too parochial” and “too European”, advising her to set it in the US and “dump the food”. Wright revealed: “I was passed over for a TV commercial to be done in the style of Spaced, even though I was the actual director of Spaced.”Usually, the connection between rejection and success is kept private. But a public outpouring recently on social media – not only by celebrities but by others using the #ShareYourRejections hashtag – questions why this is so. What is there to fear from rejection? And why do some people seem to cope with it better than others?Jia Jiang spent 100 days seeking out rejection and then wrote a book about his experiences, Rejection Proof: How to Beat Fear and Become Invincible. “I realised my fear of being rejected was worse than the rejection itself. I started losing my fear and having fun instead,” he said.He thinks everyone should practise getting rejected for unimportant things that don’t hurt too much. “It’s a skill to be able to handle rejection in a way that helps turn a ‘no’ into a ‘yes’. Practising being rejected when the stakes are low sets you up for success when it’s more serious. Persistence and tenacity can get you far. If you want to be successful and make an impact while you are on earth, you’re going to have to face rejection. If you run away from it the whole time, you’re going to have\u0026nbspregrets.”Clinical psychologist Dr Jessamy Hibberd says that the way you interpret rejection is important. “Most things worth doing take time and patience. Instead of telling yourself a rejection means ‘I’m not good at this’, you could interpret it as: ‘I’m not there yet’ or ‘this is just one person’s view’. Times when you’ve been rejected and felt disappointed but coped with it fine can be helpful to hold on to, because it makes you fear rejection less in the future and go for things more. You feel like you’ve got less to risk.”The young adult author Shannon Hale, who busts all the gender stereotypes about princesses with her latest illustrated series The Princess in Black, received a letter every week for two years rejecting her multiple award-winning first novel, The Goose Girl. “If you’re a man and you write about boys, you have a much better chance of getting published, because those books are marketed at everyone, while women who write books about girls are often marketed solely at girls.”Similarly, books by white authors about white families are perceived to have a universal appeal by publishers, while books by writers of colour featuring BAME characters are seen as niche, she says, resulting in smaller publishing quotas for more erse writers. “We want to believe it’s a meritocracy but everyone has unconscious biases. Not everyone’s going to love what you do, and that’s not necessarily anything to do with how talented you are.”When visiting schools, she talks to children about coping with rejection. Under #ShareYourRejections, she posted a photo of herself in a school assembly hall, laying down all her rejection letters in a long, laminated line. “There were times I wanted to give up but I had people in my life who believed in me – their support was crucial – and I felt writing was the only career that would make me happy.” Rejection was good for her, she thinks. “It can be motivating. It’s such a good feeling when you prove them wrong. I feel like I can weather just about everything now.”Nadia Latif, 34, associate director of the Young Vic, is equally positive about the fact that she was rejected from hundreds of directing jobs and bursaries in her 20s. “Being rejected has made me incredibly clear and uncompromising about who I am and my creative practice. It’s given me a sense of defiance. I want to make work that sticks it to power.”Every time she received a rejection, she would fire off three emails pursuing a new connection or opportunity. “I didn’t take it too personally. Everyone knows that being part of a creative industry means dealing with rejection, and I wasn’t going to let it get to me. I’ve wanted to be a director since I was at school. I’m the eldest of six so I was the family trailblazer – and I have dogged self-belief.”As a black Muslim woman, she often found it difficult to put her finger on why she was rejected, however. “Any oppressed group brings an extra level of baggage into the process. already got an anxiety about being ‘other’ before you get rejected.” Systemic racism, she points out, can be really subtle. “There are very few black female theatre directors with visible careers. If more erse people were doing the interviews, maybe you’d get more ersity getting through.”Jiang agrees that minorities get rejected more than majorities, and thinks that being white and male enables an advantageous mindset. “If you’re in the majority, no part of you thinks you were rejected because of your race or sex. It may be easier to think creatively about how to improve and overcome each rejection, instead of feeling rejection is inevitable and insurmountable.”When Jeff Ollerton, professor of bioersity at the University of Northampton, had a paper rejected by a journal for being “not very interesting”, he was one of the many #ShareYourRejections Twitter users who refused to take no for an answer. “I got quite cross,” he says. “I knew from my own experience there would be interest in it and that we all make bad judgments. I wrote to the editor that the reviewers were wrong and the rejection was shabby.” The journal eventually backed down and published the paper, which has since been cited more than 1,110 times.On social media, University of Glasgow professor Jo Sharp revealed that she had a paper rejected once because she “didn’t seem to know the work of Jo Sharp well enough”. “I found it quite funny. I was relieved I clearly wasn’t too dependent on self-citation.”Some rejections can be especially personal. Patrick Gilmore, a brand strategist, tweeted that, when he first asked out his wife five years ago, she told him she only wanted to be friends. He had received a rejection letter that day for a book he was writing. “I thought: I’m not being turned down twice in one day. I’ve often been described as a stubborn bastard. I knew I really liked her and I figured I had nothing to lose except my pride.” He agreed to meet up “as friends” and was optimistic the date would go well – which it did. The couple now have a two-year-old son and another baby on the way. “I sometimes think about what my life would be like if I had just accepted my wife’s rejection. I feel very lucky.”• Remember that no rejection is final, says Jiang – nor should it be the end of a conversation. “Always ask why you’ve been rejected and then ask for something else: explain why what you’re offering is valuable, tell them why you really want to do this, and ask them who can help\u0026nbspyou.”• Give yourself time to succeed, says Hibberd. “Don’t expect to get it right first time. More often than not, you’re going to take a few wrong turns before you work out the right turn.”• Consider the way you talk to yourself about rejection. Knowing why you failed is not useless information, Hibberd argues. “The more you keep going, the more helpful information you’ll get about how to succeed. Find a way to think: ‘Right, I’m going to show them.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0082deec05d5044877a3c6c056df7670a04d4/0_0_1960_1180/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1d5c18036e12c668799fa9229ccbaf","title":"greece in 10 audiobooks a listeners literary guide","story":"Myths, magic and mandolins feature in these stories about one of Europe’s oldest and grandest culturesIf you’re planning a summer vacation to Greece, the good news is it’s hard to get it wrong. From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Beveridge added that hefty stamp duty charges were also pushing second-movers out of the capital. “More people are making a bigger move and buying a larger home sooner to avoid having to pay stamp duty on additional moves as they trade up. For many, this means heading further north.”The average stamp duty bill for buying a detached home in the south is £14,780, compared with £5,358 in the north, Hamptons said.Most Londoners selling up move to the home counties, but the proportion going further afield has risen markedly in recent years. In 2008 one in 17 headed to the north or Midlands, but now the figure is one in five.Hamptons said the typical London leaver buying in the south-west of England paid nearly £550,000 for a home. It said moves to the south-west were not just about retirement, with evidence that many people are commuting long-distance back to the capital, often staying in London for a few days a week.In some towns, such as Hastings, the surge in Londoners  is blamed for pushing up prices to levels that local residents cannot afford and creating gentrified enclaves.However, that was a slight improvement on last year, with the help-to-buy scheme assisting some purchasers. “But even though more Londoners are buying their first home in the capital than last year, more are being priced out of the south altogether,” Hamptons said.Richard Donnell of Hometrack, said: “The fact house prices in some of our biggest cities are still recovering from the financial crisis shows how big an impact it had on the UK’s regional housing markets.“While 2008 was the year when house prices fell at their fastest rate, they continued to fall for a further three to four years in the weaker performing markets as the impact of the recession and restricted credit availability hit the value of people’s homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd11ce17038f9954cf7ba3abd726bdcf48bd7521/0_117_3507_2104/master/3507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d386eae0803948c1bb1cbf23e1b2436","title":"ace of cups interview record first album","story":"They opened for Jimi Hendrix and were friends with the Grateful Dead but never got the opportunity to release their own music until nowIf you were around in their heyday, the Ace of Cups are already legends. They’re the band that opened for Jimi Hendrix in Golden Gate Park in the summer of 1967, just days after Hendrix burned his name into history at the Monterey Pop Festival. They’re the band that opened for the Band during the latter group’s three-night run at Winterland Ballroom in 1968. They’re the band that was friends with and peers of Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and other icons of the mythically heady and musically prolific 1960s San Francisco scene.But the Ace of Cups didn’t become icons themselves. Having never recorded an album, the group left little more than a collection of bootleg recordings and a stack of concert posters on which their name is printed alongside some of the era’s most revered acts. But with the impending release of their debut studio LP, the Ace of Cups – an all-female outfit composed of women now in their 70s – is course-correcting rock history.It was New Year’s Eve 1966 when Kaufman met Mary Ellen Simpson at a party in the Haight-Ashbury district. Simpson was in a bedroom playing blues guitar. Kaufman – 19 years old and fresh off Ken Kesey’s bus (Tom Wolfe changed her name to “Mary Microgram” in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test) – grabbed a harmonica. The two jammed as 66 became 67, and Simpson invited Kaufman to come play with some friends. Days later, in the living room of a big house in the Haight, the two women, along with bassist Mary Gannon, keyboardist Marla Hunt and drummer Diane Vitalich, gathered for a jam session.“I had never heard of an all-women’s band,” Kaufman says, “and it had never occurred to me that there were all-women’s bands. It was such an unthinkable idea.”And yet there they were, naturally falling into five-part harmonies, sharing lead vocals and playing music that was raucous, rebellious, funny and loud. They wrote their first song that night and then named themselves after a tarot card. The scene’s first and only all-female act was born.In 1967, the San Francisco scene was coming into full Technicolor bloom. It was the Summer of Love, and in the Park, anti-capitalist group the Diggers were providing free meals to hippies flooding into the city from around the US. The Grateful Dead lived at 710 Ashbury Street in a communal house paid for by famed LSD chemist Owsley Stanley. The Haight’s Psychedelic Shop had been raided by police the previous year for selling The Love Book, a collection by beat poet Lenore Kandel that included the censored poem To Fuck with Love. The constricting social rules of the 50s and early 60s were deteriorating, and psychedelic rock – louder, looser and grittier than the safe, sweet popular music of the day – was the soundtrack to their disintegration. Everyone there knew the moment was special.“There was an energy in the air,” Kaufman says, “and a sense of connection.”At the time, Kaufman was employed at the San Francisco label Fantasy Records (John Fogerty, then playing with the Golliwogs, worked in the record packing room), and one of the label owners helped the Ace of Cups get some equipment. Ambrose Hollingworth, who ran Quicksilver Messenger Service, began managing them, and the women quit their day jobs and moved to a house in Marin county to practice full-time. Their buzz grew with gigs around the Bay, up north at Mount Shasta and at the Festival of Growing Things (“free seeds”, read the poster for the two-day event) where they played barefoot on Mount Tamalpais as part of a lineup also featuring Big Brother and the Holding Company, Steve Miller Band and Country Joe \u0026amp the Fish.Soon they were playing in the Park with Hendrix, who borrowed their equipment for a set he and the Experience played from the back of a flatbed truck. (In December of 1967, Hendrix told Melody Maker: “I heard some groovy sounds last time in the States, like this girl group, Ace Of Cups, who write their own songs and the lead guitarist is hell, really great.”) Like many bands in the scene, they played countless benefit shows for everything from civil rights to national post office day. Kaufman recalls the group playing particularly well during their run with the Band and making a trip to Chicago to play a festival with blues legends including James Cotton, Sam Lay and Muddy Waters. Their messages of equal rights, decommodification and female empowerment were in line with the major social issues of the era.But a record deal never materialized, a circumstance Kaufman believes was due to the fact that label execs didn’t know how to market a rock band made up of five female lead singers in top hats and paisley.“We were hippie girls,” she says. “I don’t know what that looked like to these guys that came in their suits from Los Angeles and New York.”The women were also having babies, and with families to care for there was greater concern that the Ace of Cups as a commercial enterprise was never going to take off. “In order to play and tour, you have to be able to have childcare, and we just couldn’t figure out how to handle it all,” Kaufman says. While men in the scene were starting families and still touring freely, the women didn’t have this luxury and, by 1972, the Ace of Cups had splintered.Simpson moved to northern California, ultimately becoming a mental health caseworker. Vitalich stayed in Marin and became a practitioner of shiatsu massage. Gannon went back to school to become a music teacher, and Kaufman first moved to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and then to Los Angeles, where she went to music school and taught Bikram yoga to clients including Madonna, Quincy Jones, Jane Fonda and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.While music was still a constant in all their lives, the Ace of Cups might have remained a footnote to rock history without George Wallace, the founder of the New York-based label High Moon Records. Always obsessed with the San Francisco scene, Wallace heard It’s Bad For You But Buy It, a compilation of Ace of Cups bootlegs released by Big Beat Records in 2003.While he was launching his label, Wallace planned a trip out west to look for musical buried treasure that High Moon might rerelease. He had written down Denise’s name as someone who might point him in the right direction. At the time, the Ace of Cups were getting together to play the 75th birthday of counterculture figure Wavy Gravy, and when Wallace saw them rock this event, he knew he had struck gold.“The discussion shifted to, ‘Wait a minute, you guys are starting to play and rehearse, why don’t we make the album that should have been made 50 years ago?’’ Wallace says.The women, minus Hunt, gathered at Laughing Tiger Studio in Marin to finally record their debut. “There’s a record being made,” Kaufman announces at the beginning of the eponymous album, which is out on 9 November and features special guests including the folk legend Buffy Sainte-Marie, blues hero Taj Mahal, the Grateful Dead’s Bob Weir and other artists the Cups have known since the 60s.“We wanted this album to be a gathering of community,” Kaufman says, “and it really feels like that.”The album was produced by Dan Shea, who’s worked with superstars such as Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Celine Dion and Janet Jackson, and who was instrumental in helping the Ace of Cups hone their prowess in the studio. The group winnowed down 100 original songs to the 26 on the album, with a second LP due next spring. For Kaufman, Gannon, Simpson and Vitalich, the recording process was a psychedelic dream come true.“Each of them has come up to me separately during the making of this album,” Wallace says, “and told me that recording it has been the peak experience of their life.”For Kaufman, the timing feels like kismet, with the group’s anti-war and higher consciousness themes as relevant today as they were when the Ace of Cups were playing for tripping hippies in the park. While there’s not yet a concrete tour schedule, she envisions performances followed by group discussions about pressing social issues. Wallace envisions the Ace of Cups finally taking their rightful place on lists of history’s most influential female acts and classic rock bands. To see four gray-haired women, a sort of Ya-Ya Sisterhood of the Haight, rocking together certainly feels like an extension of the female empowerment ideals that guided their work.“Women our age are kind of invisible in the public sphere and in a lot of ways are told to retire and go crawl under a rock,” Kaufman says, “so it’s interesting to be out in public and getting this opportunity we didn’t get 50 years ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3336104a5c465b81926901bb3ac461914b5ecf7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23099e406f4e44a4978b418ebc3c438a","title":"essential pop jazz folk music of autumn 2018","story":"Young talents and old hands hit the road, intriguing festivals mix things up, and there’s the first posthumous release from Princeby  Alexis Petridis,  Robin Denselow,  John Fordham and  Imogen TildenArctic Monkeys’ sixth studio album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, proved to be the most controversial and slowest-selling of their career, which perhaps tells you rather more about their fans than it does about the radical nature of the album’s Serge Gainsbourg and Beach Boys-inspired contents. It will be interesting to see how said contents work played live in arenas. Tour begins 6 September, Manchester ArenaAn appropriately titled comeback album from Nile Rodgers, who’s been touring around the world with a latterday version of Chic for over a decade, and constantly promising a new album during that time. So 26 years after the last Chic album, and wrapped in a sleeve that explicitly references their eponymous 1977 debut, here it is: apparently boasting a Daft Punk influence and guest appearances by everyone from Janelle Monáe and Anderson.Paak to Elton John. Released 7 SeptemberBetter known as a blue-chip pop architect – songwriting and producing for Beyoncé, Madonna, Stomzy and Dua Lipa amonst others – MNEK has been quietly releasing his own material for four years, without really matching the impact of his backroom work, his hit 2016 duet with Zara Larsson, Never Forget You, notwithstanding. Whether Language will change that remains to be seen: the singles released to date suggest a slick pop-soul hybrid. Released 7 SeptemberCurrently on a farewell tour, Simon’s new album finds him reworking “songs that I thought were almost right, or were odd enough to be overlooked the first time around” in the company of jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and the National’s Bryce Dessner. None of the big hits are there, although you certainly get a sense which of his albums Simon thinks is most unfairly overlooked: almost half the tracklisting is taken from 2000’s You’re the One. Released 7 SeptemberWith only a small nation’s jazz talent to recruit from, and zilch sponsorship in its infancy, the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra led by gifted saxophonist Tommy Smith nonetheless evolved into a world-class outfit. They have partnered international stars, produced scintillating original music, and reimagined classic works through visionary arranging and improvisation. The band’s autumn series opens on reworkings of timeless themes by Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, John Scofield and many more. At venues in Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh, 7 September -6 DecemberHer 14th album saw a distinct change of musical tack: you couldn’t miss the country influence on Golden, an album recorded in Nashville that gamely attempted to meld fiddles and banjos with influences from house and EDM, while the lyrics seemed noticeably more personal and emotionally wracked than previously. Whether this is a direction she’ll pursue in future is an interesting question, doubtless these shows will offer extravagantly glittery business as usual. Tour begins 18 September, Newcastle  Radio ArenaThe follow-up to the UK’s biggest-selling debut album of 2016, heralded by what may be 2018’s best pop single, the fantastic Girlfriend, and an extraordinary choreographed live performance of the track on Later. Chris is apparently “sweatier, harder, more erotic” than Chaleur Humaine, with Janet and Michael Jackson, Eminem, and Serge Gainsbourg in 80s funk mode in its DNA. Released 21 SeptemberThe first posthumous release to draw upon Prince’s legendary vault of unreleased material is oddly low-key, perhaps chosen because it fits the concept of the stripped-back tour the singer was on when he died: a home recording from between the release of 1999 and the global success of Purple Rain, that features an early version of Sign O’ the Times’ Strange Relationship and covers of both the gospel spiritual Mary Don’t You Weep and Joni Mitchell’s A Case of You. Released 21 SeptemberThe young Somerset singer-songwriter has been a semi-finalist in the BBC Young Folk awards and has supported Kathryn Roberts \u0026amp Sean Lakeman on tour. Her remarkably accomplished debut album, Namer of Clouds, beguiles with its poetry and tenderness, and her eye for detail, vivid imagination and bright vocals make it a captivating listen. She is a talent to watch. Album released 21 September (Navigator Records). On tour 1 September-9 DecemberA solitary – and apparently final – reunion gig from the trickiest and most transgressive of 80s synth pop stars. It was hard to avoid the feeling that Marc Almond and David Ball didn’t quite realise the esteem and affection in which their oeuvre was held until the success of Almond’s 10CD, career-ning 2016 box set Trials of Eyeliner. Whatever the reasons, this show is a guaranteed treat for fans of their brief but frequently extraordinary back catalogue. 30 September, O2 Arena, LondonCanadian electronic auteur and sound artist Hecker makes reliably fascinating albums that exist in a space between punishing noise, becalmed ambience and modern classical music. His latest represents a vast shift away from the sound of its predecessor Love Streams, into music inspired by gagaku, a form of Japanese classical music performed at the imperial court – sections of it were recorded in a temple on the outskirts of Tokyo. It sounds as simultaneously challenging and thrilling as usual. Released 28 SeptemberThe annual K-Music festival is an intriguing reminder of South Korea’s experimental folk-rock, jazz and fusion scene. Highlights this year include glam-folk-rock band Ssing Ssing, and E-Do, who mix traditional and rock influences, and are led by the remarkable Professor Yu Kyung-hwa, who plays the chulhyungeum, a cross between a Korean zither and guitar. At venues across London, 2 October-20 NovemberThe six years that separate Wanderer from Cat Power’s last album Sun have apparently been trying for singer-songwriter Chan Marshall: bankruptcy, ill health – she was disgnosed with an hereditary immune disorder that causes the face to swell up – and the collapse of a relationship. Wanderer comes out swinging: a guest appearance by Lana Del Rey, a cover of Rihanna’s Stay, a stripped-back sound and a succession of fantastic songs. Released 5 OctoberAnd so the series of lavishly packaged Bowie box sets reaches his most commercially successful and controversial decade: there are remixes and unreleased live albums on offer, but most interest will presumably be piqued by a complete reworking of 1987’s infamously disastrous Never Let Me Down, with new parts recorded by various Bowie sidemen after the singer’s death. Can it make his artistic nadir sparkle? We shall see. Released 12 OctoberIdles’ brand of twitchy, visceral guitar noise and dark street-poetry lyrics feels very much like a product of now. They released their debut single in 2012, but there’s something striking about the way they’ve gained such momentum in angry, ided, post-Brexit referendum Britain. The acclaim’s fully deserved: their songs are smart, potent and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny – Never Fight a Man With a Perm counsels the title of a track from their second album – and live they’re chaotically thrilling. Tour begins 16 October, SWX, BristolBy all accounts, U2’s current tour represents a very different beast from their acclaimed 2017 outing performing The Joshua Tree in its entirety, its setlist dodging some of their biggest hits – no Where the Streets Have No Name or New Year’s Day. Its opening involves the audience watching the show through an app on their phones for an “augmented reality” experience, and also features Bono’s Zoo TV-era alter-ego MacPhisto. UK tour begins 19 October, Manchester ArenaAfter triumphant London shows to promote her second album, Fenfo, the husky-voiced Malian singer-songwriter heads out on tour to demonstrate why she rates alongside her compatriots Oumou Sangaré and Rokia Traoré as one of the most inventive and dynamic performers in Africa. At her best, she mixes delicate solo work with high energy songs, dance routines, social comment and African-edged reworkings of classics such as Stevie Wonder’s Higher Ground. Touring 19-24 NovemberA well-curated two-day festival – fairly obviously hosted indoors given that it’s the middle of October – All Years Leaving neatly gathers together a bunch of 2018’s most acclaimed guitar bands: from the seething power of Goat Girl to the Orielles’ idiosyncratic off-kilter garage rock, by way of the sleazily ecelectic Fat White Family offshoot Warmduscher and punky power-pop trio Dream Wife. 20-21 October, Hare \u0026amp Hounds, BirminghamArguably the most acclaimed live shows of the year, the blend of brilliantly simplistic staging and lighting, hugely impressive choreography – everyone on stage is in constant motion – and Byrne’s fantastic backing band makes for a genuinely boundary-breaking experience. The setlist is fantastic – heavy on selections from Talking Heads’ avant Afro-funk albums – and the whole gig is quite unlike anything else that’s been attempted in the area of live rock music. UK tour begins 21 October, First Direct Arena, LeedsThe fourth solo album by the former Czars frontman, now resident in Iceland, arrives three years after its predecessor, Grey Tickles, Black Pressure. Co-produced by Benge – one third of Wrangler, the electronic band with whom Grant formed the side project Creep Show – and featuring arrangements by Midlake bassist Paul Alexander, the lead single and title track suggests that lyrically, there’s no let-up in Grant’s brutally frank confessional approach. Released 21 OctoberMusgraves arrives in the UK for a series of live dates on the back of her fourth major label album, Golden Hour, not just a career best but one of the albums of the year so far: a beautifully-turned example of classic Nashville songwriting stretching out into everything from Daft Punk-ish disco-house to hazy psychedelia, with lyrics that touch on everything from LGBTQ rights to LSD. UK tour begins 23 October, Bristol HippodromeThe English fiddler is more usually to be found bringing his sprightly virtuosity and sweet tones to groups such as Leveret, Eliza Carthy’s Wayward Band and Bellowhead. His first solo release is inspired by the extraordinary tale of his own violin – carved but left unfinished by a music hall performer who was killed on the battlefields of the first world war. Sweeney has collected music that would have been heard or made in the British trenches, as well as tunes from Belgium, France, and Germany in this beautiful collection of instrumentals that makes for a poignant and thoughtful memorial to the war in this centenary year. Album released 2 November (Island Records)A solitary UK date for Donald Glover in hip-hop mode, following the vast success of This Is America, not merely a US No 1 single but by some distance the most discussed music video in recent memory. His headlining set at this summer’s Lovebox festival – Glover’s first live performance in the UK for five years – was wildly acclaimed: given his plan to retire the Childish Gambino name after his next album, there’s a certain unmissable urgency about this show. 4 November, O2 Arena, LondonHas there been a more inescapable song this summer than George Ezra’s Shotgun? It’s proved 2018’s equivalent of Avicii’s Wake Me Up or Ed Sheeran’s Castle on the Hill: a single that seems almost impossible to avoid whether you want to or not, testament to the ability of Ezra’s unassuming if curiously enunciated folk-pop to unite teen audiences and Radio Two listeners alike in appreciation. It seems unlikely he’ll be playing venues this size much longer. Tour begins 8 November, O2 Academy, NewcastleBarnett’s last UK dates involved her playing her second album Tell Me How You Really Feel in full, a pretty bold, even confrontational move, given that it had only been released a few weeks before. She could doubtless do it again at these shows to a much more excited response: packed with smart, sensitive observations, noticeably noisier and angrier than her debut, it’s one of 2018’s understated delights. UK tour begins 14 November, O2 Brixton Academy, LondonThe 10-day EFG London Jazz Festival – the biggest deal in the UK’s jazz calendar and pretty big in broader contemporary and world-music terms, too, returns for its 26th year. Highlights include the veteran South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim and vocal star Madeleine Peyroux, accessible experimenters such as trumpeter Dave Douglas and guitarists Bill Frisell and Mary Halvorson, actor Jeff Goldblum in jazz-piano guise, and rising young UK stars such as saxophonists Camilla George and Nubya Garcia. Various venues across London, 16-25 NovemberA tour designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of her classic album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill – the anniversary arrives in the same year that Drake sampled Ex-Factor on the chart-topping Nice For What – but who knows how it will pan out? In the years since its release, Hill has become a byword for erratic live performances the reviews of her recent US shows were wildly mixed and some gigs were cancelled. Fingers crossed. Tour begins 23 November, SSE Hydro, GlasgowThe album launch show for Years \u0026amp Years’ Palo Santo felt like a spirited attempt to cram a stadium-sized show into the confines of London’s Roundhouse, replete with costume changes and special effects. It all bodes well for their forthcoming arena tour: as does the fact that Palo Santo represented a clear musical progression from their debut, confirming Years \u0026amp Years as one of the UK’s deeper and more intriguing pop bands. UK tour begins 28 November, SSE Hydro, GlasgowThe long-awaited follow-up to Popcaan’s raucous 2014 debut album Where We Come From finally appeared this summer: trailed by the great single Body So Good, Forever met with mixed reviews – some observers thought that his desire to cross over to a pop market undermined its sound. That said, the Jamaican deejay’s ascendancy to dancehall’s top flight is underlined by the fact that the London date of his UK tour sees him playing Wembley Arena. Tour begins 6 December, SSE Arena, Wembley, LondonArriving in the wake of his Greg Kurstin and Ryan Tedder-produced album Egypt Station, it will be intriguing to see if and how much McCartney changes up his live show: his appearance at last year’s Desert Trip festival attracted some criticism for the fact the set seemed almost identical to that at every gig he’s played for years, song introductions and all. Still, you would have a hard time arguing with the actual quality of the songs he plays.

It would be perfectly possible to continue with historic arrangements to ensure that there wasn’t a great loophole in the way people can get into the UK, to leave us in as bad a position as we are already in,” Rees-Mogg says.“There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day, but of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border, to try and stop gun-running and things like that.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was sharply critical of his comments. “This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland,” he said.Rees-Mogg has previously been criticised for saying he did not need to visit Northern Ireland to understand the challenges Brexit posed for communities on the border.His comments, earlier this year, were described as arrogant and judgmental by people living there. In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland, he said: “I don’t think my visiting the border is really going give me a fundamental insight into the border beyond what one can get by studying it.”The Sinn Féin politician Mártín Ó Muilleoir, South Belfast MLA, said Rees-Mogg’s comments on the border after Brexit showed “contempt and complete disregard for the people of Ireland north and south, through the ridiculous suggestion of a ‘technological border’.“Anyone labouring under the misapprehension that the Tories care a jot about the north is living in a fool’s paradise.”The status of the Irish border remains one of the toughest sticking points in the UK’s negotiations on a withdrawal agreement with the EU.Theresa May has said no UK prime minister could accept the EU’s proposal, for Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the customs union and the single market, with the rest of the UK outside – requiring a border in the Irish Sea.The EU for its part regards Britain’s solution of a “facilitated customs arrangement”as unworkable.The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, acknowledged on Friday that the October deadline once regarded as the end-date for the Brexit negotiations could now slip to November.Tensions among senior Conservatives in cabinet were also exposed at the weekend, as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, played down the significance of Treasury forecasts suggesting a no-deal Brexit would blow an £80bn hole in public finances.“I’m always wary of any forecast, because most of them have been proved to be wrong,” he told the Sunday Times.As May battles to complete a deal, Rees-Mogg is leading a vocal group of Conservative MPs calling on the party to “chuck Chequers”, the negotiating position painstakingly agreed by cabinet at their July awayday.They are keen to play down the significance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which they believe has driven the logic of the push toward a softer Brexit.Boris Johnson told MPs in his resignation speech, after he rejected the Chequers deal: “We allowed the question of the Northern Irish border, which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa2db7efb9645b770dde26c1cff05ce07e65c54a/0_17_4712_2829/master/4712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0167680df87b59dc00306a0c991c935e","title":"nicola sturgeon says snp is not able to suspend alex salmond","story":"Scottish first minister says party has not received a complaint for it to act uponNicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party is not legally able to suspend Alex Salmond over allegations of sexual harassment after facing calls from other parties to take action.The first minister and SNP leader said the complaints were being investigated by the Scottish government, which was unable to share details of the complaint or the names of Salmond’s two accusers to third-party organisations.Salmond, a former SNP leader and first minister, has repeatedly denied he is guilty of harassment or criminality, but opposition parties insist that since the claims have been passed to the police, the party should suspend his membership.The Daily Record, which first broke the story, has alleged that, in one of the incidents under investigation, Salmond touched the breasts and bottom of a female civil servant at Bute House, his then official residence in Edinburgh, in December 2013.Two women lodged complaints against Salmond in January 2018 using new anti-harassment procedures introduced for the Scottish government by Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s chief civil servant, in the wake of harassment scandals at Westminster.In a statement issued on Sunday, Sturgeon said: “In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.“Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party – and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.”Sturgeon added: “In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond’s membership. Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member. The party’s rules apply to all members and no one is above them.”Salmond has already retaliated against the Scottish government by lodging a judicial review of its handling of the complaints against him, accusing them of breaching his confidentiality by leaking details of the investigation – a charge the Scottish government denies.He welcomed Sturgeon’s statement on Twitter, saying: “I agree with Nicola that every single person in Scotland, regardless of who they are, should be treated fairly and equally. That included being given confidentiality and treated with fairness.“Clearly it has not been maintained in this case but subject to sustained leaking of the most unfair kind. That helps no-one but harms everyone. It is therefore crucial to find out who in government was responsible.”Rhoda Grant, for Scottish Labour, demanded that the Scottish government reveal all details of meetings between Salmond and Sturgeon where the complaints were discussed. Salmond said he had met her face to face three times, and implied they had had other contacts too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa50f0e1d82295315880fe4b7bbf152ab551f0ed/0_529_4386_2631/master/4386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c3847a570e3bb372870fb5e0b71ef0","title":"no deal brexit uk legal vacuum keir starmer theresa may","story":"Exclusive: shadow Brexit secretary says Theresa May would face race to pass lawsTheresa May and the government would face a race against time to pass a slew of new laws, or risk creating an “unsustainable legal vacuum”, if Britain plunged out of the EU without a deal, Labour’s Keir Starmer has warned.Dominic Raab insisted last week that the government had the legislation in place to cope, if Britain is forced to leave in March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement.“Our laws will be on the statute book, the staff will be in place, the teams will be in post and our institutions will be ready for Brexit – deal, or no deal,” the Brexit secretary said.But Labour’s analysis suggests new legislation would have to be passed hastily in four key policy areas:The government has long promised an immigration bill – but has not yet even published a white paper.Several new regulators or other public bodies would also have to be created, including in medicines and aviation, Labour claims. The withdrawal bill gives ministers some powers to do this, but they are tightly curtailed.Starmer described last week’s release of 24 technical notices on how the government is preparing for a no deal as a “poorly executed PR stunt designed to convince Tory MPs to back the prime minister’s discredited Chequers proposal”.He said the government has “barely scratched the surface” of what would need to be done to prepare the UK for a no-deal scenario, and there was a serious risk of an “unsustainable legal vacuum”.The withdrawal agreement with the EU is intended to allow for most existing laws and institutions to remain in place during a transitional period of almost two years, while the government negotiates the details of its future trading relationship with the EU.But if talks break down – or MPs reject the deal – it is unclear what would happen next. Given the March deadline created by triggering article 50, one possibility is that Britain could end up leaving without any agreement in place.Joe Owen, of thinktank the Institute for Government, said that in theory parliament could pass legislation rapidly in an emergency but it is unclear whether MPs would cooperate. “Parliament could hold it up, if it wanted to,” he said. “Whichever avenue you go down, there’s going to be a bunfight in parliament.”Hardline Brexiters on the Conservative backbenches are keen to play down the risks of a no-deal outcome, with some believing it would be preferable to the Chequers position, with its “common rulebook” and single market for goods.They reacted angrily to chancellor Philip Hammond’s decision to release a letter last week highlighting Treasury forecasts that the hit to GDP under a no-deal scenario could be £80bn.Former Brexit secretary David Davis used an article in the Sun on Sunday to urge the public to “ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it”.With another week to go before MPs return to Westminster from their long summer recess, campaign groups on both sides of the Brexit ide are gearing up to try to influence the outcome of what promises to be a tense six months.People’s Vote, a cross-party pressure group that hopes to secure a referendum on the final Brexit deal, is urging its members not to attack the Labour leadership, as they seek to secure a vote at the party’s conference on the issue.In a leaked memo seen by the , its director of communications, Tom Baldwin, says: “This campaign is not about Jeremy Corbyn and we must not – will not – use it to damage or undermine the party’s leadership or attack them personally.”Baldwin also seeks to shut down recent rumours that the People’s Vote campaign could be used as a vehicle for a breakaway group of Labour MPs to form a new political party.A hard Brexit would take Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big EU budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ: what Brexiters mean by “taking back control” of Britain’s borders, laws and money. It would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) FTA was agreed.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The looming prospect of a botched Brexit is too important for anyone to use it for the pursuit of any other political objective,” he says.Labour has edged closer to backing a referendum on the final deal, if parliament rejects it – though the leadership would prefer the opportunity to challenge May in a general election.“The EU Withdrawal Act is a crucial piece of legislation that will ensure there is a functioning statute book on exit day, irrespective of the outcome of negotiations.”Meanwhile Leave Means Leave, which counts Nigel Farage among its prominent backers, has set itself a £5m fundraising target in a bid to persuade May and her cabinet to ditch the Chequers position and press ahead with a “clean Brexit”.“Leave Means Leave have the fight of our lives ahead of us. We are the David to the establishment’s Goliath but we are committed to winning this fight,” said its chair, John Longworth.The government’s technical notices on a no-deal Brexit – the first batch of more than 80 expected to be released before the end of next month – warned that tariffs could be imposed on UK exports, credit card payments to the EU would become more expensive and Brits living abroad could lose access to payments from their bank accounts.However, ramping up preparations for a no-deal outcome was one aspect of the agreement reached in Chequers in July. May has scheduled an extra cabinet meeting, on 13 September, to discuss the government’s readiness, with some ministers complaining not enough is being done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa79b9567452dc74bd8ab4ed201851bc41133c6/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83821c47cb579b2c805386c8546d23d0","title":"vince cable radical reforms lib dems","story":"Allies deny reports party leader will trigger leadership contest next monthVince Cable has told his MPs he will not remain Liberal Democrat leader in the long term, but hopes to push through radical reform of his party’s rulebook before stepping aside.Cable is due to make a speech on 7 September, a week before party members gather for their annual conference in Brighton.He is expected to outline proposals for sweeping changes to his party’s rules, including introducing a new category of registered supporter, similar to the hundreds of thousands who signed up to back Jeremy Corbyn in Labour’s 2015 leadership contest.Another rule change under consideration is to allow non-MPs to stand for the party’s leadership – a measure that would spark speculation about whether Cable wants to make the Lib Dems a vehicle for realignment of the centre ground in British politics.Allies denied reports that Cable would use the occasion to trigger a leadership contest in the near term, saying that he would not announce a date. They did acknowledge, however, that while Cable would continue as party leader for an early general election – if Theresa May is forced to call one next year, for example – he would be unlikely to stay on until 2022, when the next general election is due if parliament runs its course.Other Lib Dem sources suggested there was a widespread assumption, including among MPs, that Cable would step down once Britain had left the EU. Some MPs believe his authority will start to drain away once it becomes clear he plans to step aside.Cable was business secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. He lost his Twickenham seat in 2015, but regained it in last year’s general election, and took over as party leader from Tim Farron.Farron, who remains an MP, stepped aside in the aftermath of last year’s general election after he was repeatedly pressed during the campaign about his personal beliefs on issues including homosexuality. That year the Lib Dems performed below expectations in what many thought would be a Brexit-focused campaign, returning 12 MPs against the eight of two years earlier.Cable has made keeping Britain in the EU the centrepiece of his policy platform, calling for an “exit from Brexit”. He has also made speeches on other major policy issues, including suggesting a breakup of giant tech companies. Some activists, however, express private concern about his low media profile.The former energy secretary Ed Davey could stand in a future leadership contest, after declining to do so last year for family reasons. Cable’s well-regarded deputy, Jo Swinson, who is currently on maternity leave, is also widely seen at Westminster as a potential successor.Daisy Benson, the party’s former prospective parliamentary candidate for Yeovil, highlighted the Lib Dems’ gains in May’s local elections, in which they took councils including Richmond and Kingston in London, and said she welcomed reforms that could broaden the party’s supporter base.“Our council results are really excellent, but we do need to be a lot more ambitious,” she said.The package of party reforms under consideration has been partly inspired by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party in Canada. Trudeau broadened his party’s supporter base as he swept to power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25fe0ce739808a6a04132552aa509ad29ed5354d/0_360_6101_3661/master/6101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a973d20b173ae1799367a0f8e285c48b","title":"can you solve it a little swedish magic","story":"Gimme, gimme, gimme...a puzzle from StockholmToday, I’ve four puzzles from the country of Abba, courtesy of Swedish magician and puzzle author Fredrik Cattani.

(The Swedish for brainteaser is hjärngymnastik, literally braingymnastics, a much friendlier word.) Cattani likes puzzles that bring people together and provide communal entertainment. Here are four of his favourites. You drop coins into your empty left hand, one at a time. Every time a coin hits another coin you hear a clonk. After four clonks, how many coins do you have in your left hand?An L of a cookie puzzleFour cookies are placed in an L-shape, with three in one row and two in the other. Can you move one cookie so there will be three cookies in each row?There’s a classic puzzle that asks you to make a square with two forks on a table. The solution is to place the two forks perpendicular to each other at corner of the table, and using two sides of the table you create the square. But can you take the same two forks and and make four squares instead? No bending allowed!Thank you for the pencilPut your hands together, with a pencil between your thumbs, as above. Can you twist your hands so you get to the position where the pencil is underneath, as in the second image, resting between your palms and your thumbs?

We need to be particularly alert to this with regard to young people.“The treatments are so serious and life-changing. I’m a little cautious of the use of those treatments because of the potential for the rest of their lives.“Lots of questions are rightly being asked about how we treat young people. People whose bodies perhaps haven’t developed yet.”Fox Fisher, a patron of the LGBT+ helpline, said: “The women’s minister’s concerns need to be put into perspective and she needs to look into the actual reality of treatment given to trans people, and she needs to consult with trans organisations and people that work on the ground.“It is damaging to imply that trans teens are being given treatment lightly, as behind it are decades of research and best practice. Trans people’s lives are at stake here, and we know what we need.”James Morton, the Scottish Trans Alliance manager, said the number of transgender young people was very small and there was an “obsession with their existence” within sections of the media.“Transgender young people remain very rare, despite the current media obsession with their existence. The NHS requires people to be adults before they can get any irreversible gender reassignment treatment.“As Victoria Atkins explores this topic in more depth, I’m confident that she will see through the anti-trans campaigners’ scaremongering and be reassured that the NHS assistance trans youth receive is actually very carefully provided and safe.”Figures released by the Tavistock Clinic, the UK’s main centre specialising in gender issues, show that 2,519 referrals for its young persons’ gender identity development service were received during 201718, around a quarter more than the previous year which had 2,016 referrals.At the time that the figures were disclosed, Dr Polly Carmichael, gender identity development service director at the clinic’s Gender Identity Development Service, said there was “no single explanation for the increase in referral figures”, adding: “There has been significant progress towards the acceptance and recognition of transgender and gender erse people in our society.“There is also greater public knowledge about specialist gender clinics and the pathways into them, and an increased awareness of the possibilities around physical treatments for younger adolescents.”They said: “Why isn’t there a public outcry over the fact that a vulnerable group of children are suffering because we as a society are failing to give them the support that they need?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231cbbd04c923477b70cb95ecb08d185dc6bd9b7/0_234_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce26a3e22d2fe275f3d585087a5396d","title":"alejandro valverde turns back clock second stage vuelta","story":"• 2009 winner beats Michal Kwiatkowski in uphill sprint• Team Sky’s Kwiatkowski takes leader’s red jerseyThe 2009 red jersey winner, Alejandro Valverde of Movistar, rolled back the years at the Vuelta a España on Sunday, beating Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski in an uphill sprint to be crowned king of the Caminito del Rey.However, Kwiatkowski’s second runners-up placing in two days was enough to see him take the overall lead, as a dominant Team Sky looked untroubled by the absence of Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas.Valverde’s win was his 10th Vuelta stage since he made his Grand Tour debut here in 2002. The triumph consolidated the 38-year-old’s status as one of the most successful riders of his generation. “I love La Vuelta,” the Spaniard said afterwards. “The Giro is a beautiful race, the Tour is a beautiful race. But for me La Vuelta is the most beautiful. It’s my home country and winning here is always special.”Kwiatkowski was magnanimous. “The fans enjoyed a Valverde win,” he said with a laugh.The 163.5km stage two began amid the opulence of Marbella, with its marina and countless golf courses. Under a warm sun the 176-rider peloton headed inland, passing picturesque hillside hamlets and imposing wind turbines. A Thomas De Gendt-led breakaway animated early proceedings up the Puerto de Ojén climb, establishing a lead that at one point stretched past three minutes.The time gap diminished as the peloton ascended the sunburnt summit of the Caminito del Rey, famous for a path pinned to the sheer walls of El Chorro gorge – popularly known, until recent repairs, as the world’s most dangerous walkway. The lead group’s numbers dwindled as it headed towards the base of the Caminito for a second and final attempt, ultimately being swamped by the peloton with 19km remaining.The catch precipitated a series of attacks, as Movistar and Sky jostled for position ahead of the decisive climb. Laurens De Plus made an audacious late solo move, but could not hold off Valverde and Kwiatkowski on the final ramp.The general classification contenders Simon Yates, Nairo Quintana and Thibaut Pinot finished safely in the bunch while the pre-race favourite Richie Porte lost over 13 minutes. The Australian was hit by gastroenteritis on the eve of the Vuelta and was in evident pain in the closing kilometres.The Vuelta continues on Monday with a 178.2km stage departing from Mijas on the Andalusian coast. An early category one ascent of the scenic Puerto del Madroño provides the first major climbing test of the Grand Tour, before a false-flat finish in Alhaurín de la Torre offers an opportunity for sprinters and punchers alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5917042ae3cb5bd9f8e484b6ffbfaf921425b2/0_97_3780_2269/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a04b34a3a3140882be3aada712f7d8","title":"andy murray james duckworth us open preview","story":"The Australian leads the former world No 1 five to three in surgeries and feared he would never play againJames Duckworth is another of those fringe players on nodding terms with Andy Murray – who probably knows more about his rivals than anyone on the circuit – but the 26-year-old Australian, who plays him in the first round here on Monday, has one edge over the former world No 1.His list of surgeries outstrips Murray’s by five to three: right foot, February 2017 right shoulder, March 2017 right foot again, August 2017 right foot for a third time, January 2018 and, just for variety, right elbow, February this year. James has spent more time unemployed than Jack Duckworth, which is why his ranking has fallen from a high of 82 in April 2015 to 448.The Duckman, as his friends call him (perhaps not having heard of Jack of Coronation Street legend) has a professional’s sympathy for his opponent’s struggles.He smiled grimly and observed of Murray, with whom he has hit occasionally: “We both have a bit of an understanding of what it’s like to be out of the game for an extended period and we’re trying to get back and getting used to playing matches day in, day out. It can be a tough road with injuries and when you return. It’s on your mind because you don’t know how your body is going to react.”Murray’s woes hit hard in Melbourne eight months ago when his long-time adviser and friend, Dr John O’Donnell, persuaded him to go under the knife to remove a growth from the top of his left hip that had hindered him for nearly nine years. That followed his back surgery after winning Wimbledon for the first time in 2013 and a minor operation late last year to repair a stomach muscle tear.On arrival in New York Murray seemed more certain about playing than a year ago, when he withdrew after the draw was made, then at Wimbledon this summer, when he also pulled out at the last minute. Beset by natural caution and his constant striving for perfection, he would not be persuaded to risk aggravating his problems, although he is as fit now as he has been since his defeat in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in 2017, which ignited his longueur of introspection.Duckworth, who appreciates he is in the tournament only because of the late withdrawal through injury of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, sympathises with Murray and accepts that injuries are the increasingly high price of the more physical modern game.“There were times I feared I wouldn’t play again,” he says. “I had three surgeries on my foot and that was the biggest thing because I couldn’t run, jump or hop – which makes it tough. It was only when I had my last operation on my foot after this year’s Australian Open when I could run around the court to warm up. You don’t really appreciate those sort of things until they’re gone.When fit, he is a fine player – and has a considerably better athletic pedigree than his old Coronation Street rascal namesake. Duckworth’s grandmother, Beryl Penrose, won the singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open in 1955, and, although he has played tennis since he was seven, he always wanted to play rugby league for the Newcastle Knights.An outstanding junior, he reached the 2010 French Open boys semi-finals and was ranked No 7 in the world. On the ATP Tour he beat Gilles Simon (when the Frenchman was No 21 in the world) and Dominic Thiem to break into the top 100 three years ago – although taking only a single game off Roger Federer in Brisbane that summer was a chastening experience.Duckworth says: “My best chance against Andy would have been at Queen’s in his first week back, but he hasn’t played a best-of-five-set match for a long time, so I guess this is as good a time as any. It will still be an uphill battle. I’m not the favourite going in but I’ll compete hard and give myself every chance.”Duckworth’s compatriot Jordan Thompson (who caught Murray cold in the first round at Queen’s Club last year) also has a British opponent on Monday, Cameron Norrie, whose demeanour could not be more at odds with that of his injury-hit colleagues.“Last year I had to qualify,” he said, “so it’s nice to skip that phase and be a bit fresher. I feel good. I’ve had a decent hard-court swing. I made a couple of semis and I’m feeling confident.”Kyle Edmund, the 16th seed and British No 1, begins his campaign on day one against the Italian world No 94, Paolo Lorenzi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e468986d8d200fb6ef742872aa852c385f450998/0_100_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=868bf1e80e0133f0432b3e111cb21298","title":"johanna konta caroline garcia virus us open","story":"• Konta: ‘I’m bunged up but loads better’• British No 1 leads head-to-head 3-2 with GarciaJohanna Konta, struck down by a heavy virus only a week ago, still sounds as if she would be better off watching the US Open on TV than playing the sixth seed, Caroline Garcia, in the first round on Tuesday but she insists she is fit to be a contender.“As you can probably hear, I’m bunged up but loads better,” she said. “I started hitting yesterday, so it’s good.”It has not all been good the past year, though, as the British No 1 has tumbled from No 4 in the world, as a Wimbledon semi-finalist, to 46 in the rankings and is exposed outside the seedings here. Garcia, the stylish French player identified a few years ago by Andy Murray as one to watch, represents a serious threat.Konta beat her in the fourth round during her wonderful Wimbledon run in 2017, having lost to her in three tough sets at Indian Wells that year, and leads their rivalry 3-2.It has been hard to gauge Konta’s game this year, as good performances have not always been rewarded with victory, and some of her losses have been against the game’s best players – including Elina Svitolina, twice, Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitova, Ashleigh Barty, Venus Williams and Jelena Ostapenko. But she also lost against the world No 98, Yulina Putintseva, in the first round of the French Open and had shock setbacks against Fanny Stollar (219), Bernarda Pera (123) and Marketa Vondrousova (54).Then came what should have been a kick-starter win to end them all: 6-0, 6-1 against Serena Williams in the first round in San Jose a month ago. It was the heaviest defeat of the American’s career but Konta’s victory was somewhat diluted when Williams later revealed she had learned 10 minutes before the match that the killer of her half-sister in 2003 had just been released from prison.Konta, obviously unaware of her opponent’s state of mind, said: “I don’t know what goes on in her personal life, so I went out there and did the best that I could. It’s unfortunate if she’s going through something that’s obviously difficult but I didn’t take it as anything negative on myself.”As she correctly pointed out, she can only take care of what happens on her side of the court. The only stage she could meet Serena again in this tournament would be in the final and the path there for both of them looks equally challenging.Nevertheless, while Williams has gone back into cliche mode, talking about obstacles and striving and climbing mountains, the rest of the field are eyeing her with their customary trepidation. If she builds up momentum with a good early run, even though the world No 1, Simona Halep, lurks in her section of the draw, she will be dangerous on her return after two years away.If there is to be a new champion, it is not inconceivable that it could be Aryna Sabalenka, the emotional 20-year-old Belarusian who beat Konta in the first round in Cincinnati this month and lit up Connecticut on Saturday when she won her first WTA title by outclassing Carla Suárez Navarro. That followed fine recent wins against Wozniacki, Karolina Pliskova and Julia Görges. All of a sudden the women’s game is alive with talk of the next rising star.Sabalenka, who serves and hits off the ground with awesome power, enters a main draw here for the first time, seeded 26. She starts against the American Danielle Collins on Tuesday and could play Kvitova in the fourth round.While Konta’s progress has stuttered, Heather Watson’s season has brightened up considerably in recent weeks. She reached the final in Vancouver and she plays on Monday against Ekaterina Makarova after a fine run in the qualifying tournament.“I’ve been focusing on myself and being happy. I’ve been doing a lot of things off the court at tournaments such as sightseeing. It has kept me fresh rather than just practising and then going to bed.“Even now I feel fresh and motivated for my next match. I went canoeing in a river in Vancouver which was very peaceful and relaxing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81eaed16ba3f824476d0e5c6c55ede31833ff9eb/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d670e79bd3bfcc5e565c9586eec2629c","title":"unmissable theatre dance and comedy of autumn 2018","story":"Gender-swapped classics, Hans Christian Andersen’s closet secrets, two giants of US comedy sharing a stage, plus Ralph Fiennes and Sophie Okonedo as rulers in love Twenty years after they made their names, the inidual members of The League of Gentlemen are riding as high as ever – with Inside No 9 a cult smash on BBC2, and Mark Gatiss prominent in practically everything on TV.

At Royal \u0026amp Derngate, Northampton, 1-22 September, (01604 624811) and then on tourA raucous musical comedy based on Aristophanes’ Assemblywomen, in which a coup d’etat ushers in a world of all-female government and economic communism. Blanche McIntyre, as director, has gathered a crack team of writers, including Jenny Eclair, Shappi Khorsandi, Jess Phillips and Natalie Haynes. Lydia Rose Bewley heads a strong cast in a play that seems right for our times. NST City, Southampton, 6-29 SeptemberTo mark the 10th anniversary of Harold Pinter’s death, the Jamie Lloyd Company is staging a hugely ambitious season comprising 20 of the dramatist’s less familiar one-act plays. The venture kicks off with a remarkable quintet including One for the Road and Ashes to Ashes, with a cast headed by Paapa Essiedu and Maggie Steed. Then comes The Lover and The Collection, starring David Suchet, with much more to follow, including Mark Rylance reading Pinter’s 2006 Nobel lecture. Harold Pinter theatre, London, 6 September-23 FebruaryNadia Fall begins her tenure at Stratford East with April de Angelis’s bold reimagining of Lope de Vega’s masterpiece, Fuenteovejuna. The action has been shifted from classical Spain to contemporary India, where a government inspector tyrannises a village and seeks to exercise his seigneurial rights. Anya Chalotra plays the victimised Jyoti and Art Malik plays her tormentor. Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London, from 7 September.David Greig has adapted Joe Simpson’s bestselling 1988 memoir, subsequently filmed, about a near-death climbing experience in the Peruvian Andes and a perilous rescue attempt by Simon Yates. Tom Morris, as director, faces his own challenge in putting mountain-climbing on stage. Bristol Old Vic, from 8 September. Then on tour to Northampton and EdinburghFrom jobbing musical comic to one of Britain’s most prominent political satirists – no one (herself least of all) foresaw Rachel Parris’s elevation to the big league. Her work (with the impro troupe Austentatious, and in her comic-song solo shows) has always been excellent, but it took spoof TV news magazine The Mash Report – and specifically, a few viral sketches on sexual harassment, Piers Morgan and Jacob Rees-Mogg – to secure her the success she deserves. This autumn’s tour synthesises her best songs and standup with the more recent satirist persona. Birmingham Glee Club, 12 September, then touringJeanie O’Hare’s play promises a fresh perspective on The Wars of the Roses in that it makes Margaret of Anjou, Henry VI’s militant queen, the pivot of the action. Jade Anouka, who was part of the Donmar’s all-women Shakespeare trilogy, plays the title role and, in Elizabeth Freestone’s gender-fluid production, Lorraine Bruce is her deadly rival, the Duke of York. Royal Exchange, Manchester, from 14 September.A great love affair or the story of romantic self-delusion? Either way, Shakespeare’s play always grips and offers superb roles for actors. Ralph Fiennes is now the ageing Antony, Sophie Okonedo the Egyptian queen and Tim McMullan Enobarbus at the National Theatre. Simon Godwin, whose impressive recent credits include Twelfth Night and Man and Superman for the National and Hamlet for the RSC, directs this opulent tragedy. National Theatre’s Olivier stage, London, from 18 SeptemberWilliam Golding once claimed that his dystopian fable proved the indestructible nature of the British class system. But it is also a classic story about the myth of childhood innocence and the big twist in Emma Jordan’s revival of Nigel Williams’s adaptation is that the boys will all be played by girls, including Gina Fillingham, Kate Lamb, Lola Adajawho and Hannah Boyce. Theatr Clwyd, Mold, from 20 SeptemberThe work that made Bourne’s name back in 1995, and still one of his best, the male-chorus Swan Lake returns for an extensive national tour. A refresh is promised, but at its core remains the story of a fragile , troubled prince, floored by his love for the elemental Swan. Bourne’s trademark wit is here, but it’s the doomed love story drawing on the beauty and eerie tragedy of Tchaikovsky’s score that’s most affecting. Theatre Royal, Plymouth, from 22 September. Then on tour until MayRona Munro has joined forces with Ian Rankin to bring the latter’s abrasive, hard-drinking Edinburgh detective to the stage in a brand new story. This, however, will be a retired, on-the-wagon Rebus dragged back into sleuthing when the daughter of a murder victim turns up on his doorstep. In a rare return to the stage thriller, Charles Lawson plays Rebus, with John Stahl and Cathy Tyson in support. Birmingham Rep, from 24 SeptemberDougal Irvine has adapted Riaz Khan’s 2012 book which is both a coming-of-age story and a portrait of a hybrid youth culture and the violence surrounding it. Nikolai Foster, who directs, promises a production that will take in both the vibrant Leicester street life of the 1980s and the terraces of the iconic Filbert Street football ground. Curve, Leicester, from 26 SeptemberStephen Sondheim’s superb 1970 musical gets a gender-switch in Marianne Elliott’s new production. The 35-year-old protagonist, unable to settle into marriage or a permanent relationship, is now a woman, played by Rosalie Craig, with other roles adjusted accordingly. Sondheim has given the idea his imprimatur and the strong cast includes Patti Lupone and Mel Giedroyc but, as always, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Gielgud, London, from 26 SeptemberDavid Hare’s 18th play for the National Theatre promises to deal, as so often, with the intersection of the personal and the political. His protagonist, Pauline, is a doctor famed for leading local health campaigns who, through an encounter with an old boyfriend, is offered the chance to stand for public office. To run or not to run? That is the question. Sian Brooke, of Doctor Foster fame, plays Pauline and Australia’s Neil Armfield directs. Lyttelton, London, from 2 OctoberTwo of our finest actors, Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, star in the latest play from Florian Zeller, who enjoyed a big hit with The Father. They play a couple who have been in love for 50 years but who find everything is thrown into question by the arrival of their daughters for a family visit. Amanda Drew, Anna Madeley and Lucy Cohu complete a strong cast, and directed by Jonathan Kent directs. Wyndham’s, London, from 2 OctoberA coming-together of bodies, voices and sounds in this three-way collaboration between National Dance Company Wales, Music Theatre Wales and the London Sinfonietta. French composer Pascal Dusapin’s 2009 dance-opera Passion gets its UK premiere in a new treatment by opera director Michael McCarthy and choreographer Caroline Finn. Dancers embody the story of a couple’s intense love and loss played out across Dusapin’s shifting tensions and textures. Anvil, Basingstoke, 11 October. Then on tour to 12 NovemberTom Burke plays the freedom-fighting Marquis of Posa in a rare revival of Schiller’s magnificent historical drama: one in which political idealism is seen in the context of the titular hero’s love for his stepmother. The production also marks the first venture of a Ara, a new company set up by Burke and Israeli theatre director, Gadi Roll, to offer non-naturalistic stagings of classic plays. Northcott, Exeter, from 11 October. Then touring to Southampton and Kingston.Edmond Rostand’s famous hero with the big conk turns up once more in a legendary Scots translation by Edwin Morgan, premiered by Communicado 25 years ago. The play, with its verbal bravura, physical bravado and theme of unspoken love, never fails to captivate. Brian Ferguson, recently seen in A Number, stars, Dominic Hill directs and Tom Piper designs. Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 12 OctoberYou would have thought Shakespeare’s play, a cynic’s Iliad taking an acerbic view of war and heroism, would have been highly popular today. Yet Gregory Doran’s production will be the first at Stratford since a dismal venture with the Wooster Group in 2012. This time round Doran promises us a version based on gender-equality and close collaboration with the virtuoso percussionist, Evelyn Glennie. Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 12 OctoberJim Broadbent plays Hans Christian Andersen in Martin McDonagh’s new play. But it doesn’t sound like a cosy, Christmas show full of Tommy Steele (who previously played Andersen) jollity. In fact, the suggestion, in a direct echo of Jane Eyre, is that the secret of the Danish fabulist lies in a woman secreted in the attic. Matthew Dunster, who made a brilliant job of McDonagh’s Hangmen, directs this promisingly eerie piece. Bridge theatre, London, from 12 OctoberIt doesn’t get much bigger-hitting than this: a double-bill of two of the world’s (read: America’s) most celebrated comics. As a live act, Dave Chappelle is better known to UK audiences, having visited on several occasions since his career resurgence earlier this decade. The standup of ex-Daily Show host Jon Stewart is less familiar but keenly anticipated. Seeing both of them together – they have been touring together in the US – will be one of the season’s big draws. Albert Hall, London, 21-22 OctoberEver since her debut in 2000 with Two Women, Debbie Tucker Green has written a string of poetic plays that haunt the imagination. In her new piece, which she also directs, she examines the brutal effects of ingrained racism and suggests the time for polite, peaceful protest is past. “Marchin’ days is over, man” is one line from a play that sounds like a call to arms. Jerwood theatre, Royal Court, London, from 25 OctoberAcclaimed last year in Edinburgh, this is gig theatre from the Hull-based company, Middle Child. While Luke Barnes’s words take us from the Cool Britannia of 1997 to today’s Brexit Britain, James Frewer’s live music chimes with the progress of each decade. Paul Smith’s production of a work about lost dreams and vanished hopes had Edinburgh audiences bopping in their seats. Bush, London, from 31 OctoberOne of most talked-about shows on this year’s Edinburgh fringe, from one of the hottest new acts in world comedy, Natalie Palamides’ character comedyclown show Nate is in London for three weeks. Buckle up for a bumpy ride as Palamides’ alter ego flaunts his masculinity, teaches us about consent – then goes on a date. (To treat yourself, book the show alongside Jessie Cave’s equally brilliant Sunrise in the same theatre for the same three weeks.) Soho theatre, London, 13 November-1 DecemberSculptor Antony Gormley has form when it comes to collaborations with dance, and an especially fruitful relationship with Belgian choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. Here he designs two new works with Cherkaoui for Sweden’s GöteborgsOperans Danskompani: Noetic, where pliable carbon-fibre strips make what looks like a giant cat’s cradle, and Icon, in which Gormley heaps three-and-a-half tonnes of clay on to the stage and lets the dancers do the sculpting. Things could get messy. Sadler’s Wells, London, 30 November-1 DecemberOrla O’Loughlin bows out as the Traverse director with a darkly comic play, co-produced with HighTide, by Kieran Hurley, which looks at class and culture today. The story starts with an encounter between Libby, who spends her days writing in New Town cafes, and Declan, who is a talented, impecunious artist with a story to tell. But the play pertinently asks whether there is a degree of exploitation in appropriating someone else’s experience.

Not just to the day job but the baffling, often futile, attempts to claim redress for a ruined trip.As holidays become ever easier to book online, more travellers are finding their idyll becomes a nightmare due to incompetence, indifference or downright fraud. Here are some of the most common problems, and how to put them right.When David Harrison arrived for his return Jet2 flight to Leeds from Paris, passengers were issued with a letter stating that the flight had been cancelled for “unforeseen operational reasons”. They were given the choice of applying at the Jet2 ticket desk for a transfer to the next available flight, or a refund. There is no Jet2 ticket desk at Charles de Gaulle airport, airport staff could not help and calls to Jet2 customer services rang out unanswered.Harrison and his partner eventually paid €460 for a flight to Manchester and then had to pay for a taxi to their car at Leeds airport. He says none of the passengers were offered refreshments or assistance.Jet2 blamed “disruption caused by reasons beyond our control” and told the Observer it would refund “reasonable” costs.Harrison’s is a story that will be familiar to thousands of others who will have been left stranded after their flights were grounded by strike action, or other obstacles.In theory, if the flight was to or from an EU country they are entitled to food, accommodation and travel expenses. They should also receive compensation of up to €600, depending on the length of the delay and the flight, unless it was due to an “extraordinary circumstance” beyond the airline’s control.The EU directive, which sets out these rights, is vague about what constitutes an “extraordinary circumstance”. Recent court rulings have excluded, among other things, wildcat strikes by staff, technical problems and understaffing.In practice, many airlines will employ a range of tactics from silence to duplicity to avoid paying. Some, like Jet2, fail to specify the cause of the cancellation, or provide several differing ones during the course of a claim.If you are delayed three hours or more on an EU flight, check how much you are owed and then write to the airline citing EU directive 2612004. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has a template. Don’t, at this stage, be lured by the many websites offering to claim on your behalf. They’ll take a large cut of any payout.If the airline refuses to pay up, go to the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme they subscribe to. There’s a full list on the CAA website. If, like Jet2, they have refused to sign up to a scheme, the CAA will consider your case. The last resort is to make a small claim through Money Claim Online, which costs £20-£60.A fortnight after returning his Europcar hire vehicle, Andrew Bell was told that he’d been charged £564 for a scratch “between 75-150mm” long. Over the ensuing months, Europcar first claimed it could not process damage claims as it was reviewing its processes and then, that its systems were down. Europcar refunded him after the Observer got involved and admitted photographs had not been retained due to an “administrative error”.Car hire firms are notorious for slapping on unannounced charges. These can be for insurance policies or disputed fuel shortfalls.Most car hire contracts allow firms to help themselves to extras from customer credit cards. If they fail to prove the damage charges to your satisfaction, tell them you are paying “under protest” and try to reclaim from your card issuer via section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The European Car Rental Conciliation Service can help with disputes in Europe. If in the UK, the British Vehicle Renting and Leasing Association runs a government-approved service, but only if the hire company is a member.When Rashid Mahmood and his young family arrived at their hotel in Antalya, Turkey, he was told that it was overbooked and that, despite having prepaid for two rooms through Booking, he would have to go elsewhere.It was 2am and the foursome had to drag their suitcases across town looking for a bed. Booking refused to reimburse him for the £47 room he finally secured, stating that he should have called them from Turkey in the small hours to resolve the problem.

They stood for a moment by the collection of bouquets, wilting in the summer heat, and homemade cards that decorated the entryway of the otherwise nondescript building.Delgado is a clinical researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, where McCain received treatment. She said their politics were not always aligned but she admired his courage – especially as shown in his middle-of-the-night vote last year, to save the Affordable Care Act. She pantomimed the dramatic thumbs-down McCain delivered on the floor of the Senate that doomed a Republican plan to repeal the healthcare law. “That was so courageous,” she said, her voice swelling with emotion. To Delgado, the late senator represented the best of American politics, a dignity and decency she fears is disappearing in an era of opportunism and partisanship. When she heard McCain had died on Saturday, she wept.“He always took the right side, the side of the good people, regardless of his politics,” she said. “It’s going to be very difficult to fill his shoes.”McCain, a Vietnam war hero, two-time presidential candidate and one of the most influential American politicians of his generation, died after a year-long battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer. In a statement, Arizona governor Doug Ducey said McCain will lie in state at the Arizona capitol on Wednesday. It would have been his 82nd birthday. On Thursday, friends, family and dignitaries will celebrate his life and legacy at a public service at North Phoenix Baptist Church.Ducey described the service as a “rare and distinct occurrence for a truly special man”. “John McCain is Arizona, and we will honor his life every way we can,” he added. McCain’s body will then be brought to Washington, where on Friday the Republican will lie in state at the US Capitol. The following day, he will receive a full-dress funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral before he is laid to rest on Sunday at the US Naval Academy cemetery, in Annapolis.McCain was not a native son of Arizona but he represented the state in Washington for more three decades. After he retired from the navy, he remarried and settled in Arizona in the early 1980s. He entered politics almost immediately.“Some old political hack advised John to start slowly,” said Marshall Trimble, the state’s official historian who met McCain when he moved to Arizona nearly 40 years ago. “But that wasn’t his style. He just jumped in. He wasn’t someone who let the grass grow under his feet.”Trimble recalled on of their first meetings, when he led the retired Navy pilot on a horseback ride through the craggy Superstition Mountains. It was clear McCain was far more comfortable in a cockpit than in the saddle. But, Trimble said, he “cowboyed up”. “We were in the saddle all day long and he just stuck right with us. He didn’t complain at all,” he said. “I realized then that he was one tough guy.”During his first run for Congress in 1982, a political opponent accused him of not having roots in the state. The decorated war hero responded – in a line he would reprise again and again – that until moving to Arizona, the longest he had lived anywhere was his “unexpectedly lengthy” stay in Vietnam, at the “Hanoi Hilton”. That settled the issue. McCain served two terms in the House of Representatives, from 1983 to 1986. When Senator Barry Goldwater retired, McCain won his first of six Senate terms.A desire for compromise and willingness to buck his party endeared McCain to independent and even Democratic voters in the state, but it also left him deeply unpopular with a swath of conservatives. In 2014, the state Republican party took the extraordinary step of censuring the senator for what they said was “a long and terrible record of drafting, co-sponsoring and voting for legislation best associated with liberal Democrats”.“It was that independence, that rugged inidualism – he did not march in lockstep with the party line,” Trimble said. Arizona has a rich history of sending “giants” to Washington, Trimble said, and McCain was no exception. Its political lineage includes Goldwater, the senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee, and two other influential US senators, Ernest McFarland and Carl Hayden congressman John Rhodes and supreme court justices William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O’Connor.McCain will be remembered here both admiringly and critically, a war hero and an iconoclast who more than once fell short of his own high standards. The Phoenix New Times, a weekly that was often critical of McCain, said the senator was Arizona’s favorite son but he was certainly her “most fascinating son”.In his final memoir, McCain wrote affectionately about the state, quoting his predecessor, Goldwater, who once described Arizona as “113,400 sq miles of heaven that God cut out”. “I’ve driven through the desert in the spring after a wet winter and gasped at the profusion of color, the mesmerizing beauty of desert wildflower in sudden bloom,” McCain wrote. “I love it so much.”After his diagnosis, McCain retreated to the family’s ranch near Sedona, a sprawling oasis of lush greenery in an otherwise arid state. There amid the sycamores and cottonwoods, a babbling creek and the buzz of the summer cicadas, McCain spent his final days. On Saturday, scores of Arizonans gathered along the Interstate 17 to pay final tribute to the late senator as his hearse passed on its way to Phoenix. Some carried American flags while others held signs that thanked McCain for his service or said simply: “I love you.”Outside his Senate office in Phoenix the next morning, mourners slowly trickled in to pay their respects. On a poster, someone wrote: “Often disagreed, but always respected you. Thank you for your service and leaving our nation better than you found it.”Tina Dennis, of Phoenix, said she was there for “the man, not the politician”. She wanted her 11-year-old son, Anthony Walker, to remember McCain’s sacrifice and his sense of duty.Anthony proudly put a tiny American flag on top of the memorial. He laid a card next to it. Inside, the message said simply: “Miss you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d3bfb87d27600d495ddfc3cc1589d5966ab9d2f/0_149_2251_1351/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ab114b174e00b55b1df46edadfffaff","title":"michael cooper chicago 68 photographs","story":"Michael Cooper was most famous for shooting candid moments with the Rolling Stones and the cover of the Beatles’ 1967 album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Some carry their earthly possessions in suitcases or backpacks, others plastic bags containing water and snacks for the long journey ahead. All share a dogged determination to escape. “Food became so expensive that for months we weren’t able to eat three meals a day,” says Harry Flores, 41, who has been queuing for nine days with his family in the hope of boarding a bus to Peru.When he does secure those seats, Flores, an unemployed computer engineer who sold his car to bankroll the trip, will join a historic exodus from what was once one of South America’s wealthiest and most stable societies. Hundreds more made it into Peru through its northwestern border on Saturday despite new rules preventing Venezuelan migrants from entering without passports, which many lack because of the upheaval in their country. “We must act humanely with this vulnerable population,” said Abel Chiroque, the local ombudsman. Last week the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, vowed to reverse the country’s slide into hyperinflation and deprivation with what he called a visionary plan for recovery, growth and economic prosperity. “This is my economic recovery programme. It’s mine! And when I say it’s mine, I mean: it’s the people’s,’” Maduro tweeted on Wednesday, a day after his country was rocked by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake that some interpreted as a political metaphor for his teetering regime. Few experts believe Maduro’s measures will produce the economic miracle he promises. “There is zero chance it will work,” said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in the US and the co-author of a book on Venezuela’s political and economic decay called Dragon in the Tropics.In Venezuela, the plan has added bewilderment to the growing sense of despair.“When I went to the market today some prices had almost doubled,” complained Edelia Zambrano, a 31-year-old risk analyst from Caracas. Sandra Campos, a 32-year-old accountant, suspected she had been overcharged for her breakfast because of the befuddling new system. “The clerk charged me 50 times the price, because she confused the numbers. There’s too much confusion.” Just this year two plots to bring Maduro down have reportedly been foiled – one in May when a conspiracy involving top military officials codenamed Operation Constitution was thwarted, and another in early August when two explosive-laden drones failed to reach their target during a rally in Caracas. Many of the Venezuelans fleeing abroad are adamant a peaceful solution is no longer possible. “We’ve got to get him out: to eliminate him,” said Carlos Briceño, a 37-year-old from Maracaibo, as he queued to cross from the Colombian border town of Ipiales into Ecuador last week. Harold Antanas Trinkunas, a Venezuela specialist at Stanford University, said such scheming would inevitably persist, meaning Venezuelan and Cuban spies would need to be on constant guard against “outlandish” if amateurish attempts to kill Maduro.If, as seemed likely, Maduro’s economic plan failed to stop the rot an Arab spring-type uprising was also possible which could lead to “a very unpredictable outcome as we saw in the Middle East and North Africa”. Trinkunas added Maduro might also be purged by his inner circle and replaced with “a more competent strongman” such as longtime rival Diosdado Cabello. Corrales also saw the most likely challenge coming from within but said Venezuela’s leadership had proved surprisingly resilient. Maduro is the president of Venezuela. He served as the interim president upon the death of Hugo Chávez in March 2013, and won a hastily arranged general election in April 2013, narrowly defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles.Maduro was previously a bus driver and trade union leader. He was elected to the national assembly in 2000 and was appointed to a number of government positions by Chávez, including foreign ministerThe president, who lacks the charisma of his predecessor, has seen his approval ratings plunge amid widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation. He stands accused of authoritarianism over his crackdowns on protests and attempts to shut off opposition paths to power. He claims he is the target of a US-backed economic war aimed at removing socialist control over the world\u0027s biggest oil resourcesIn the meantime, the daily pilgrimage to the Expresos Flamingo terminal continues, even if buses sometimes fail to arrive because the economic crisis prevents drivers from keeping their vehicles on the road. “The bus company told us to come back tomorrow,” said Johanna Diaz, 25, an unemployed waitress who was trying to reach Ecuador and insisted she would not abandon her place in the queue or quest for a fresh start. “I won’t leave,” Diaz said. “There’s no way I’m losing my spot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35583a34dee6bd60ccc34bd147a13a880567fd7/164_23_1408_845/master/1408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f81d6c2d1199d80e64af44fe268705c","title":"china tibet fresh push against separatist elements religion","story":"Wang Yang urges tight control over Buddhism as Communist party issues fresh rules to crack down on religionA top Chinese leader has called for “advancing anti-separatism efforts” in Tibet, in a sign of continued high-pressure tactics in the Himalayan region.Wang Yang, the Communist party’s No. 4 ranking official, was quoted on Monday in state media as stressing the importance of tight control over Tibet’s Buddhist institutions, urging “preparedness and precautions for danger in times of safety”.Religious figures must “be courageous to battle all separatist elements” in the name of preserving national unity and social stability, Wang was quoted as saying in Tibet’s regional capital of Lhasa during a visit there on Sunday.Wang’s comments came as the Communist party issued a revised set of regulations governing members\u0027 behaviour, threatening punishment for spreading political rumours and recommending that those who cling to religious beliefs be asked to leave the party.\u0026nbspPresident Xi Jinping\u0027s ongoing crackdown against deep-rooted corruption, begun six years ago when he took office, has shaken up the party, with Xi warning, like other leaders before him, that the party\u0027s very survival is at stake.\u0026nbspParty members are not allowed to speak out against central party policies or decisions, and they cannot spread political rumours or damage the party\u0027s unity, the new rules say.\u0026nbspParty members and officials must correctly exercise the power granted them by the people, be clean and upright, and oppose any abuse of power or behaviour that seeks personal benefit, one new clause said.\u0026nbspAnother new clause targets party members who are religious.

If they still don\u0027t change after help and education from the party organisation, they should be encouraged to leave the party, the new rules said.\u0026nbspBeijing’s forces occupied Tibet shortly after the 1949 communist revolution and security there has been ratcheted up significantly in the decade since anti-government protests spread through Tibetan areas in 2008.The tactics in Tibet are largely aimed at reducing the influence of the region’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for more than seven centuries and regards the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.Many Tibetans insist they were essentially independent for much of that time.Wang has broad responsibility for religious policy as head of the government’s top political advisory body. In his comments on Sunday, he also echoed Beijing’s calls for the sinicization of religion, shorthand for adherence to the dictates of the officially atheist party.As part of recent tightening of security measures in Tibet, students were required to sign agreements to “not take part in any form of religious activity” during the school summer holidays.Young Tibetan monks have also reportedly been forced to leave one of the biggest monasteries in a Tibetan region of western China as part of a drive to replace monastic life with secular education.Recent months have also seen sweeping crackdowns on traditional Muslim culture among the Uighur ethnic minority group in the north-western region of Xinjiang and among Christians in eastern China.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f8e1966643e9ae711a3508167d9bbfa0a31ffab/273_383_1084_651/master/1084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe28d7aa25d371b10103351a1a91facd","title":"flight times extended by major airlines to avoid payouts report claims","story":"Carriers add up to 30 minutes to trips, reducing the likelihood of paying compensation for delays, Which? says Plane journeys are taking longer than a decade ago, according to a report that claims the change is down to airlines “padding” their schedules to create the impression passengers were reaching their destinations on time.Carriers are adding extra time to flight schedules, in some cases up to 30 minutes, to ensure they maintain punctuality and are therefore less likely to be liable for compensation payouts, the investigation by Which? Travel claimed.The majority of flight routes are advertised as taking longer than 10 years ago, despite improvements in aircraft technology, the report found.BA flights from Heathrow to Bangkok, New York and Singapore were extended by 20 minutes, and a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow to Newark Liberty airport, New Jersey, now takes an average of 35 minutes longer.Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, said: “Passengers are likely to feel that schedule padding is another case of airlines pulling the wool over their eyes.“Carriers are quick to claim that adding 10, 20 and even 30 minutes to flights will improve on-time performance. The accompanying slump in punctuality over recent years suggests it hasn’t helped much.“Instead, longer scheduled flight times are likely to mean passengers spend more time sitting around at the gate or on the plane itself, just so the airline can pat itself on the back for being ‘on time’ at your destination.“Conveniently, it could also reduce the number of instances when an airline has to pay you compensation for a flight delay.”Keith Mason, professor of air transport management at Cranfield University, told Which? that airlines regularly adjusted scheduled flight times to give themselves some “wiggle room”.Despite the changes in scheduling, some of Europe’s largest carriers have seen punctuality fall in recent years.Airlines told the consumer magazine their aircraft were flying at slower speeds to reduce fuel consumption and that this allowed them to offer cheaper fares.BA also told Which? that air traffic control congestion was a factor, with European skies now much busier than 10 years ago, while previous flight taxi times had been “too optimistic”.European Union rules stipulate that passengers can claim up to €600 (£540) if their flights is delayed by more than three hours however, airlines do not have to compensate travellers for circumstances outside their control, such as bad weather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56290fb0ba52a83e477420ebefd0d96e849d480/0_94_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa1889d1fffc3936cf33896079d8b0b","title":"myanmars military accused of genocide by damning un report","story":"Mission concludes army have carried out ‘gravest crimes’ against Rohingya in Rakhine and minorities elsewhereA damning UN report has accused Myanmar’s military of genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine state, and alleged that the army were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity against minorities across the country.A fact-finding mission on Myanmar compiled conclusive evidence that what its military, known as the Tatmadaw, had carried out “undoubtedly amounted to the gravest crimes under international law” in Rakhine, home to the Muslim Rohingya, but also in Kachin and Shan states which are riven by internal conflicts.The UN investigators were denied access to Myanmar by the government but interviewed many who had fled the country. They found that the military were “killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children and burning entire villages” in Rakhine, Shan and Kachin. They also carried out murders, imprisonments, enforced disappearances, torture, rapes and used sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and enslavement – all of which constitute crimes against humanity.In northern Rakhine, the mission also found evidence of mass extermination and deportation, both defined as crimes against humanity by the UN.The mission, prompted by the UN security council visit in March, called for an investigation into the military over the genocide in Rakhine. The campaign of violence against the Rohingya began exactly a year ago. An estimated 25,000 have been killed and 700,000 have fled over the border to Bangladesh.Laying out the legal argument for genocide to have taken place, the UN report stated that “the crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts”.Specific iniduals were singled out for investigation and prosecution for genocide and crimes against humanity, namely Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw, who has openly stated his intention to solve “the long-standing Bengali problem”.“There is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state,” stated the report.The mission also backed calls for Myanmar to be investigated by the international criminal court (ICC), though as Myanmar is not a signatory to the Rome statute, and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the court, ICC prosecutors are deliberating over whether they can investigate the violence in Rakhine.The UN report is sure to rile Myanmar’s military and government, who have denied that genocide occurred in Rakhine and claimed that the Rohingya – who they regularly refer to as “illegal Bengali immigrants” – instigated the violence by attacking the security forces and then burned their own villages to the ground. Both the military and the civilian government, led by Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, have stated that the military’s actions were an appropriate response to “terrorists”.The Tatmadaw’s own investigation, widely considered a farce, cleared the military of all wrongdoing and the head of Aung San Suu Kyi’s newly established inquiry into Rakhine recently stated that there will be no “finger-pointing, blaming, to say ‘you’re accountable’.”The UN stated that, with Myanmar’s repeated failure to admit that genocide had taken place and with the legal impunity given to the military, it now fell to the international community to hold those responsible to account.“Theresa May must now support the referral of Burma to the international criminal court,” said Mark Farmaner, Director of Burma Campaign UK in response to the UN mission. “By not supporting referring Burma to the international criminal court, Theresa May is in effect protecting Min Aung Hlaing and his military from attempts to bring them to justice.”"},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man (56) held after haul found in a house at Colbert Park in JanesboroResearchers say new drug lorcaserin does not increase risk of serious heart problemsArchbishop says Francis knew of sexual misconduct allegations against Theodore McCarrickPrivacy experts concerned about \u0026lsquochilling effect\u0026rsquo if people\u0026rsquos online activity is recordedFirm earlier admitted it had agreed to underwrite the cost of submitting the lettersDespite the rain, thousands turn out to greet the pope at the Marian ShrineEstimate puts attendance at Phoenix Park Mass at 130,000, far less than expectedMost departments have no chargers despite urging others to go greenPope dismissive on flight from Ireland to Rome of claims by Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganoBefore leaving Ireland, Pope tells bishops they must address clerical abuse with honesty, courageStand For Truth rally at Garden of Remembrance began at same time as the papal MassAlison Nevin took snap when at Croke PArk as representative of Traveller communityNames of 796 infants buried in Tuam read aloud at site of former Mother and Baby homePeople may have come into contact with antibiotic resistant CPE while in hospitalItalian government had not let group leave the Diciotti unless other EU countries took themSimon Coveney says it is hard to believe a senior politician is so ill informed about IrelandMarie Collins asked pope why Church is still allowing disgraced church leaders resign instead of being firedPontiff tells single mothers separated from children that to seek them is \u0026lsquonot a mortal sin\u0026rsquoScience and religion make strange bedfellows, one big clash being the central issue of faith\u0026lsquoNone of us can fail to be moved by the stories of young people who suffered abuse\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3608345.1535361238!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"supermac s requests garda inquiry into forged letters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupermac’s on Westmoreland Street, Dublin.

Photograph: Andrew HarnikPool ReutersNorth Korea’s state-controlled newspaper on Sunday accused the United States of “double-dealing” and “hatching a criminal plot” against Pyongyang, after Washington abruptly cancelled a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Negotiations have been all but deadlocked since US president Donald Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June.Mr Pompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea’s abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own.North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said US special units based in Japan were staging an air drill aimed at “the infiltration into Pyongyang”, citing a South Korean media outlet.“Such acts prove that the US is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK and commit a crime which deserves merciless ine punishment in case the US fails in the scenario of the DPRK’s unjust and brigandish denuclearisation first,” the paper said.“We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the US as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,” it noted.A spokesman at the US embassy in Seoul said he had no information on the drill alleged in the newspaper. The US military spokesman in South Korea was not available to comment.The editorial, which did not mention the Pompeo visit, urged Washington to give up the “pointless military gamble” and implement the Singapore agreement, in which the leaders pledged to work towards a complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.Since the summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North’s nuclear weapons programme.Pyongyang is calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearisation.In part to reassure North Korea, Mr Trump cancelled or delayed joint military drills with South Korea, but smaller exercises continue.Mr Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. China expressed “serious concern” about Mr Trump’s comments, which it called “irresponsible”. – (Reuters)Historic meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Security Council with veto power over whether the issue will be brought before the ICC, has been reticent about condemning Myanmar\u0027s government during the crisis.UN officials and human rights watchers have for months pointed to evidence of genocide in Myanmar, and the United States late last year said that ethnic cleansing was occurring in Myanmar.Rohingya Muslims driven from Burma, in picturesBut few experts have studied the issue as in-depth and in such an official way as the fact-finding team, with a mandate from a body that has Myanmar\u0027s approval: The country is among the 47 members of the Human Rights Council.The United Nations does not apply the word genocide lightly. The fact-finding team\u0027s assessment suggests the crimes against the Rohingya could meet the strict legal definition - which was last met over crimes in Bosnia and Rwanda nearly a quarter-century ago.Human rights watchers say determining genocidal intent is perhaps the most difficult criteria to meet: In essence, it\u0027s the task of assessing the mindsets of perpetrators to determine if ethnicity, race, religion or another attribute had motivated them.The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts, the report said, alluding to a region of Myanmar that is home for many Rohingya.Adding into their assessment: The extreme brutality of the crimes hate rhetoric and specific speech by perpetrators and military commanders policies of exclusion against Rohingya people an oppressive context and the level of organization indicating a plan for destruction.The investigators cited six Myanmar military leaders by name as priority subjects for possible prosecution, led by the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing.A longer list of names is to be kept in the office of the U.N. human rights chief for possible use in future judicial proceedings.The United States and European Union have already slapped sanctions on some Myanmar military leaders, though Min Aung Hlaing is not among them.The authors called for the creation of a special body, or mechanism, to keep watch on the still-evolving human rights situation in Myanmar.They said the United Nations\u0027 own role in the country since 2011 should be reviewed to see if the world body did all it could to prevent such a crisis.They also faulted Aung San Suu Kyi for not using her role as head of Myanmar\u0027s government, nor her moral authority - she is a Nobel peace prize laureate - to stop the events in embattled Rakhine state. Murder hunt after mother and daughter killed in SolihullKSI v Logan Paul: Call that entertainment?

He would die in July of 1890. Bailey found contemporary press reports which record that Carnot spent over an hour at the  exhibition, escorted by the painter Paul Signac, a friend of the Van Gogh brothers.Theo Van Gogh, in a portrait by his brother, VincentSignac, then  among Vincent’s ardent admirers, had visited him in hospital in Arles the previous year. Vincent’s ten paintings were “well placed” in the Paris exhibition, according to Theo.Bailey, who has written several books about Van Gogh and is co-curating a Tate Britain’s exhibition of the artist’s work next year, said: “During the 20th century, as Van Gogh’s fame steadily grew, the legends around him developed.It so often said that he was ignored during his lifetime, as evidenced by the fact that he only succeeded in selling a single painting. “He may have failed to sell, but I believe that he was beginning to gain recognition, at least in avant-garde circles in Paris - which was then the art capital of the world.“I have long suspected it was a myth that Van Gogh was ignored - and the Salon des Indepéndants exhibition and the visit by the French president suggests that he was beginning to win some acceptance.“Fresh research for my new book ‘Starry Night’ shows that Van Gogh’s paintings were almost certainly seen during his lifetime by the president of France, Sadi Carnot.“Once one sees Van Gogh as an artist who was beginning to become appreciated, it is easier to understand why his work had such an influence on the artists to come, in the 1890s and the early 1900s, and to appreciate why he played such a key role in the development of Modern art.“Had his life not come to a tragic end, at the age of 37 in 1890, he would have continued to develop - and he would soon have begun to be regarded as a genius.“We need to break away from the myths that surround Van Gogh, and try to look afresh at his work.”Starry Night: Van Gogh at the Asylum tells the story of the artist’s year at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, and is published on MondayPlease review our commenting policyMurder hunt after mother and daughter killed in SolihullKSI v Logan Paul: Call that entertainment?

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click

funding after no-deal BrexitBritain stands to lose around half a billion pounds of annual European science funding in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jeopardising research into cancer and other health treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor

community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

forecast eu latest secretary tory government economy","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsThe Treasury is warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP from a no-deal Brexit - and an £80bn black hole in the public financesBrexit secretary contradicts government forecast of economic hit from no-deal EU exit, setting up clash with HammondDominic Raab has dismissed his own government’s forecast of huge economic damage from crashing out of the EU without a deal, insisting most such predictions “prove to be wrong”.The Brexit secretary set up a clash with Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, by rejecting his warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP and an £80bn black hole in the public finances.The projection is the Treasury’s own analysis of the impact of a no-deal Brexit over the next 15 years – because of the loss of market access to the EU and chaos at Britain’s borders.But, asked about the stark warning, Mr Raab said: “I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.”Speaking to The Sunday Times, he added: “We need to treat some of the forecasts with a measure of caution”, before claiming that estimates of economic growth next year “have been revised up”.In fact, the Bank of England has cut its GDP forecast for 2019 to 1.7 per cent – well below the pre-referendum growth rate – and warned “the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties”.In the interview, Mr Raab also brushed off polling evidence of growing public unease about the prospects for Brexit, as the negotiations remain deadlocked.“The majority of people think Britain will be better off\u0026nbsplong term\u0026nbspfor leaving the EU. People think, just get on and deliver it. That\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do,” he insisted.Last week, Mr Hammond triggered renewed Tory infighting – and Brexiteer calls for him to be sacked – when he confirmed the Treasury’s fears about a no-deal exit.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIn a letter to the Treasury committee, he said the analysis showed “GDP would be 7.7 per cent lower (range 5.0 per cent to 10.3 per cent) relative to a status quo baseline”.And he added: “GDP impacts of this magnitude, were they to arise, would have large fiscal consequences.”Nicky Morgan, the committee’s Tory chairwoman, leapt on the conclusions, saying: The chancellor has confirmed that the government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”But the intervention came just hours after Mr Raab attempted to reassure the public over a disorderly exit, even citing “opportunities” that could arise.\u0027University research projects at risk of collapse amid no-deal Brexit\u0027No-deal Brexit \u0027will be blocked by at least 40 Tory MPs\u0027Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealThe Tories\u0027 plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any moreIn the interview, Mr Raab hinted at warm relations with Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator. After meeting again this week, he will have spent more time with him than the seven hours David Davis, his predecessor, did this year.“I think he\u0027s a steely interlocutor he knows what he\u0027s seeking to achieve,” the Brexit secretary said.“Equally, behind closed doors he\u0027s very warm. We talk about family. I do think getting to know the other side on a personal level helps. You have to understand what the other side is thinking, what the pressures on them are.“He\u0027s a very personable guy –\u0026nbsphe\u0027s invited me and my wife, Erika, down to his farm.

It’s a huge question.”Pressed on whether he believed the prime minister could get a deal through the chamber, he added: “I think it’s very unlikely she’ll get a deal through the House of Commons.”Lord Heseltine said that for months he has been saying there “had to be a second test of public opinion” either through a general election or a second EU referendum.“I think probably a referendum,” he said when asked which he would prefer. “It’s one or the other. Events will dictate which it is.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union While the prime minister has categorically ruled out a second referendum “under any circumstances”, Labour has left the option on the table should parliament reject Ms May’s agreement with the EU or if a no-deal Brexit is looming.On Friday, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies,\u0026nbspsaid Labour would rule nothing out – echoing comments made by his frontbench colleague Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspthe previous day.Referring to Mr Johnson’s column in the Daily , in which the former foreign secretary said those wearing niqabs resembled “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”, Lord Heseltine\u0026nbspadded: “I think he should apologise.“My concern is the ripple effect. If people like him start using language that stimulates the worst elements of racism, it licences people to go further with impunity. ‘If Boris can say it, I can say it’. It becomes the sort of slogan of the racist element of the right wing.”He suggested there could only be two explanations for the contentious column that attracted widespread criticism. “One is that it’s a mistake and if it’s a mistake he could say so. The other is that he calculates it would advance his street cred with the right wing of the Tory party. And I think it’s possible he’s right with that judgement.”Asked whether he believed it was likely Mr Johnson would challenge the prime minister for leadership of the Conservative Party, Lord Heseltine added: “I think it’s much more likely that events will dictate the pace of change.“I would not expect him to make a decisive move – the move may be made inevitable by vacuums or by other people signing letters of no confidence, all these sorts of things, or by losses of votes in the House of Commons.“There has never been in my view such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing us.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/18/front-theresa-may-scotland.jpg","title":"theresa may subsaharan africa visit trade security brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.Downing Street stresses\u0026nbsp\u0027mutual benefits\u0027 of strengthened ties with the continent – ahead of visit to\u0026nbspSouth Africa, Nigeria and Kenya\u0026nbspClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May will lead a 29-strong delegation of business leaders, exhibiting \u0027British expertise\u0027Theresa May will vow to help Africa achieve “its incredible potential” when she jets in for a three-day trip this week.The prime minister will make her first visit to sub-Saharan Africa, for talks focusing on trade and security in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.Ms May will lead a 29-strong delegation of UK business leaders\u0026nbspexhibiting “British expertise in technology, infrastructure, and financial and professional services”, Downing Street said.Despite the looming challenge of Brexit,\u0026nbspNo\u0026nbsp10 is keen to stress the “mutual benefits” of strengthened ties with a continent boasting four of the world’s six most dynamic economies.The visit is also likely to be viewed as a riposte to Emmanuel Macron, with\u0026nbspthe French president\u0026nbsptargeting Africa in his soft power mission to boost Paris’s global influence.\u0026nbspExplaining the trip, Ms May\u0026nbspsaid the decision to leave the EU meant it was “time for the UK to deepen and strengthen its global partnerships”.“Africa stands right on the cusp of playing a transformative role in the global economy and, as longstanding partners, this trip is a unique opportunity at a unique time for the UK to set out our ambition to work even closer together,” she said.“A more prosperous, growing and trading Africa is in all of our interests, and its incredible potential will only be realised through a concerted partnership between governments, global institutions and business.”It will be the first trade visit to sub-Saharan Africa by a British prime minister since 2011 – a trip\u0026nbspDavid Cameron was forced to cut short because of the phone hacking crisis.UK news in picturesThe crowd pauses for 72 seconds silence in remembrance of all those lost in the Grenfell Tower fire at the Red Bull Music Academy Sound System at Notting HillComedian Rose Matafeo is congratulated by Steve Coogan after winning the Edinburgh Comedy Award at the Dovecote StudioBritish Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, attends a signing ceremony for memorandums of understanding between British and Chinese firms and institutions at the British ambassador\u0027s residence in BeijingNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe hugs her daughter Gabriella, in Iran.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesRohingya refugees during a protest march after attending a ceremony to remember the first anniversary of a military crackdown that prompted a massive exodus of people from Myanmar to Bangladesh, at the Kutupalong refugee camp in UkhiaUS President Donald Trump sits with children during a tour of Nationwide Children\u0027s Hospital in Columbus, OhioAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, AustraliaHigh waves hit Jeju Island, South Korea, as powerful Typhoon Soulik gradually approaches the Korean PeninsulaA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And since 2000 our population has soared by more than seven million — more than 80 per cent of it directly due to immigration, according to Migration Watch.The Sun is not criticising the migrants themselves. Quite the reverse. The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers. But the scams grow more and more credible and sophisticated. It’s easier than ever to be taken in and plenty are.The Financial Ombudsman argues that it’s unfair to assume victims are “grossly negligent”, and we agree.The onus must be on banks to beef up their security processes and software to keep our funds safe — as well as to keep hammering home to all customers the risk in handing over information.Last year only a quarter of the £240million stolen got refunded.That represents a shameful shirking of responsibility.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a iation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a real concern about safety.”One of the region’s MPs is Luciana Berger, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, has repeatedly been targeted for abuse.The former shadow minister for public health said she felt “unwelcome” in her own party after Mr Corbyn’s recent “inexcusable comments”.In response to the official complaint a party source told the Observer they were not aware of it, but a Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party’s complaints procedure operates confidentially in the interests of fairness to all concerned.“This is to ensure protection of the personal data both for any members who make complaints, and for those to whom complaints relate.“This enables procedures to be followed properly.

We can be the catalyst for a worldwide Commonwealth trade deal with none of disadvantages of the EUs attempt to run Britain from Brussels.”The country’s former Vice President added: “My sincere belief is that Brexit can be a great force for good. It could blow down barriers which have prevented Nigeria and other countries from grasping their potential.”He went on: “time and again we are hit by EU tariffs on products such as sugar cane and rice. This is aimed at protecting European producers, often for products which are not farmed in Britain.”Downing Street hope the visit will help the UK forge better trade links with the continent that is home to 16 per cent of the world’s population but just three per cent of international trade.Mrs May will use a speech in Cape Town on Tuesday to make her pitch, saying: “Africa stands right on the cusp of playing a transformative role in the global economy, and as longstanding partners this trip is a unique opportunity at a unique time for the UK to set out our ambition to work even closer together.“A more prosperous, growing and trading Africa is in all of our interests and its incredible potential will only be realised through a concerted partnership between governments, global institutions and business.”Representatives from export giants JCB, Scotch whisky producers and infrastructure chiefs will travel with the PM.As will City bosses and the Lord Mayor of London.More than 640 troops, mostly black South Africans, died when the SS Mendi perished in the English Channel in 1917.They were on their way to join the Allied forces on the Western Front in World War One.It collided with a Royal Mail boat off the Isle of Wight, but no assistance was given to drowning victims.The bell has become a symbol of the South Africa’s First World War remembrance and protest at racial inequality.The recovered bell was donated anonymously to the BBC last year after the wreck was discovered in the 1970sMrs May will present it to President Ramaphosa in a ceremony at Cape Town on Tuesday – over a century after it was lost in a shipwreck.In 1995 the Queen and then South African leader Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the “delusional”.He hit back at Brussels, telling The Sun: “It is wishful thinking by a EU establishment that has failed to notice that its grand scheme has failed economically, is devoid of democratic support and is increasing unpopular across the continent.EU sources also questioned Brexit secretary Dominic Raab’s upbeat assessment of how the UK would cope in the first few weeks of a no deal outcome. One said they “wouldn’t count on” his reassurance that Brits will still be able to enjoy a BLT sandwich in such a scenario.Last week the Government published a slew of notices warning people and businesses how to prepare for a crash out situation in March next year.Announcing them, Mr Raab dismissed suggestions the army and Air Force would have to be deployed to secure food and medicine supplies as “scare stories”. And in a bizarre pledge, he said Brits will “still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit”.But asked whether the UK Government could survive the first few days of a no deal exit, an EU ambassador told The Sun: “It’s not possible to have a no deal. There would be a massive outcry.“With even a no deal for one week, with no flights to and from the UK, no ships, imagine the economic loss of one week of no economic activity, no personal activity, no financial transactions. That would already be a disaster.”The diplomat added that Britain’s sluggish economic growth over the past year meant it was already “falling behind more and more” compared to the rest of the continent.The EU Commission has slashed its growth forecast for the UK to just 1.3 per cent for 2018, the joint lowest rate alongside struggling Italy.And EU officials believe that business pressure on Ministers to reach a compromise and avoid a crash out will crescendo in the next few months.A senior EU official told The Sun: “The moment the markets understand this is going in the wrong way, the cycle of negotiations and the political dynamics will be taken over by the real world.“In a few months the UK will have a credibility issue. The moment economic operators understand this is going wrong there will be events on the ground.”Meanwhile a former EU chief sparked outrage yesterday by claiming a no deal Brexit would trigger the break-up of the UK.Former European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said: “We could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a ‘no deal’ is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.”THE Eurocrats are losing the plot.We’re used to their regular predictions that Britain will turn into the 10th circle of hell once we leave the EU. But even we’re taken aback by the ridiculous warning that we’ll have “no economic activity” the day after a clean break Brexit.These bizarre forecasts show the arrogance of those who rise to the top of the European tree.They genuinely believe that without their flag, their bureaucracy and their anthem that the continent will just fall apart.And it reveals their motives in the Brexit negotiations. To punish us, and send a message to anybody thinking of heading for the exit door – no matter how disastrous it is for the European economy.How are we supposed to negotiate in good faith? They can barely conceal their hope that the UK is going to slip into anarchy.The Government must continue to plan for a clean break. And treat everything Brussels says with not so much a pinch but a whole bucketload of salt.Meanwhile, for all their cocksure bravado, the EU is in all sorts of trouble.Unelected bosses in Brussels are in open warfare with the elected leaders of Poland and Hungary and are now fixing for a fight with Italy, too.Even the EU’s so-called ‘triumph’ in Greece will ring hollow to the 40% of youngsters there who are still out of work.Some ardent Remainers at home are still hoping that Britain might change its mind on leaving.But Brussels keeps proving that we’re better off out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But despite this, the pensions are unfunded - meaning the whole bill has to be paid out of general taxation.Government liabilities for all exisitng unfunded pension obligations was a staggering £1.7 trillion in 2017. This is nearly as much as Britain’s official national debt of £1.8 trillion.The Taxpayers’ Alliance has called on ministers to stop raiding private pension pots and start funding public sector pensions to narrow the gap.Total pay in the public sector - including the value of pension contributions and bonuses, is on average 23 per cent higher than the private sector for comparable workers.Taxpayers’ Alliance boss John O’Connell blasted: “Workers in the private sector are paying for their public sector counterparts to enjoy a retirement they can only dream of, and that disparity has been brutally compounded over the years by politicians continuously launching raids on private pensions.“What’s more, pension promises made to public sector workers are unfunded and will continue to be paid out of general taxation - that is unsustainable as people are living a lot longer than when these schemes were cooked up.“To stop kicking the can down the road, reforms must ensure that new public sector pensions are properly funded and not paid for by the taxpayers of the future, namely our children and grandchildren.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I feel healthier and I feel like I have more energy throughout the day.“That was no way to live. I was eating candy to keep myself going. I had three cavities as a kid.”His mum Christiane, 45, has noticed a drastic change in his personality since taking up the new diet.She thinks he has been much more outgoing and friendlier than he had been lately.She said: “It’s incredible how much he has changed. He’s been more outgoing and he’s helping me with things around the house.“He recently went out to eat with his father.

Negotiations would be made more difficult if the EU takes a hard line in the event of a fractious no-deal Brexit, it adds.There are also three “reasons for optimism” that the worst-case scenario would not be realised, it found.The UK is a world leader in aviation, which means it has “plenty of leverage” as the largest market in Europe and the third largest in the world.The report also says there are strong mutual interests in a beneficial arrangement: “Grounding UK airlines would be hugely damaging for the EU economy, particularly in areas like tourism.“And, of course, foreign airlines presumably want to continue to fly to and from the UK as well.“Since these agreements are reciprocal, it is unlikely that other countries would deny the UK the most important rights when they would then almost certainly lose them too.”It continues: “Third, even if this is left to the last moment, there are several quick fixes.“In particular, the UK and EU [or a third country like the US] could agree at least a temporary extension of the current arrangements by something as simple as a memorandum of understanding.“The key question for the EU is whether the necessity of keeping planes flying outweighs any threats to the integrity of the single market or the risks of giving the UK special treatment - the answer must surely be ‘yes’.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The US Senator, 81, passed away at home, just a day after his family announced he had stopped treatment for the aggressive brain cancer he had battled for a year. As America mourned the loss of McCain today, politicians from across the divide were united in praising the father of five. Yet Donald Trump, who was often at loggerheads with fellow Republican McCain, failed to honour his achievements and only offered sympathy to the family. A statement from McCain’s office stated he died on Saturday at 4.28pm, with wife Cindy and other close family present. It added: “At his death, he had served the United States of America faithfully for 60 years.” Cindy, 64, paid tribute saying: “My heart is broken.  “I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of knowing this incredible man for 38 years. He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.” Former President Barack Obama, who triumphed over McCain in the 2008 election, led tributes from the world of politics. He said: “John McCain and I were members of different generations, from completely different backgrounds and competed at the highest level of politics. “But we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher – the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed. We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege.”  Both men were known for their dignity during the 2008 race for the White House. At some Republican rallies, crowds disparaged black people and Muslims. But when a woman said she did not trust Obama because “he’s an Arab”, McCain replied: “No, ma’am. He’s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.” Former President George W Bush, who defeated McCain for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, called his former rival a “man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order”. And the Prime Minister Theresa May hailed McCain as a “great statesman, who embodied the idea of service over self”. Tony Blair described him as “a good friend, a gifted politician and an even better man”.  The former PM said: “In a world searching for examples of political integrity, he was such an example and a supreme one at that. “His many friends this side of the Atlantic will miss him greatly.” Such tributes were in stark contrast to the words of serving President Trump, who has been banned from the funeral. Trump tweeted: “My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you.” The feud between Trump and McCain dated back to 2015 when the billionaire announced he was running for President and called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug runners during a speech. The Senator distanced himself from the remarks, saying in an interview he disagreed with the Apprentice star’s comments.  Trump hit back by calling McCain “incompetent” before later attacking his military record, criticising the war hero for being taken prisoner in Vietnam. “He’s a war hero because he was captured,” the future President told a campaign crowd. “I like people who weren’t captured.” Trump famously dodged the draft for military service five times saying he suffered “bone spurs” in one of his heels. But Arizona senator McCain refused to attack Trump personally for avoiding \u0026shymilitary service. He once said: “I don’t consider him so much a draft dodger as I feel the system was so wrong that certain Americans could evade their responsibilities to serve the country.”  Last year, in what appeared to be an attack on Trump, McCain gave a speech saying: “To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as \u0026shyunpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.” McCain was born at a Panama naval station in 1936. His father, also named John, and grandfather were both four-star admirals. The younger McCain continued the family’s military tradition by becoming a US Navy pilot.  Disaster struck in 1967 when he was shot down and captured by the North Vietnamese. As his father was commander of all US forces in the Pacific, McCain became the most famous prisoner of war. He was subjected to horrendous torture, yet he refused early release, fearing the enemy would use it for \u0026shypropaganda. He finally came home as a hero in 1973 on crutches, permanently disabled. McCain later turned to politics and settled in Arizona, winning two terms in the House of \u0026shy\u0026shyRepresentatives, from 1983 to 1987, and six in the Senate.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used to call out “Number 10, Wilson’s Den” in Great Yarmouth. He spent three teenage years in a Catholic seminary before, as he puts it, discovering women – so celibacy went bang out of the window. Now, he is reasserting his position as leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest comrade. The Liverpool-born MP for Hayes and Harlington in West London is overseeing the party’s preparations for government, as they sense the Tories’ collapse is imminent amid an uncivil war over Brexit. “I had been saying pessimistically that the Tories would cling on to office,” he told me. “Now, I think anything can happen.” McDonnell is the architect of Labour’s alternative economic plan to boost living standards by ending Conservative austerity.  And he has lined up meetings next month with bankers Goldman Sachs and Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, as well as trade unionists Len McCluskey, Dave Prentis and Tim Roache to fine-tune Labour’s policies. The party’s plan to hike taxes for high earners and big corporations was a 2017 masterstroke that he’ll repeat in the next election manifesto. Once the fearsome “Mac the Knife”, McDonnell has recently morphed into a peacemaker.

Thousands have demanded cash from the controversial payday loans firm over astronomical interest rates. Wonga had charged up to 5,853% before being ordered to stop. Labour’s Meg Hillier said: “There will not be many tears if Wonga goes.” The firm, which lends to the needy, said it was “assessing all options”. Wonga could call in administrators this week as it buckles under a flood of customer compensation claims, it was reported tonight. Tens of thousands of people are seeking payouts after getting loans that dragged them further into debt.  The Financial Conduct Authority imposed a cap on payday lending charges in 2014 and ordered firms to make amends to borrowers charged sky-high rates on short-term loans. But the Mirror revealed recently millions of pounds in payouts has yet to be claimed with lenders such as Wonga accused of dragging their heels on paying back customers. An FCA investigation found between 2008 and 2010 Wonga sent threatening letters to customers in arrears from non-existent law firms. At one point the firm was charging an annual percentage interest rate of up to 5,853%. But it is on the brink of collapse, despite raising \u0026pound10million from shareholders in a bid to stay afloat. Labour’s Stella Creasy, who has led a campaign against payday lenders, said: “Wonga’s demise shows these businesses were built on exploiting cash-strapped Brits and why \u0026shyregulation was needed to protect them.” Vincent Vernon of Pay Day Refunds has said it is handling 32,000 customer claims, a quarter of them from Wonga. He added: “There could be in excess of a million customers who have suffered from \u0026shyirresponsible lending and are owed money. Three of the poorest- responding lenders are Wonga, Curo and Quick Quid. They are continuing to ignore UK consumer rights. They’re fast to lend and extremely slow to repay.”  Labour MP Meg Hillier added: “There will not be many tears shed if Wonga goes.” The FCA cap on interest rates sparked a decline in the fortunes of the once profitable business which employs 500 staff. In 2015 its losses more than doubled to \u0026pound80.2million and it made a loss of \u0026pound65million the following year. Wonga is reported to have been in talks with the FCA to discuss the company’s options and could appoint Grant Thornton as administrators. If it goes bust, customers owed cash will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FCA refused to comment.  The lender said: “Wonga recently raised \u0026pound10million from shareholders to address the \u0026shysignificant increase in legacy loan complaints. The number of complaints related to loans taken out before the current management team joined in 2014 has accelerated. “The Wonga Board continues to assess all options regarding the future of the Group and its entities.” Wonga was founded in 2006 by South African businessman Errol Damelin. Its adverts feature “cuddly” puppets of elderly people. It once sponsored Newcastle United shirts. Britain’s biggest payday lender, in 2012 it made four million loans to more than one million customers. Good riddance, says friend of \u0027victim\u0027  By Matthew Young  The best pal of a teenager who killed himself when Wonga emptied his bank account has welcomed news the payday loan firm is likely to go out of business. Kane Sparham-Price, 18, was left penniless when the firm withdrew cash in 2013 under a lawful debt agreement. He took his own life that day. Speaking to the Mirror tonight, pal Stefan Williams, 23, said: “Thank God it’s looking like it will go bust.

Snoozing in their bedroom lies Chitty, the first dog the pair ever adopted when they arrived in the country 10 years ago, and Polly, a feisty pup with just one eye.   Chitty and Polly soon join the couple’s other 96 dogs in the garden for breakfast. Some of the disabled ones need feeding individually to make sure they eat properly, and then there’s Joey, the Doberman, who is the couple’s biggest dog and requires one extra meal per day. After brekkie it’s nap time.  \u0027It’s so humid, the dogs spend most of the day snoozing in the shade, says Mary.   While this might not sound like everybody’s cup of tea, Mary couldn’t be happier.  Steve and I met in a pub when I was 26. I beat him in a game of pool and we clicked, explains Mary.  We built a life together. I worked in HR, Steve, now 59, was in manufacturing. We owned our own home in Bradford. We weren’t stinking rich, but 10 years ago we were comfortable enough to take a risk. We decided to go for early retirement and explore the world while we were still young enough to enjoy it.  A friend suggested they start their adventure in Kerala, India, home of palm tree-lined beaches overlooking the Arabian Sea. The pair rented out their home, sold most of their belongings on eBay and gave everything else to friends, family and charity shops. Then, in March 2008, they bought a two-week package holiday and jetted off.  While there we volunteered at an animal sanctuary and we fell in love with Chitty and Legsy, two puppies that had been found on the street. says Mary.  They’d wait for us to arrive each day and we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave them. The big move  So instead of leaving Kerala after the two weeks, Mary and Steve made the huge decision to stay put, checking out of their hotel and renting acommodation so they could take Chitty and Legsy home with them.  In those first few weeks we realised Kerala had a big problem with street dogs, explains Mary.   People here don’t treat dogs with the same affection we do. It’s not uncommon to throw stones at them. One of our dogs, Podge, came to us after her previous owner tied her back legs with wire, simply because she used to gnaw furniture. Shocked by what they saw, Mary and Steve started feeding the street dogs, and they hired a rickshaw with a driver to carry the food. The driver, Kukku, would slam on the brakes and dive into bushes, returning with a stricken dog he’d spotted.  We were kindred spirits, smiles Mary. In the dog house After four years, the dog lovers had adopted so many street dogs that they now shared their home with 40 rescues, and they decided to upsize.  Our new house is actually smaller, but the outdoor area is five times bigger, which means we could help more dogs, says Mary.  I never wanted kids, which baffled the locals. They thought there must be something wrong with me and asked if I’d been to hospital! It was soon after this that Mary and Steve set up a rescue centre called Street Dog Watch, and asked Kukku, their driver, to be clinic manager.  We realised we couldn’t keep taking in dogs without trying to get to the root of the problem, says Mary.  While it’s illegal to kill strays in Kerala, the fine is 50 rupees, which equates to 50p.  It’s not enforced anyway, says Mary. Before every tourist season, a barbaric culling programme would begin, with dead  dogs all over the streets. Locals put out poison too.   So Mary introduced the Animal Birth Control  programme, spaying and neutering street dogs, and giving them an anti-rabies vaccination.  PETA  calculates that by sterilising 2,000 dogs, the ABC programme could have prevented the birth of over 60 million street dogs over the years.  The figure is staggering. It’s better that 60 million dogs never lived, than lived a life of suffering, says Mary. Four years ago, the couple sold their UK home to help fund their projects.  We’ve spent over \u0026pound300,000 of our own money, but it still doesn’t cover all our costs. Lots of animal lovers, both locally and in the UK, sponsor dogs or donate money. It costs \u0026pound15 to sterilise a street dog and \u0026pound25 to feed our dogs each day. All of Mary’s dogs are either injured street dogs or puppies found abandoned. They all have names too. Joey doesn’t like going outside, Podge is lazy, and Iolo was thrown over the clinic wall in a plastic bag. While he’s one of the smallest dogs, he’s also the most confident. Saving lives  Street Dog Watch continues to rescue, feed, vaccinate and sterilise. Healthy dogs are returned to the street or adopted, although locals only adopt males, thought to be better guard dogs.  Mary says, We have 89 females. Our five males can’t guard for toffee! They hide behind our legs.   People abroad often want to adopt the dogs, but Mary doesn’t recommend this.  It’s traumatic for a dog to travel a great distance and can cost \u0026pound5,000, she explains.  I encourage Brits to sponsor or donate towards our vaccination and feeding programmes instead. Better to adopt a dog already in the UK – there are plenty in need.  Mary is also in talks with the local government to agree funding for the ABC and anti-rabies programme. She has met with local authorities to dissuade them from a plan to build a cage in the forest to throw street dogs in.  They hadn’t thought about how they’d feed them, or what they’d do when they started breeding. I convinced them it was a terrible idea, explains Mary.  Mary and Steve’s retirement pot is dwindling, but the couple are happy to live frugally.  Our crockery is cracked and I rely on hand-me-downs from friends. I wear dresses until I wear them out then shred and plait them into dog toys. Old clothes also make great bedding and bandages, says Mary.  We don’t go out much – you can’t when you have 98 dogs! I don’t like to spend on myself when I know how much further money can go for the dogs.

But when I started crawling, huge blisters popped up all over my body from the friction of the floor on my skin.  My parents, both nurses, took me to the doctor right away, and after many tests I was diagnosed with a rare genetic skin condition called Epidermolysis Bullosa , which affects only half a million people worldwide.  Put simply, my skin lacks the protein that binds the layers together, and it blisters and tears at the slightest touch. You can imagine how tough this was as a child – I wanted to run about and climb trees, but in order to do the ordinary things that kids do, I had to wear thick padding all over my arms and legs.  For the most part the other kids were pretty accepting when I was little – it was as a teenager that life became challenging. Girls often struggle with self-esteem at that age anyway, but I was sure that no one would ever find me attractive because of my skin. I picked clothes that covered me up and I’d hide in the loo to change for PE. I remember being in a class once, chatting away with my scarred and blistered hands on display. A boy came wandering over, took one look at me and said, ‘Urgh, look at her hands!’ I was mortified and rushed home in floods of tears. That day stuck with me for years. Managing my skin  My daily routine has always been focused around my skin, which requires a lot of care. Every morning, I remove my bandages and run a bath with sea salt and baby bottle steriliser in it. I soak for about 20 minutes, then I shower with a special soap, dry myself carefully, and set up everything I need for the next, time-consuming stage.  With a small needle, I drain the blood blisters on my legs, before applying an antiseptic gel to any open wounds. Next, I apply cream to the patches of healthy skin, before bandaging up my entire legs and sticking large plasters over my bum and lower back. Because my legs are so long, I need lots of rolls of bandages.   EB affects me internally too. I have a narrowing of my oesophagus so I’m prone to choking on food and I get blisters in my throat.  Every four years I have an operation to widen my oesophagus – I’ve had it done three times, under general aesthetic. People with my condition also have a considerable chance of developing skin cancer by 35, and this is something I’m coming to terms with.  My model life  Because I’ve always been tall – I’m 5ft 11 – and skinny, I was often scouted by modelling agencies, but as a young teen I brushed their offers aside: there was no way I was confident enough to display my skin. After all, if I was too embarrassed to even tell my friends about my condition, how could I show my flesh on a catwalk or for a camera?   But at 17, I was tired of secrets and started to tell my friends about my EB. It was such a relief when I opened up – they were so understanding and were interested, because for years they’d never wanted to ask about my skin but they knew I didn’t want to talk.   Telling my friends felt like a weight lifted from my shoulders, and gave me the confidence boost I needed to try my hand at modelling. My first shoot was terrifying, but now I enjoy it – I’ve done campaign shoots with prestigious photographers and big brands like Misguided. In the early days, I’d make a feature of my skin in shoots, but I’m trying to stay away from that now because I want the message to be that your skin doesn’t define you as a person.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier  is \u0026pound75  and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond Ardlui, Loch Ness Borlum, or one of the many along the coast Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland.  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent  which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle  from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389  and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove , which is now \u0026pound8 . But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250  Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav  - priced \u0026pound89.99  comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Kay Longstaff’s partner, Craig Rayment, 43, had his assets frozen by Spanish authorities as they sent him notice of a tax debt, it is reported.  Banks have reportedly been warned not to lend Mr Rayment, who runs a business for Brits in Costa del Sol, any more money because of his allegedly poor credit rating.  Mr Rayment, an electrician, was reportedly given a fortnight to settle his finances. It is unclear whether he has managed to yet or not, according to The Sun .  The news comes recently after it emerged Ms Longstaff, 46, who had claimed she had accidentally fallen off the deck of the Norwegian Star, had actually purposely lunged into the Adriatic Sea, according to investigators.  Ms Longstaff had told Croatian TV in the aftermath of the ordeal last Saturday night that she had fallen accidentally and her yoga had given her the skills to resist as she waited for rescue teams to fish her out. But according to Italian and Croatian authorities, the woman voluntarily went overboard as she did so in a determined fashion. However, what caused her to jump remains unknown. CCTV images show the air hostess was alone when she went overboard at 11.45pm on August 18. Mr Rayment was reportedly in bed when the incident unfolded and did not report her missing until 2am.

Birmingham Live reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset. The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a family\u0027s occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horrified dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be \u0027human faeces\u0027 smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  3.30pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. 3.55pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. 4pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from 4pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  4.25pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me \u0027babes\u0027 and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how I\u0027ll have to put at least \u0026pound5 of electricity into the meter on top of the \u0026pound139 I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wifi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the week\u0027s schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, different Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  4.40pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isn\u0027t the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  4.45pm - \u0027Sick\u0027 on the steps I\u0027m first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someone\u0027s vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  4.46pm - Horrifying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horrified but despite everything I\u0027ve heard about Pontins, I thought surely this can\u0027t be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number 60. And double checked my documents - number 60.  4.48pm - Spare key to somebody\u0027s apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  4.54pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number 60 have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in? Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. 5pm - Room mix-up not \u0027uncommon\u0027 When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasn\u0027t updated that they\u0027ve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesn\u0027t happen too often. It\u0027s just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldn\u0027t have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. 5.10pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no 61, and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and there\u0027s dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though I\u0027m unsure what these are.  5.31pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. There\u0027s no way to turn it off and fifteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. 5.45pm - Furious guest says \u0027never again\u0027 Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other people\u0027s food still in the fridge. 6pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs \u0026pound5 for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy 80s music plays in the background. 6.30pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an \u0027inflatable zone\u0027 consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an \u0027urban gym\u0027, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  7pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  7.20pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is \u0026pound8.95 and consists of some salad, grated cheese, \u0027vegetable pie\u0027, cod fish cake and chips. There\u0027s also some sliced potato with \u0027mince-meat\u0027 underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. There\u0027s food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as 100% juice.  7.35pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything else on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  8pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like ious animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  8.30pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. 9pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as \u0027party time with Chuckles\u0027 ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. 9.15pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the \u0027I wanna rock\u0027 show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  9.35pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. 9.45pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. 10.30pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  11pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. I\u0027ve brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. 3am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually returned to their rooms. 4.10am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as I\u0027m woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. 8.45am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  10.15am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around 50 families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesn\u0027t understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, it\u0027s stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no lifeguards being present at the pool. 10.30am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of 120 people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  11.30am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  11.45am - \u0027Faeces\u0027 smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of \u0026pound8. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardiff, claim they waited from 4pm until 11pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says 99.9 per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  12pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lifted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. 1pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall there\u0027s plenty for the children to do, entertainment\u0027s fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. We\u0027ve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. 2pm - Same activities, different day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterday\u0027s daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

Dozens of guests turned out to watch Elaine Lyons\u0027 pet Coco receive the word of God, bring gifts for the special occassion. The three-year-old Pugalier has been a close friend to Elaine, 57, since the sudden death of her husband, Wales Online reports. She said she initially came up with the idea as a bit of a joke.  But, a few weeks later, friends and family gathered around the dog as an officiator poured holy water from a plastic bottle in the shape of the Virgin Mary.  Elaine, from Merthyr Tydfil, said: “I never thought I would be like this.  “My neighbours always buy her things and bother with her. They come over with dog treats and look after her, so one day I just said ‘why don’t you become Coco’s godparents?’  “It started off as a bit of a joke but here we are.” Dressed in a pink tutu, Coco seemed content with everything going on around her, as a splash of water was poured over her head while guests stood around watching. Well-wishers applauded and later lined up to present their gifts to Coco and Elaine. The godparents, couple Debbie Smith and Emidio Franca, who live across the road, stood by like any other proud godparents at any other christening.  The ceremony\u0027s acting officiant Karen Meyrick, who has been a friend of Elaine’s for around 23 years, said: “I have never done anything like this in my life – I only just found out today I’d be doing this!” Despite the obvious amount of love for Coco, Elaine admitted that she was previously never bothered about owning a pet. Mum-of-three Elaine, who works at Prince Charles Hospital, said: “My son’s dog had puppies and Coco was the runt of the litter. She was so little she could fit in your hand.  “I said to my son, ‘Please can I have her?’ It’s been three years now. “I can’t imagine life without my Cocopops now.” Coco has been a source of comfort for Elaine in recent years following her husband\u0027s death.  Elaine’s husband Colin died suddenly from a heart attack around eight years ago, aged just 46. The couple had been together for 28 years, and married for seven years. Elaine said: “He had a heart attack when he was 38, and then he died suddenly when he was 46. I was left in the house on my own and it was horrible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man given 18 months live","story":"NewsMan given 18 months to live after being told he has testicular cancer in his BRAINWARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES Jordan Payne, 23, was horrified to discover that he had the suprasellar germ brain tumour, where testicular cancer cells grow in the brain\u0027s pituitary glandShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJames SomperHana Carter16:11, 26 AUG 2018Updated20:12, 26 AUG 2018NewsJordan has been given just 18 months to live after doctors discovered the tumour in his brain \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA builder has been given just under two years to live after developing testicular cancer in his brain. Jordan Payne, 23, was horrified to discover that he had the suprasellar germ brain tumour, where testicular cancer cells grow in the brain\u0027s pituitary gland. The piling operative from Ripley, Derbyshire, was hit by rubble after a pipe he was working on ruptured. His helmet was struck by a piece of debris but he walked away unscalthed. But little did he know that this was the beginning of the growth of the cancerous mass the size of a golf ball that was growing under his skull.  Shortly after the incident on site, his girlfriend at the time began to notice dramatic changes in Jordan\u0027s personality. He began to forget peoples names and appeared lethargic, - prompting his family to encourage him to have a CT scan. After the scan in March 2017, Jordan and his family were given the devastating news of the cancerous mass, which doctors say is the size of a golf ball on his pituitary gland. Jordan\u0027s mum Ellen Payne, 40, said: In the womb the last thing to form are the testicles The seeds to form the testicles travel from the brain to the spine and genitals. In Jordan\u0027s case, not all of the seeds travelled from the brain and remained for years, eventually becoming cancerous. When doctors told us they\u0027d found the tumour, it was just pure shock.  It was the worst day of my life. If he hadn\u0027t have had the accident at work we wouldn\u0027t have found the brain tumour. But it\u0027s just been horrific. It\u0027s changed me, and it\u0027s burned a whole in all our hearts. It\u0027s absolutely devastated us, and we don\u0027t have a choice, we just have to face what\u0027s coming. He\u0027s changed a lot since the accident due to the side effects of the medicine and he\u0027s a lot quieter than he used to be. But he\u0027s still got his amazing sense of humour. I still treat him the same which is how he wants it. Jordan\u0027s scan showed his brain had swelled up, almost covering the whole surface area of his skull. He now also suffers from short term memory loss and epilepsy and is unable to remember most of his ordeal apart from a few fragments.

Now, 100 days on from that spectacular big day, Prince Harry and wife Meghan are embarking on the next stage of their lives together. Monday marks not only a significant milestone but also the countdown to an autumn packed with new engagements and their first major international tour. Dickie Arbiter, former spokesman for the Queen, says: “I think Meghan has been on a tremendous learning curve.” But he added: “It’s another thing entirely getting to grips with everything involved with royal duty.” In three months the couple have celebrated a series of firsts, as the new Duchess of Sussex adapts to life in the global spotlight. She has been welcomed and celebrated by everyone she has met, keen for her to succeed as the latest addition to a family known as The Firm.  However her first steps have been marred by constant insults and abuse from her side of the family, leading to the saga dubbed The Markle Debacle. Meghan, 37, has chosen to remain silent since the very public fallout with her father Thomas Markle. He and the ex-Suits actress have not spoken since her May 19 wedding, after he staged pictures with a paparazzo, for which he was allegedly paid a large fee. He then apparently had a heart attack and pulled out of the wedding, leading to Prince Charles walking Meghan down the aisle and her mum being the only representative of her family by her side.  Since then Meghan, who had wanted to “hit the ground running” with her royal duties, has been a huge success – by Harry’s side at Trooping the Colour, Prince Charles’ birthday celebrations and a mini-tour of Dublin. She wowed crowds with the Queen at her first official joint outing with the monarch, 92. Observers noted fantastic chemistry between them as Her Majesty was pictured laughing and joking with the Duchess. Mr Arbiter adds: “With the Duchess of Sussex being from the US the concept of monarchy is a bit alien, so it’s been a great learning curve she has taken in her stride and managed incredibly well.  “The prime example was when she went to Cheshire with the Queen. “There seemed to be a tremendous rapport between them, a lot of laughter and that would give a clear indication that the Queen is very relaxed in her company and she became relaxed in the Queen’s company. “She and Harry have shown they are getting on incredibly well and always look so fantastically in \u0026shylove. “With experience will come confidence and in the next few months I have no doubt we will see her come out of her shell even more and start to be more vocal for causes and charities she wishes to support.”The two-and-a-half-week autumn tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand will be a huge test for Meghan but royal sources say that she has been “preparing for months”.  The couple will open the Invictus Games in Sydney on October 20, the event Harry devised in 2014 for injured service personnel. Mr Arbiter calls the tour “the litmus test”. He says: “She’s had a taste of the Invictus Games in Toronto last year but she was Harry’s girlfriend. Now she is his wife there will be much more expectation. “She’s a good communicator, she’s good at talking to people but it will be a real baptism of fire. They will have a very demanding schedule and the Duchess will have to get used to local customs with the eyes of the world on her. But no doubt she will come through with flying colours and they will show they will be a force of good for the Commonwealth and the Royal Family on the global stage.” Before then the couple have several public engagements. Next week they are at a gala West End performance of the musical Hamilton in support of Sentebale, Harry’s charity for young people affected by HIV in Africa.  They then attend the WellChild Awards in London on September 4, and 100 Days To Peace, a music event on September 6 marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. It is thought they will first spend time in Balmoral with the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the start of the Highland Games. Joe Little of Majesty magazine, said: “Everything Meghan is experiencing over the last 100 days and indeed for the first year will be for the first time. “Once she gets to grips with how the royal calendar works she will be more relaxed, but already we’ve seen her take to royal duty very well.

Rachael Kin, 28, was hospitalised for six weeks and had her large bowel removed after contracting ulcerative colitis - an inflammation of the colon. She felt that after the surgery she was judged for her appearance and began to feel isolated, so decided to challenge herself and take part in a beauty contest and be a role model for others with the same condition. Those feelings changed for her when she was announced the winner of the regional contest, and now she prepares to compete in the national leg of the competition. The funeral care worker said: I want to be the first contestant with a colostomy and hope to inspire anybody struggling with body confidence issues.  If I can help to prevent one person from going through what I did mentally then that for me is the real crown. Rachael, from High Wycombe, Bucks, was training for the London Marathon when she was rushed to hospital in July last year, leaving her nine-year-old daughter Maja in the care of her family. She said: I went from being fiercely independent to totally vulnerable. I couldn\u0027t walk unaided, couldn\u0027t brush my teeth, or have a shower independently. The IV steroids made my body unrecognisable and I lost all confidence. The former lingerie model said she didn\u0027t know anyone her own age who had an ileostomy, where a hole in the stomach is made to divert waste from the intestine into a special bag. Racheal said: I\u0027d lie awake at night questioning myself. Could I wear the same clothes, could I eat the same food, could I swim in a bikini, would I ever model again? The mother-of-one, who volunteers for a food bank charity, said she experienced discrimination, including from an acupuncturist who refused to treat her because it wasn\u0027t hygienic.  She added: My partner of four years struggled to accept what had happened, and discouraged me from embracing the change, seeing my ileostomy as something that should be kept private. It was heartbreaking to watch my relationship come to an end. My mental health deteriorated rapidly, and from a once confident young woman, I found myself hiding away from the world outside.

The Vatican estimated that 300,000 pilgrims braved the rain for the religious event at the World Meeting of Families closing mass. Pope Francis was driven in a Popemobile as well-wishers waved flags, cheered and reached out to touch the pontiff. After the event the Pope met with Irish bishops before he was met by Minister for Defence and Leader of Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Airport ahead of his departure back to Rome. Many visitors at Phoenix Park said despite the weather and the long walk they wanted to show young people that faith is strong in Ireland, and to set an example for younger generations.   Pope shares feelings of pain and shame at failure of church authorities to tackle clerical abuse in Ireland  Led by a 3,000 strong choir, the crowds joined in song after the Pope completed his lengthy journey through the congregation. All focus then turned to an altar below a huge white Papal Cross, as the pontiff - wearing a specially designed green vestment - began conducting religious proceedings. Addressing the crowd, the Pope referred to his meeting with eight survivors on Saturday evening and said he wanted to take up what they had said to him and seek forgiveness. He listed a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by church figures, including industrial laundries and clerical cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness.  The crowd applauded each time. We ask forgiveness for the abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, of conscience, and sexual abuses perpetrated by members with roles of responsibility in the church, he said. In a special way, we ask pardon for all the abuses committed in ious types of institutions run by males or female religious and by other members of the church, and we ask for forgiveness for those cases of manual work that so many young women and men were subjected to. We ask forgiveness. The Pope continued: We ask forgiveness for the times that, as a church, we did not show the survivors of whatever kind of abuse the compassion and the seeking of justice and truth through concrete actions. We ask for forgiveness.  He gave his speech after the first day of his historic visit to Ireland was dominated by the bitter legacy of historical scandals linked to church abuse and mistreatment. While the Pope conducted his service, Belfast singer Brian Kennedy performed the John Lennon classic Imagine at the Stand for Truth rally in Dublin. Before a crowd of thousands, Kennedy revealed he had written a new verse for the song - which he said he was singing in the direction of the Phoenix Park. The new verse began: Imagine there\u0027s no paedophiles, I wonder if you can. No need to rape or vilify, all of these thousands can. A large crowd had also gathered for a silent vigil in Co Galway, organised by a Manchester woman whose sister vanished from a mother and baby home, is taking place in Tuam. More than 100 people assembled at the Town Hall and planned to walk the 30-minute route to the former site of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home. The Say Nope To The Pope campaign, which includes survivors of clerical abuse, also gave emotional accounts of their lives.  Youth worker Orlagh McGlade travelled to the papal mass from South Armagh along with friends, both religious and secular. I was struck by the amount of young people who are here, it\u0027s great to see, the 23-year-old said. It\u0027s just unreal to see everyone coming together, and sometimes you think the faith in Ireland has been lost but when you see everyone here today its clear the faith is still alive and well. The Mass was the concluding showpiece of the World Meeting of Families  - a church-run event focused on promoting family values. Following the event he left for a meeting with Irish bishops ahead of his flight back to Rome a little later. During his meeting with the Bishops, the Pope noted that the scandals had also caused hurt and discouragement to current members of the priesthood. The Pope said that was often ignored or underestimated. He said: A recurrent theme of my visit, of course, has been the Church\u0027s need to acknowledge and remedy, with evangelical honesty and courage, past failures with regard to the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  He said the bishops had resolutely moved forward with steps to better safeguard children within the Church. In these years, all of us have had our eyes opened to the gravity and extent of sexual abuse in ious social settings, he added. In Ireland, as elsewhere, the honesty and integrity with which the Church chooses to confront this painful chapter of her history can offer an example and a warning to society as a whole. Earlier Pope Francis prayed for victims of abuse left scarred by painful memories during a visit to the holy Knock Shrine. During his speech he said no-one could be failed to be moved by stories of young abuse victims who were robbed of their innocence. The pontiff added: This open wound challenges us to be firm and decisive in the pursuit of truth and justice. I beg the Lord\u0027s forgiveness for these sins and for the scandal and betrayal felt by so many others in God\u0027s family.  I ask our Blessed Mother to intercede for the healing of the survivors and to confirm every member of our Christian family in the resolve never again to permit these situations to occur. Thousands of supporters waved flags for the Pope as he arrived at the famous shrine in Co Mayo on the second day of his Ireland visit. Well wishers cheered for him in his Popemobile as he toured through crowds of pilgrims gathered in the torrential rain. Pope Francis then entered the chapel at the shrine site for a period of silent prayer before addressing the crowds. Pope Francis yesterday used the Spanish word caca, which translates as excrement, to describe those who covered up for clerics who abused people in their care.  His comments came during his private meeting with eight people representing a wide section of those who were mistreated by members of the Catholic Church in Ireland. By visiting the Knock Shrine today, Pope Francis is following in the footsteps of his predecessor John Paul II, who arrived at the hallowed spot in Co Mayo in 1979. In August 1879, 15 people said they saw an apparition in Knock of the Virgin Mary, St Joseph, St John the Evangelist and a lamb. Around 1.5 million people now visit the site every year.  The Pope landed at Knock airport at about 9.30am ahead of his visit to the holy shrine. Four local schools greeted the pontiff in the heavy rain and around 100 schoolchildren from Co Mayo were waiting for him. They waved Vatican and Mayo flags. Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine, said: People started to come here in the hope of receiving cures, and Knock became synonymous for that. And people came to the spot of the apparition to get some clay or holy water to send to abroad.

They then enjoyed a lunch with other members of the royal family including the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Edward, Sophie the Countess of Wessex and their children, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn. The Princess Royal as well as Zara and Mike Tindall were also understood to be present for the gathering on Friday.  Reports said the Queen , 92, drove herself there in her Range Rover.

John and Susan Cooper died suddenly within four hours of each other while on a Thomas Cook holiday at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada.  Food, water and air conditioning are being probed as authorities try to establish the cause of their deaths amid accusations from the Burnley couple\u0027s daughter Kelly that something suspicious had happened. Now holidaymakers Paul and Bev Vanstone have claimed they also became ill while staying at the same hotel.  The pair were staying at the resort with their two children and Mr Vanstone\u0027s mother when four of them came down with stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. Mr Vanstone, 41, has revealed photos showing raw, pink chicken he claims he was served at the hotel.  He said: There was a party of six of us that went. My wife was treated for gastroenteritis, my 14-year-old daughter went down with a vomiting and diarrhoea bug and two days before leaving I had really bad stomach cramps and diarrhoea. While we were there we had to complain because we were served raw chicken. I ate that but if that had been my daughter... it was raw - very, very raw.  The dad-of-two said he arrived home in Oxford on August 6 and went to the doctor where he was diagnosed with high levels of salmonella poisoning.   He later lodged a complaint with Thomas Cook, but said the doctor was unable to confirm exactly what made them all ill. Mr Vanstone added: It could be chicken, it could have been the water, it could have been anything that you can get salmonella from.  Thomas Cook said that the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Cooper\u0027s deaths were still unclear and there could be a wait of 10 days for tests to show the cause .

There were many parts which saw a decent amount of rain with the south west of England getting 30 millimetres while the the south east had 10 millimetres. Heavy rain on Sunday also forced the cancellation of the Silverstone GoPro British Grand Prix MotoGP. Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle made a personal apology, in an online post, after race fans were subjected to the most extraordinarily long wait in the foulest of British weather conditions which ultimately resulted in no race at all.   He said that a hoped for break in the weather did not arrive and the riders decided not to race as the conditions were not going to be right to race.  Revellers were also soaked at the Notting Hill Carnival in London. Top temperatures may be 21C  in the south east on Monday and all in all, it is going to be better than Sunday.  Mr Snell said: It is not going to be a completely dry day. There is still going to to a scattering of showers across the northern and central parts of the UK but it will be a vast improvement. Meteorologist Helen Roberts said Monday is looking like a much better day in comparison, with temperatures expected to reach the high teens and low 20s for many.  She added: Certainly the feel of things will be much better, it will certainly feel warmer. There will be a fair amount of cloud around but with bright spells as well.

Victoria Andrews, 26, was shocked to learn she was pregnant after doctors told her she was infertile due to Polycystic Oy Syndrome. Yet she gave birth to baby Tobias – Toby for short – in May. And while Victoria has had to sell half of her collection to buy things for her real baby, Toby still has 40 doll brothers and sisters. He even has a ‘twin’ - an identical version of a sleeping newborn Toby. Victoria said: “I couldn’t believe it when I found out I was pregnant. “Obviously I love babies. I just thought I would only ever have the doll iety.  “I was smitten with Toby right away. He’s got my eyes and my ‘bum’ chin. I haven’t even picked up a doll since he was born.” Victoria only learned she was pregnant after going to the doctor after weeks of what she thought was a stomach ulcer or gastroenteritis. She said: “My blood tests came back. The doctor talked to me for a few minutes and then said ‘congratulations by the way, you’re at least seven weeks pregnant.’” The barmaid still didn’t believe it – so she paid for a private scan. “It was only when I saw his tiny body that I started to celebrate,” Victoria said. “I was so happy.” Last year Victoria started taking Infolic - a drug her mum found online that was meant to halt the facial hair growth polycystic oy sufferers often have to deal with.  But it seems the medication also resulted in a spike in the barmaid’s fertility. Victoria said: “I’d tried so many different things in the past that hadn’t worked it didn’t really occur to me that this one might. I wasn’t even taking it for my fertility. “Me and my partner at the time didn’t use protection – there was no need. “We split up before I even knew I was pregnant because I found out he was cheating. “Now he doesn’t want anything to do with the baby. It’s massively his loss – Toby is absolutely amazing.” As a single mum Victoria had to offload some dolls to help make ends meet.  She made nearly \u0026pound10,000 selling about 40 dolls – called ‘reborns’ — and spent the money on a cot, pram and other necessities for Toby. At its peak her collection had over 100 dolls. Although she has always buys and the sells the dolls in order to upgrade to better versions, Victoria reckons she has spent around \u0026pound60,000 on the hobby. Now, with a real baby, she no longer has time to pay attention to the 40 she still has left. Victoria said: “Some of the ladies in the doll community take their collections quite seriously. They with feed and bathe their dolls and put them into pyjamas at night. “I mostly keep mine on a shelf. “Sometimes, before I had Toby, I would pick them up for a cuddle if I was feeling down. It’s really soothing. “But now I’ve got him I don’t need to do that. I don’t have time. I haven’t even picked one up since Toby came along. “I’ve kept my favourites though. Some of the best ones I paid \u0026pound1,500 for.” "},{"url":null,"title":"david katz know far after","story":"NewsDavid Katz: All we know so far after Jacksonville shooter \"snapped\" during video game tournament killing twoWARNING - DISTRESSING VIDEO: Everything we know about Katz, who has been compared to school shooter Adam LanzaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitching10:23, 27 AUG 2018Updated10:32, 27 AUG 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/us-news/video/professional-player-shot-during-live-13144234,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDavid Katz has been named as the disgruntled gunman who killed two people and wounded 11 others in the latest mass shooting in America. The 24-year-old, wearing an army green jacket, killed himself after opening fire at a Madden NFL 19 video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday afternoon. Eyewitnesses say Katz was angry and snapped after being eliminated from the competition, and came back with a handgun seeking revenge. They said Katz - who has been compared to Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza - had been acting weird, wore the same clothes on both days of the event, and refused to shake hands and stared blankly after losing a game on Saturday. Who was David Katz?  Katz, 24, was from Baltimore, Maryland, about 750 miles north of Jacksonville. He was an avid video gamer and was well-known on the pro Madden circuit under nicknames or handles including Bread, mrslicedbread, ravens2012champs and ravenschamp, the latter two being references to the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League . But fellow gamers have said they noticed strange behaviour from him, including a lack of emotion and blank stares. In February 2017 Katz won a Madden 17 championship hosted by the NFL\u0027s Buffalo Bills - a tournament that included one of his victims, Eli Clayton. Katz was given a cheque for 10,000  anda Bills jersey with the name Madden Champ and number 17.  An announcer once said during a game: “You are not gonna see much emotion from our guy Bread. David Katz keeps to himself. He’s a man of business. He’s not here to make friends. To even get him to open up to talk to you about anything, it’s like pulling teeth, man. After winning the Buffalo event, Katz told ex-Bills player Steve Tasker in an interview: I think personally I\u0027m one of the better players. But fellow gamers had accused him of cheating and making online head-to-head games glitchy to gain an advantage. The FBI, ATF and police have been searching Katz\u0027s family\u0027s upscale Baltimore townhouse, and police in Jacksonville have located and seized his car. It is believed he had been staying at a hotel nearby. What happened?  At least a dozen shots rang out at the GLHF Gaming Bar at Chicago Pizza, which was hosting the tournament, at about 1.30pm on Sunday. Terrifying footage from a live stream on the website Twitch shows two young men playing against each other when the shooting starts. A red laser - possibly a laser sight from Katz\u0027s handgun - suddenly appears on one man\u0027s chest as shots are fired. People begin screaming and a man says: Oh f***, what did he shoot me with? At least a dozen shots are heard as terrified gamers ran for their lives or hid amid the chaos.  At some point, Katz fatally shot himself inside the shopping centre as police raced to the scene. His body was found near the bodies of the two who were shot dead. In the aftermath, there is panic and confusion. A man appears to be in shock, repeatedly saying Oh my God, while another man tells a victim to sit down and asks: Where did you get hit? Eyewitnesses said families with babies were inside the venue at the Jacksonville Landing, a downtown marketplace on the St Johns River. Raheem Johnson, a cook at Chicago Pizza, told of the chilling moment he saw the gunman. Mr Johnson told CBS News that he grabbed two kitchen knives in case he had to defend himself, adding: Dude came in there to kill. It was rampage mode. Why did Katz target the tournament?  Eyewitnesses said Katz was angry after losing again on Sunday and being eliminated from the tournament. Fellow gamer Steven Jauski, who ran and hid in a toilet when gunfire erupted, told the Los Angeles Times that the gunman came back and “targeted a few people” before killing himself. Eyewitnesses Rico Martinez and Jais Long told the Tampa Bay Times that the gunman was nerdy and got mad because he lost. He went to his car, got a gun and came back inside and started blasting everybody, the pair said. Marquis Williams told the Tampa Bay Times that Katz was wearing an army green jacket when he shot up the venue. His girlfriend, Taylor Poindexter, said the couple watched the shooter take aim at his victims. She said: We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds. I was scared for my life and my boyfriend\u0027s. A Chicago Pizza worker named Brianna told ABC News that Katz had argued with another gamer and gone to the back of the room, where he waited for a few minutes, before opening fire. Police have declined to comment on the reason for the shooting. Detectives have obtained a video of the incident. Gunman was acting weird, wearing same clothes  Dennis Alston told Action News Jax that he and another gamer who beat Katz during the tournament are both still alive. He said: I felt like he was targeting, but I don\u0027t think it was the people who beat him. It seemed like it was premeditated. Mr Alston said Katz was wearing sunglasses and had been weird all weekend. He added: He didn\u0027t speak to anybody, even after we played, I beat him , I went to shake his hand and tell him good game and he just looked at me. He didn\u0027t say anything. He had on basically the same outfit that he had on the day before. Police said Katz used one gun during his rampage. It was unclear how he had obtained the weapon. Why is he being compared to Adam Lanza?  After Sunday\u0027s shooting, social media users drew comparisons between Katz and Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012. Lanza, a bullied loner who was mentally ill, shot and killed his mum Nancy before the massacre, and took his own life as emergency services responded to the mass shooting. Comparisons between Katz and other mass shooters were made as a profile and photos of the gunman emerged on Sunday. One Twitter user wrote: David Katz, Nicholas Cruz, James Holmes, and Adam Lanza all mass shooters, and have that scary hollow look in their eyes. Another added: David Katz — shooter in the Jacksonville Shooting — eerily looks a lot like Lanza the guy that did Sandy Hook. Who were the victims?  Two young men were killed and 11 other people were injured by gunfire in Jacksonville. A number of people were trampled as gamers and spectators fled in terror. The two men who were shot dead have been named by friends as Elijah  Clayton, 22, and Taylor Robertson, 27. Clayton, of Woodland Hills, California, was known by his Madden names True or Trueboy, and had reportedly won more than 50,000  in prize money. An EA Sports profile reads: Despite a rough season, True remains one of the best around and can potentially win it all when it\u0027s done, "},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant woman bursts tears after","story":"NewsPregnant woman bursts into tears after learning her baby\u0027s gender through recording of dead dad\u0027s voiceJennifer Jones-Prothro, from California, is expecting her ninth child in December with husband James - who used old voicemail clips of the late grandfather\u0027s voice to create the heartwarming messageShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary08:01, 27 AUG 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/video/woman-learns-gender-baby-through-13145328,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pregnant woman learned the gender of her baby through a recording of her dead dad\u0027s voice.

At least 580 people were buried at the site near Lake Turkana, Kenya, making it the earliest and largest one in eastern Africa, archaeologists say.  And experts claim the discovery challenges long-held views about early societies as it was built by an egalitarian group without separate social classes. According to the international research team, the Lothagam North Pillar Site was a communal cemetery constructed and used over a period of several centuries, between about 5,000 and 4,300 years ago. Early herders built a platform around 30 metres in diameter and excavated a large cavity in the centre to bury their dead. After the cavity was filled and capped with stones, the builders placed large, megalith pillars, some sourced from as much as a kilometre away, on top. Stone circles and cairns were added nearby.  Researchers say 580 men, women and children of different ages were buried in the central cavity alongside personal ornaments, with no burials being singled out with special treatment. The existence of such a huge project contradicts long-standing beliefs that a stratified social hierarchy is necessary for the construction of large public buildings or monuments. Historically, archaeologists have theorised people built permanent monuments as reminders of shared history, ideals and culture, when they had established a settled, socially stratified agriculture society with abundant resources and strong leadership. It was believed that a political structure and the resources for specialisation were necessary to engaging in monument building. Ancient monuments have previously been regarded as reliable indicators of complex societies with separate social classes.  Doctor Elizabeth Sawchuk, of Stony Brook University in the US, said: This discovery challenges earlier ideas about monumentality.   Lothagam North provides an example of monumentality that is not demonstrably linked to the emergence of hierarchy, forcing us to consider other narratives of social change. She said the discovery is consistent with similar examples elsewhere in Africa and other continents where large, monumental structures have been built by groups thought to be egalitarian in their social organisation. The research team said the discover has the potential to reshape global perspectives on how and why large groups of people come together to form complex societies. They said it appears that Lothagam North was built during a period of profound change. Pastoralism, or livestock farming, had just been introduced to the Turkana Basin and newcomers arriving with sheep, goats, and cattle would have encountered diverse groups of fisher-hunter-gatherers already living around the lake. Newcomers and locals faced a difficult environmental situation, as annual rainfall decreased during that period and Lake Turkana shrunk by as much as 50 per cent.

It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"free advice dundee youngsters to find out more about

two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"midfielder stanton major dundee united worry for partick

he could be forced to sit out this weekend’s game because of groin trouble and, if that’s the case, there are concerns he could be out for some time.“Sam Stanton has a hernia problem that has come

We have been offering equine-assisted therapy visits to residential homes, nurseries, hospitals and workplaces.“We have seen our service users build their self-esteem and confidence by forming a bond with the ponies.“The size of the ponies means they are much less intimidating and more approachable to children and the elderly or those in wheelchairs.“Our ponies are specially trained and have everlasting patience which appeals to those who struggle with social interaction.“For children and adults suffering social and emotional issues, working with the ponies builds confidence which they can then translate into real life skills.”Jenna said that although the company does not offer rides on the ponies, there are plenty of physical benefits in simply stroking the animals.She said: “Children with poor motor skills can work on their muscles and improve cognitive skills and general fitness by grooming and working with the ponies.“We offer our services to anyone who thinks they would benefit from equine therapy, including children and young people as well as the disabled and elderly.”Rebecca said that 11-year-old Bella had worked as a therapy pony before.“She has impeccable manners and knows exactly how to make people smile,” she said.“Rosie is three and will stand all day for cuddles and kisses and Carly at one is youngest of the group and is learning from the others.“No matter what mood people are in Carly makes them laugh.”Rebecca added: “When our ponies visit they can enter buildings, travel up to the top floors in the lift and even visit patients in their rooms.“They wear special shoes so they won’t mess floors – and we have the other end covered with special bags attached to catch any unexpected surprises.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"with former celtic man tony watt in form st johnstone have goals in them ahead of dundee clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith Tony Watt leading the way, St Johnstone look like they have goals in them this season.The former Celtic front man has netted five times and, with David McMillan, Chris Kane, Greg Hurst and Callum Hendry also all well capable of goals, the Perth side certainly have no shortage of striking options for their game at home to Dundee on Saturday.They also have a goal threat on the wings as Drey Wright and Matty Kennedy have already found the net this season.However, the top end of the park is not the only scoring threat Saints have according to their former defender Raymond Stewart.Raymond finished his playing career at McDiarmid Park after an illustrious campaign with Dundee United, West Ham and Scotland and he believes the Perth team’s full-backs, Richard Foster and Scott Tanser, offer a threat to Dundee.Raymond was no stranger himself to scoring from his right and left-back berths although most of his counters were from penalties.Raymond, voted 17th best all-time West Ham player in a fans’ poll, as well as being named in the best-ever West Ham XI, said: “Foster and Tanser are important players in the St Johnstone team as they both have good engines, they get up and down, and their delivery is good from open play and set pieces.“They are both a threat going forward and are capable of scoring goals as well as making them.“Foster already has assists to his name this season.“He is a good all-round pro who never shirks tackles.

A strong penalty claim was waved away by referee Andrew Dallas.Moments later Daryl Horgan sammed a shot into the side netting.On the quarter hour mark keeper Lewis produced a superb save when Horgan raced onto a through ball from Lewis Stevenson and unleashed a vicious shot.Lewis instinctively pushed stuck a hand up to push it wide for a corner.Hibs were dominating the early phase and Martin Boyle broke down the right before shooting wide.Aberdeen threatened in the 30th minute when Gary Mackay-Steven delivered a cross from the left deep to the back post.

I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east labour branches call for end of sanctions on aberdeen nine","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree north-east Labour branches have called for the end of the suspension of the “Aberdeen Nine”.At a joint meeting on Saturday, Constituency Labour Parties  from the north-east passed a motion calling for an end to the 18-month suspension of the councillors, who were suspended from Scottish Labour by former leader Kezia Dugdale for making an unauthorised deal, forming a coalition with the Conservatives at Aberdeen City Council .Barry Mitchell, the chairman of Donside CLP, who brought the motion, said: “Aberdeen’s Labour councillors know that their first duty is to the city they were elected to serve, which is why they have worked with others to implement the key promises in Labour’s 2017 manifesto.“They deserve the party’s full support, and I am glad so many members from across the city have come together to back our local councillors.”North-east MSP Lewis Macdonald welcomed the move.Mr Macdonald said: “Local Labour Party members have called for an end to suspension of the Aberdeen Nine, and for threats to expel them from the Labour Party to be dropped.“I will back their call for Labour’s National Constitutional Committee to restore full membership rights to our local councillors, and for a return to grown-up debate and discussion in place of heavy-handed disciplinary action.”The suspension would need to be lifted by the Scottish Labour National Constitutional Committee, which has not set a date for its next meeting.The Scottish Labour Party did not respond to requests for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east service for vulnerable adults gets top marks from inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA support service for vulnerable adults in the north-east has been awarded top marks by inspectors for helping them make friends.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Aberdeenshire Council Shared Lives Scheme’s adult placement programme and rated it “excellent” the best of six possible ratings – a rating rarely given.Based at Viewmount on Arduthie Road, Stonehaven, the service arranges for vulnerable adults to live with families and receive personal care, support or counselling either on a temporary or permanent basis.At the time of the inspection the scheme had 20 sets of carers and 26 service users.The report said: “The service achieved an excellent standard.

We were maybe just choosing the wrong options or whatever. But we’re happy.”Of his scorers, he added: “It was Jordan’s  first goal for us. He had a couple of great strikes, the keeper had a couple of great saves off him.“So it was pleasing to get him off the mark.“For his confidence it’ll do him the world of good.“He’s just getting to know the boys. At a new club it takes time with new players.“The third  wasn’t a bad strike, but I thought the first was a really good move.“It was counter attack where Jordon  played in Blair  and Blair tucked it away really nicely.“That’s his first goal since he came back too. We played him a bit further forward today and he certainly revelled in that role.”The win continued Cove’s perfect start in the Highland League and was their sixth clean sheet in a row, despite resting veterans Eric Watson and Paul McManus as the twice-weekly games continue.Brown thrashed at a chance from 12 yards early doors at the Balmoral Stadium, before Adam Cross just failed to hit a shot inside Stuart McKenzie’s back post for Turriff on 17 minutes.Cove started ramping up the pressure on the visitors, however, with Megginson having a six-yard shot blocked on the line by Ross Anderson, before the prolific scorer saw an effort tipped round the post by Hobday.He rounded the keeper 10 minutes later, but was denied again by a block from the right angle, before Hobday made a point-blank stop from MacRae.The opener came on 41 minutes. Jamie Masson spotted Yule charging through, Turra tried and just failed to step out and Yule was free to slot it past the on-rushing Hobday.Turriff never looked like coming back into it after half-time, and on 71 minutes things were sealed.MacRae forced a block from Hobday at close range before sliding in to smash his second bite at the chance into the bottom-left corner.And on 88 minutes, a frustrated Megginson, teed up by Scully, leathered it in the top-left corner from the edge of the area.Turra boss Hunter, who thought the first goal was offside but conceded he sees Cove as Highland champions again this year, said: “We did all right for a young team, but their quality showed.“The players acquitted themselves well, for their first time on a big park, they had a couple of half chances.“I’m more disappointed the belief went in the second-half with our players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"peterhead boss hails big victory at albion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeterhead boss Jim McInally declared his side’s win over Stirling Albion “a big victory”.The Blue Toon stayed joint top of League Two with the 2-0 success at Forthbank.McInally’s men are still unbeaten and exorcised a disappointing defeat to Stirling in the League Cup at Balmoor last month.Stirling, expected to challenge for the title, are pointless so far.McInally said “It was a good win.“We could have played better, but we got a good victory against a team who are obviously down on their luck a wee bit.“It’s only a matter of time before they start winning games, so it was a big victory.”He described it as a “revenge mission” beforehand, and thinks the result of the previous match this term helped his team.He said: “The guys always are up for it.“We just tried to learn a lesson from the last game, be a wee bit tighter with balls up to  Peter MacDonald and stuff like that.“They dealt with that fine, but I think in general we started the game really well.“In the middle part they came into it and could have scored a couple.“When we scored, we never really looked back and saw the game out really well.“We should have probably scored another two goals.”Despite another three points and his side remaining at the summit of the League Two table as they chase promotion, McInally said it’s too early to think they’ve reached top form.He added: “You could think that, but then you look at next week’s fixture and we’re playing the team running beside us, Edinburgh City .“We just need to go into another big game.“Saturday was good for us.“We started as well as we have done, but we’ve still got a bit to go.“We need to improve even more.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around 79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"junior championship at lochgilphead golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 6:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe juniors took to the course last Thursday and Friday August 9 and 10 to compete for the coveted title of Junior Champion for 2018.Day one saw Ruan McKellar finish with a fantastic gross 92, giving him an eight shot lead over his brother Kern.

The work they have put in over last year has been admirable and  we hope we have given Mid Argyll a band to be proud of.\u0026#8217Pipe Major Stuart Liddell of Inveraray and District was pleased with his band\u0026#8217s result, commenting: \u0026#8216It has been another fantastic season for the band \u0026#8211 having been second in four of the five championships, winning the Europeans in Forres and securing the Champion of Champions for the third consecutive year.\u0026#8216The competition this year has been of a very high level and has been interesting to see four different bands lift titles \u0026#8211 Scottish Power , St Lawrence O\u0026#8217Toole from Ireland , ourselves  and Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026#8211 who have just been crowned the world champions for the 12th time under Pipe Major Richard Parkes, equalling the record set by the legendary Pipe Major Ian McLellan of Strathclyde Police.\u0026#8216It is great to be included amongst these great bands and the consistency is reflective of all the hard work that goes into it.\u0026#8217Elsewhere, in Novice A, Oban High School came second behind Dollar Academy.Kintyre Schools came an excellent fifth in a Novice B competition featuring 19 bands from across the globe.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth shinty takes macaulay centre stage","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/08/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPrior to the senior shinty Macaulay Cup Final on Saturday August 18, three Argyll and Bute district teams contested a round-robin tournament at the nearby rugby club.The tournament featured S1 teams representing Oban/Ballachulish, Mid Argyll and Cowal and Bute.Mid Argyll were up first against the Oban area team.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out . It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7  are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-dad-delivers-baby-in-familys-sitting-room","story":"A RAIL worker from the Borders delivered his baby daughter in the family\u0026rsquos sitting room.\nGarry Kennan from Coldstream was guided through the birth by a Scottish Ambulance Service call taker.\nMum Vanessa was 40 weeks pregnant and a home birth had been scheduled for the new arrival.\nAs signs showed the birth was imminent on Tuesday, July 30 the couple\u0026rsquos other kids, Callum, 10, Charlotte, nine, and Caitlyn, five were dropped off at a relative\u0026rsquos house.\nAnd they were waiting anxiously for a midwife to arrive when baby Faith decided to make an appearance.\nGarry, a conductor team manager for ScotRail, today praised the Scottish Ambulance Service.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThings progressed very quickly and she went into labour before any healthcare professionals arrived.\n\u0026ldquoI was told by Borders General Hospital that a midwife was on the way.\nThe emergency call from Garry was made at 3.42pm, taken by Marianne McKeown.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe call taker I spoke to was fantastic.\n\"She kept me calm when I was darting about like a headless chicken and talked me through everything.

\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade

lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in abundance for boating

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"range-of-options-for-gp-surgery-in-haddington-considered","story":"  More than 1,000 houses are being built on the town\u0026rsquos western edge, with Haddington\u0026rsquos population expected to increase substantially in the coming years.  That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the iety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.

Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening.

Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

Along with humans, killer whales and short-finned pilot whales were the only others previously known to experience the menopause.  Most species in the wild continue reproducing until they die.  The study, published in journal Scientific Reports, used data from the dead whales of 16 species and found dormant oies in older beluga and narwhal females.  These species may have social structures which mean females live among more and more close relatives as they age, the researchers said.  They suggest that menopause has evolved independently in three toothed whale species, with beluga whales and narwhals possibly sharing a common ancestor.  Lead author Dr Sam Ellis, from the University of Exeter, said: \u0026ldquoFor menopause to make sense in evolutionary terms, a species needs both a reason to stop reproducing and a reason to live on afterwards.  \u0026ldquoIn killer whales, the reason to stop comes because both male and female offspring stay with their mothers for life \u0026ndash so as a female ages, her group contains more and more of her children and grandchildren.  \u0026ldquoThis increasing relatedness means that, if she keeps having young, they compete with her own direct descendants for resources such as food.  \u0026ldquoThe reason to continue living is that older females are of great benefit to their offspring and grand-offspring. For example, their knowledge of where to find food helps groups survive.  Research into human ancestors suggests they also lived among more and more relatives as they aged, and may have evolved in a similar way so they could impart their wisdom.  Senior author Professor Darren Croft, from the University of Exeter, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to study human behaviour in the modern world because it\u0026rsquos so far removed from the conditions our ancestors lived in.  \u0026ldquoLooking at other species like these toothed whales can help us establish how this unusual reproductive strategy has evolved.  There has already been extensive research into the existence of the menopause among killer whales.  Detailed observations of live beluga whales and narwhals have not yet been carried out."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7757241.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"alex-salmond-harassment-allegations-nicola-sturgeon-reacts","story":"  The First Minister issued a statement following the revelations the Mr Salmond was the subject of two complaints that were investigated by the Scottish Government.  The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court. The Scottish Government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this focus on process cannot deflect from the fact that complaints were made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  The First minister said here relationship with Mr Salmond, who she has previously described as a mentor, makes it difficult to deal with but that people must feel able to make complaints.

It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.  Mr Salmond denied the allegations and was taking action against the Scottish Government claiming he was denied the opportunity to refute them.

This would, of course, open the way for MSP and former MP Willie Rennie, currently the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, to seek the bigger role.  When Sir Vince succeeded Tim Farron as party leader following the 2017 General Election, there was speculation that he had done so as a caretaker that his deputy Jo Swinson, the 38-year-old MP for East Dunbartonshire - who gave birth to her second child in July - would take over at some stage before the next General Election. This is due on May 5 2022, within four days of which Sir Vince will enter his 80th year.  Asked about the prospect of Sir Vince standing down as leader, a party source said: \"He\u0027s not about to stand down or use the speech to stand down. There are no plans to step down any time soon.\"  It is expected that the Lib Dem leader will at conference unveil proposals to create a registered supporters scheme, similar to the one that allowed 180,000 people to vote in the Labour leadership elections.  Rules will also be rewritten so that supporters will need to be enrolled for at least 12 months before voting, to prevent any infiltration or undue influence by rival parties.  Sources suggested that Sir Vince hoped to emulate the success of Justin Trudeau\u0027s Liberal Party in Canada, which introduced the changes and went from third to first place in its 2015 election victory.  A consultation on the proposed changes is expected to last several months.  The party currently has 12 MPs four of whom are Scots: Ms Swinson Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael, the former Scottish Secretary in the Lib-Con Coalition Christine Jardine, who represents Edinburgh West and Jamie Stone, who is MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.  Some UK parties have had leaders who have not been at Westminster. The highest profile is Nicola Sturgeon, the current SNP leader and First Minister. Natalie Bennett, who was not an MP, led the Green Party between 2012 and 2016. She stood unsuccessfully at the 2015 General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"schools-quango-snubs-pupil-mentor-schemes","story":"  Official guidance on the website of Education Scotland, the country\u0026rsquos national curriculum body, has rated the impact of mentoring - where an adult role model supports a pupil through secondary school - as \u0026ldquozero.  Earlier this year, an evaluation described as \u0026ldquoexceptional a Glasgow-wide mentoring project for pupils with family difficulties.  The success of the MCR Pathways project has already seen it rolled out to Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen and an additional ten councils are signing up.  The Scottish Government also funds a mentoring programme for young people looked after at home called Intandem.  The Intandem website states: \u0026ldquoWe know how crucial it is for young people to have at least one long term relationship with a positive adult role-model.  However, Education Scotland\u0026rsquos guidance for schools on closing the attainment gap states: \u0026ldquoOn average, mentoring appears to have little or no positive impact on academic outcomes.  \u0026ldquoSchool-based mentoring programmes appear to be less effective than community-based approaches, possibly because school-based mentoring can result in fewer opportunities for young people to develop more lasting and trusting relationships with adult role models.  The report says some studies have found positive impacts for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and for non-academic outcomes such as attitudes to school, attendance and behaviour.  But it adds: \u0026ldquoThere are risks associated with unsuccessful mentor pairings, which may have a detrimental effect on the mentee, and some studies report negative overall impacts.  Iain MacRitchie, a Glaswegian businessman who founded MCR Pathways, said different versions of mentoring had ying degrees of effectiveness.  But he added: \u0026ldquoWhilst there is some debate over how much research has been carried out on mentoring, there is no debate on the impact that a caring adult outside of the immediate family unit can have on our most disadvantaged young people.  \u0026ldquoThose in the care system can contend with considerable degrees of instability, uncertainty, distrust and trauma, layered with a lack of control, confidence, hope and self-belief \u0026ndash all through no fault of their own.  \u0026ldquoWhat we have found over 11 years working in the most challenging of city communities and circumstances is that mentoring can have a profound impact.  The MCR Pathways evaluation report found the percentage of care-experienced young people staying on at school beyond S4 who were mentored was 79 per cent, compared to a national average of 36 per cent. The proportion going to college, university or a job was 86 per cent compared to an average of 50 per cent.  The report said: \u0026ldquoThe education outcomes are exceptional when mentored young people\u0026rsquos achievements are compared to national and Glasgow statistics for care-experienced young people.  Mentoring in education involves pairing young people with an older peer or volunteer, who acts as a positive role model.  Mentoring aims to build confidence, develop resilience and character, or raise aspirations, rather than to deliver specific academic skills or knowledge."},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteer-jacob-rees-mogg-criticised-after-suggesting-irish-border-inspections-post-brexit","story":"  Simon Coveney, Ireland\u0026rsquos Deputy Prime Minister, took to social media to say it was hard to believe such a senior British politician could be \u0026ldquoso ill-informed as to make such comments after the Somerset MP\u0026rsquos remarks, filmed during a town hall meeting, were disseminated.  The issue of how to keep frictionless trade across the Irish border has become arguably the biggest stumbling block to getting a deal with Brussels on Brexit.  But Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-hard Brexit European Research Group faction of Conservative MPs, told the town hall meeting that Ireland \"would not be a free-for-all\" and that \"historic arrangements\" could continue.  He explained: \"There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It\u0027s not a border that everyone has to go through every day. But, of course, for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border to try and stop gun-running and things like that.  The Tory backbencher added: \"It\u0026rsquos not inconsistent to have a border that people can pass through but you are keeping an eye on.\"  However, Mr Coveney tweeted: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill-informed about Ireland + the politics of the #Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these. We have left \u0026ldquothe troubles behind us, through the sincere efforts of many, + we intend on keeping it that way.  Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, also hit out at Mr Rees-Mogg, declaring: \"This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland.\"  His Labour colleague David Lammy insisted peace on the island of Ireland could not be allowed to be torn apart by \"hard right ideologues\"."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-the-uncomfortable-truths-weve-learned-from-the-alex-salmond-claims","story":"  As for what the former First Minister actually said at the press conference, we should all be feeling some sympathy for him, as well as a large dose of frustration at what look like inconsistencies. In his official statement, Mr Salmond said he had not been allowed to properly challenge the case against him \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoI have not been allowed to see the evidence, he said. And yet in the same statement he said the complaints were patently ridiculous. So, which is it? How can he say the complaints are ridiculous if he has not seen them? He either knows what the complaints are, or he doesn\u0026rsquot.  Assuming he doesn\u0026rsquot, Mr Salmond is right to object to how the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints process is working. It is one of the basic principles of natural justice that an accused person should know the details of the case against him or her, and who is making it, and yet it would appear Mr Salmond has been given neither of those things.  Increasingly, and sadly, this is how modern complaints procedures work, including it would seem the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos. But we should roll back on it before it\u0026rsquos too late. Anyone accused of anything should know the facts, the people involved, and they should be given a proper chance to defend themselves. Alex Salmond may be a hard man to feel sorry for \u0026ndash and his alpha-male personality around colleagues, journalists, and others may make him hard to like at times \u0026ndash but as an apparent victim of a flawed process, he deserves some sympathy.  There are other uncomfortable truths we\u0026rsquove learned from this affair, the first being how far some of Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos followers are prepared to go in demonstrating their loyalty. In the immediate aftermath of the press conference, some rushed to social media to suggest Mr Salmond was the victim of a Unionist/MI5/UK Government plot others suggested, wearyingly, that the BBC was using the furore to undermine Nicola Sturgeon. There was also some naked racism in the suggestion that all of it was happening because the civil servant in charge of the process, Leslie Evans, is a non-Scot and therefore non-us. The comments read like despatches from the Planet Loopy-de-Loo in the constellation of Ridiculous.  More worryingly, there were others \u0026ndash including women it must be said \u0026ndash who turned on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos accusers, calling them liars or suggesting even that they might have \u0026ldquothrown themselves at the former First Minister. There were also questions asked about why it had taken \u0026ldquoso long  for the complaints to be made, the implication being that complaints that are not made immediately might be fake. But didn\u0026rsquot we deal with all that kind of rubbish as part of the Me Too movement? Isn\u0026rsquot it sad that it\u0026rsquos all being spread again by supporters of independence in the name of defending their departed leader?  There are other interesting lessons to be drawn from all this about the SNP and the relationship between Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. On the party generally, it\u0026rsquos clear it now has only two strategies on public relations and any crisis: total control and total silence. The party has been known in recent years for its cast-iron unity  and, remarkably, it has held. But as the Salmond claims emerged, the machine went into lock-down and the press department refused to answer any calls or emails from journalists. That is a dereliction of a party\u0026rsquos responsibilities, especially in the face of what could reasonably be called a national crisis: a former First Minister suing the government of the current one.  Then there\u0026rsquos the relationship between those two people, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon. Both Mr Salmond and Leslie Evans were at pains to suggest the First Minister was not part of the process, but we know that\u0026rsquos a legal fiction at best \u0026ndash and it is one that will get harder to maintain, as the tortuous procedural reasons for not suspending Mr Salmond demonstrate.  As Ms Sturgeon herself suggested in her short statement, she and Mr Salmond have also been friends and confederates for years, even if the relationship has been under considerable strain for some time \u0026ndash firstly because of Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos show for the Russian broadcaster RT and now because of his decision to take legal action against the Scottish Government. The accusations against her old mentor have also obviously put the First Minister in an awkward position \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot forget all those times she defended Mr Salmond against accusations of sexism: the notorious Fringe joke for example, or the time he told the MP Anna Soubry to \u0026ldquobehave yourself, woman.  Ms Sturgeon will also be aware of the damage the accusations against her predecessor could do to an already divided party and movement. It was bad enough that Mr Salmond has been shooting his mouth off about a second referendum, but the new crisis makes the problem even worse. As we know, Ms Sturgeon has been aware of the claims against Mr Salmond for several months so no doubt she would have been factoring them in to her strategising, but even so the rapidly diminishing prospect of a second vote on independence has diminished even further. A quotation from a comedy sketch set in a pet shop and starring John Cleese may even be appropriate.  But what if I\u0026rsquom wrong and it does happen? What if there is a second referendum on Scottish independence? Well, this latest crisis, however it pans out, means that Alex Salmond \u0026ndash the leader of the Yes movement of 2014, the man who took Scotland so close to independence, and still the pre-eminent hero of the faithful \u0026ndash would not be able to campaign in it. Now, that would be something, wouldn\u0026rsquot it?"},{"url":null,"title":"tory-arrogance-on-brexit-likely-to-push-more-scots-to-back-independence-claims-snp","story":"  Peter Grant, the Nationalists\u0026rsquo Europe spokesman at Westminster, warned there is \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Conservative Government pursued a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.  SNP colleague Stephen Gethins added that \u0026ldquothe arrogant behaviour of the Tory Government\" is likely to make a growing number of people in Scotland \"see the benefits and attractions of independence\".  They spoke out after former European Council President Mr Van Rompuy argued that leaving the EU without an agreement would pose an \u0026ldquoexistential threat to the UK.  But the Scottish Conservatives have urged Mr Van Rompuy to \u0026ldquostop trying to interfere in UK domestic politics, while the Scottish Liberal Democrats warned against compounding \u0026ldquothe chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence.  In his controversial intervention, the ex-chief Eurocrat said: \u0026ldquoThe no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels, it is also an existential threat to the UK itself.  \u0026ldquoOne can imagine that a no-deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions. Speaking of Scotland, it could have consequences for them and others.  Mr Van Rompuy also told The Observer: \u0026ldquoWe could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of Nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.  His remarks echo recent ones from some senior SNP figures, who have equated a hard or no-deal Brexit with a renewed push for Scottish independence.  Responding to the former Brussels chief\u0027s intervention, Fife MP Mr Gethins said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory Government thinks it can do whatever it wants to Scotland with its shambolic, disastrous hard Brexit plans and get away with it.  \u0026ldquoScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and, since the referendum over two years ago, Scotland\u0026rsquos voice and votes have been ignored. At the same time, the Tory Government in Westminster is using Brexit as a means of ploughing ahead with its power-grab from the devolved administrations.  But Paul Masterton, of the Scottish Conservatives, dismissed Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks as \u0026ldquoutter nonsense.  The East Renfrewshire MP said: \u0026ldquoNo matter what the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, nothing will be helped by Scotland leaving the UK.  \u0026ldquoScots know that you don\u0026rsquot solve leaving one Union by leaving another one that is far more important to us economically.  \u0026ldquoRather than weigh in unnecessarily, Herman Van Rompuy should stop trying to interfere and let us get on with delivering a Brexit deal that will work for the whole of the UK.  Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, suggested nothing good could come of a no-deal Brexit.  Insisting a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the final deal was the \u0026ldquoonly logical way forward, he added: \u0026ldquoWe should not compound the chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence. Surely the lesson of Brexit is that breaking up is a bad idea?  Last week, following the publication of the first tranche of papers setting out Theresa May\u0026rsquos no-deal contingency plans, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that quitting the EU without an agreement would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster while her Scottish Cabinet colleague Michael Russell branded such a scenario a \u0026ldquonightmare.  In contrast, David Lidington, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos effective deputy, argued that a no-deal Brexit would in no way jeopardise the Union, saying the \u0026ldquostrength of the United Kingdom would continue regardless.  Earlier this month, the First Minister signalled that she was unlikely to be able to make a definitive decision on calling for a second independence referendum this autumn because of the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  However, both Brussels and London have indicated that people will know by early November whether or not a deal is doable. Ms Sturgeon could make her key announcement within days of this development although Mrs May has made clear repeatedly she would not facilitate a second independence poll.  Meanwhile, Downing Street, commenting on Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks, said: \u0026ldquoWe have always said the United Kingdom would continue to thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But we are confident of getting a good deal one that delivers for every part of the United Kingdom and takes back control of our money, laws and our borders. That is what this Government will deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-chair-special-cabinet-to-try-to-unify-colleagues-in-final-brexit-deal-push","story":"  The Prime Minister is preparing for a special Cabinet get-together in September when she hopes to eradicate the Brexit bickering and build a unified approach among colleagues ahead of the final push for a deal the last key brainstorming session at Chequers led to the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis.

It will begin the most intensive period on Brexit as the final deadline on any deal begins to near with Westminster returning from its summer recess on September 4, the special Brexit Cabinet due on September 13, the party conference season starting the same week, an informal EU summit in Salzburg on September 20, where the PM hopes to raise Brexit over dinner, and the European Council\u0026rsquos crunch meeting on Brexit on October 18/19.  After the Chancellor warned of a significant fiscal impact on the back of a no-deal \u0026ndash higher borrowing of \u0026pound80 billion a year - his former Cabinet colleague, David Davis lashed out at \"bogus\" Treasury forecasts.  The former Brexit Secretary and a leading Brexiteer accused Mr Hammond of being \"either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate\", adding: \"I know what I think.\"  He accused the Treasury of having \u0026ldquotrouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead\" and said Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments were an \u0026ldquoattempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.  Mr Davis went on: \"And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government\u0027s hand in striking a deal with the EU. If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.\"  Meanwhile, Mr Raab, in an interview with the Sunday Times, noted how the latest GDP estimates for 2019 had been \u0026ldquorevised up\".  Without naming Mr Hammond, he echoed Mr Davis, saying: \"I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.\" He suggested such fiscal projections had to be treated with a \u0026ldquomeasure of caution.  Elsewhere, Nigel Farage pledged to return to the stump to \u0026ldquorestart the Brexit campaign as Leave Means Leave announced a bid to create a \u0026pound5 million war-chest over the next three months.

Noting how the first campaign event would be in Bolton on September 22, he said: \u0026ldquoThis issue is above party politics and has never been a debate about left or right.

In a statement, Ms Sturgeon explained that the party had not received any complaints about her predecessor\u0027s conduct nor had it carried out the formal investigation. But, she stressed, the matter would be reconsidered if the situation were to change.  \"The party\u0027s rules apply to all members and no-one is above them,\" declared the FM.  She noted that, as with any other organisation, due process must be followed. Yet she pointed out: \u0026ldquoIn this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.  \"Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party. And, rightly, it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.  \"In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond\u0027s membership, added Ms Sturgeon.  The allegations about Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 - while he was in office - have now been handed to Police Scotland.  Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and the former SNP leader was notified in March about an investigation.  She had intended to make a statement but the move was halted after Mr Salmond initiated legal proceedings.  Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said it was \u0026ldquounderstood the FM and her predecessor had met on \u0026ldquomultiple occasions to discuss the case.  It called for publication of the times, dates and minutes of any such meetings as well as clarification about whether Mr Salmond had asked Ms Sturgeon to interfere in the investigation.  Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Women\u0026rsquos spokeswoman, declared: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland expect full transparency in this case. She stressed that it would be completely unacceptable if the details of any Sturgeon/Salmond meetings remained secret.  \u0026ldquoThe allegations against Alex Salmond are incredibly serious. His meetings with the head of a government that was investigating him must not be kept under wraps. Nicola Sturgeon must publish the details and minutes of these meetings as soon as possible.  \"The SNP must also do all it can to give complainants the support they need, whoever the alleged perpetrator is, and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.  Ms Grant added: \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should finally suspend Alex Salmond from the SNP immediately.  Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative Equalities spokeswoman, said, despite Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos latest statement, many questions remained unanswered.  \u0026ldquoWe are still none the wiser as to the way the assault was treated when it was alleged to have taken place, nor do we know when anyone in the SNP or the Scottish Government was informed about the incident.  She added: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister herself states, these are very serious allegations as such, they deserve to be taken seriously and that means seeing full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government as to how they handled it.  Jo Swinson for the Liberal Democrats stressed how people on all sides of the political divide needed to \u0026ldquoresist the temptation to make party political capital from a situation involving allegations of sexual harassment.  She explained: \u0026ldquoSupporters of Scottish independence should abandon Unionist conspiracy theories and supporters of the UK should be wary of immediately branding the SNP leadership of complicity.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important now is that the police investigation is able to proceed unimpinged by political pressure and it should proceed irrespective of the outcome of the Court of Session case.  \u0026ldquoAny flaws in the internal government process do not trump the imperative of a thorough investigation of the allegations by the police.  The Lib Dem deputy leader added: \u0026ldquoWe should be wary of inflammatory words and partisan statements which distract from the matter at hand and could discourage women and men, who have experienced similar situations, from coming forward."},{"url":null,"title":"professor-dame-sue-black-forensic-expert-haunted-by-unsolved-cases","story":"  Professor Dame Sue Black has helped identify victims and perpetrators of crime in war zones like Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and helped crack numerous criminal cases across the UK.

He\u0026rsquos a young man and we found his body hanging in the woodlands, very badly decomposed.  \u0026ldquoSomewhere surely that young man has got family who are missing him, and so I hate those situations where you have a body but you are not able to let them go home because you can\u0026rsquot find their name.  \u0026ldquoBy the same token, those incomplete circles where you know somebody is missing but you can\u0026rsquot find the body.  \u0026ldquoWe spent a lot of time trying to find Renee MacRae and her three year old son Andrew who went missing in Inverness in 1976.  \u0026ldquoWe spent a lot of time trying to find their remains, and Moira Anderson who went missing in Coatbridge in the 1950s.  \u0026ldquoNot finding these bodies whilst there is still family alive is really challenging, because they talk about when that person went missing that their life went in to stutter.

She left Dundee to become Pro Vice-Chancellor for Engagement at Lancaster University earlier this month.  Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, she added: \u0026ldquoI had a lovely letter from Renee MacRae\u0026rsquos sister saying that every time somebody digs to find where Renee might be she gets her hopes up again and then when we don\u0026rsquot find her she feels the same depression.  \u0026ldquoSo we don\u0026rsquot ever lose sight of the fact in our profession that there are living, breathing family waiting for that knock on the door that brings the bad news home but it\u0026rsquos a kind news as well as a bad news - it\u0026rsquos that certainty of knowing what\u0026rsquos happened.  \u0026ldquoAll Renee MacRae\u0026rsquos sister had said is \u0026lsquoall I want to do is to bring my sister home\u0026rsquo. \u0026lsquoI want to know where she is I want her in the ground I want to be able to visit her\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the same for Moira Anderson\u0026rsquos family.

The letter also accuses Pope Francis of having initially rehabilitated McCarrick despite being informed of his attitudes to young seminarians in 2013, soon after he was elected pope.          https:t.co/UlmCN46aui          \u0026mdash N. Catholic Register  August 26, 2018  The National Catholic Register and another conservative site, LifeSiteNews, published the letter attributed to Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano on Sunday as the pope was wrapping up a two-day visit to Ireland.  Mr Vigano, 77, a conservative whose hardline anti-gay views are well known, also urged the reformist pope to resign over the issue.  He and the pope have long been on opposite ideological sides, with the pope seen more as a pastor and Mr Vigano more a cultural warrior.  The Vatican did not immediately comment on the letter or confirm its authenticity.  In it, Mr Vigano accused the former Vatican secretaries of state under the previous two popes of having ignored detailed denunciations against McCarrick for years.  He said Pope Benedict XVI eventually sanctioned McCarrick in 2009 or 2010 to a lifetime of penance and prayer, but that Francis subsequently rehabilitated him.  Francis accepted McCarrick\u0026rsquos resignation as cardinal last month, after a US church investigation determined that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible.  Since then, another man has come forward saying McCarrick began molesting him starting when he was 11, and several former seminarians have said McCarrick abused and harassed them when they were in seminary.  The accusations have led to a crisis in confidence in the US hierarchy, because it was apparently an open secret that McCarrick regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.  Mr Vigano apparently sought to answer some of those questions. His letter identifies by name the Vatican cardinals and archbishops who were informed about the McCarrick affair, an unthinkable expose for a Vatican diplomat to make. He said documents backing up his version of events are in Vatican archives.  Mr Vigano, the Vatican\u0026rsquos ambassador to the US from 2011-2016, said his two immediate predecessors \u0026ldquodid not fail to inform the Holy See about accusations against McCarrick, starting in 2000.  He said Francis asked him about McCarrick when they met on June 23, 2013, at the Vatican\u0026rsquos Santa Marta hotel where the pope lives, three months after Francis was elected pope.  Mr Vigano wrote that he told Francis: \u0026ldquoHoly Father, I don\u0026rsquot know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation of Bishops, there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.  The pope declined to confirm or deny the claims.  Francis said the 11-page text by Mr Vigano, which reads as a homophobic manifesto and attack on Francis allies in parts, \u0026ldquospeaks for itself.  Francis was asked during an airborne press conference on Sunday if Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos claims that the two discussed McCarrick in 2013 were true.  The pope was also asked about Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos claims that McCarrick was already under sanction at the time, but that Francis rehabilitated him.  Francis said he had read Mr Vigano\u0026rsquos document and trusted journalists to judge for themselves and said: \u0026ldquoI won\u0026rsquot say a word about it."},{"url":null,"title":"pope-waves-goodbye-and-heads-back-to-rome","story":"  The pope was accompanied by the Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jude Thaddeus Okolo as he pulled up to the tarmac at Dublin Airport in a blue Skoda after saying mass in Phoenix Park.

Aer Lingus offered the Pope a traditional Irish meal while on board. It included a starter of Toons Bridge mozzarella with a leek salad and Irish soda bread.  For his main course he had a choice of baked smoked salmon with braised Savoy cabbage, glazed carrots and baby boiled potatoes or basil pesto risotto with roasted summer vegetables.  A passion fruit mousse and Cocoa Atelier chocolate bites were served for dessert.

James Ross, 47,  who worked in the warehouse advised the company he was suffering from an eye condition which meant he was losing his sight.                                                    The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 10:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locum psychiatrist costs health board 625000 a year ","story":"\nMembers of the board agreed at Tuesday’s meeting to advertise for a full-time consultant post.\nThe health board has a substantive consultant psychiatrist who has been in the job for the six months, as well as speciality doctor, and paying a locum consultant psychiatrist for 12 months.\nDirector of community health and social care Simon Bokor-Ingram said in a report to members that out of hours cover was being provided solely by a locum and this was not sustainable.\nLocum costs for a full year were £625,000, the board heard, whereas a consultant psychiatrist would be £166,000 a year.\nMembers were told while a budget would need to be made for a permanent post it would provide “resilience and sustainability” across the service.\nMr Bokor-Ingram said the decision to appoint permanently would also mean the board could look to someone who had a specialism in dementia or learning difficulties.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nMonday 27 Aug 2018 10:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/001WH1708NCA.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a level success at slemish college","story":"\nSlemish College is celebrating A Level exams success with 97% of students achieving three A Levels, with 83% of grades were at C or above. \n\n                \nThere were some outstanding individual achievements and over a third of grades were A or A*.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe majority of A levels subjects achieved 100% A*-C including Art, Hospitality and Catering, Business Studies, Further Maths,  Computing, Chemistry, Biology, English Literature, Health and Social Care, Media Studies, Physics, Environmental Technology, Sport, and Construction.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nActing Principal Mr Michael Bennett said: “All our students should feel very proud of their endeavours and we particularly want to thank our A2 students for all that they have contributed to Slemish College. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“We wish you well in future endeavours and know you will achieve amazing things.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

They were beaten 2-1 last weekend by Wick Academy which brought an end to their 21 match winning streak.\nRemarkably, that run didn\u0027t yield Highland League success as Cove Rangers lifted their sixth league title.\nHowever, their season exploits were rewarded as they tasted silverware in the Highland League Cup and Aberdeenshire Cup.\nDue to the Bannsiders\u0027 participation in the competition, the Northern Ireland Football League have had to re-arrange the Danske Bank Premiership fixture against Ballymena United.\nThe original date was set for Friday September 7 but this has now been changed to Tuesday September 25 with a 7:45pm kick-off at The Showgrounds.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8607316.1534771555!/image/image.jpg","title":"new barrel and bean is top notch coffee bar","story":"\nA new rustic-style coffee bar, Barrel and Bean, has opened in Dromore - creating 10 jobs, breathing new life into a vacant\u0026#160100-year-old building in Bridge Street and giving the town\u0026#8217s evening and night-time economy a much needed boost.\n\n                \nRecognising a gap in the market for enhancing the town’s hospitality provision not just during the day but also after 5pm, Barrel and Bean is a new venture by entrepreneur Jamie McCutcheon who also owns local business, HealthBod Fitness, which specialises in personal and group training.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlready the fledgling business is showing early signs of being a great success, with customers from the town and further afield flocking to the top-notch venue to sample a delectable selection of sweet and savoury food accompanied by a wide range of premium quality beverages.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKeen to show their support for the new business, Councillor Paul Greenfield accompanied by Councillor Mark Baxter and Alderman Paul Rankin, were among the first well-wishers to visit Barrel and Bean.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf course they could not leave without enjoying a refreshing cup of coffee and sampling some cake and tray bakes supplied by The Little Bakehouse, Dromore and Tasty Wee Numbers, Ballynahinch.\n\nEconomic Development and Regeneration Committee Chair, Councillor Paul Greenfield, commented: “Supporting the growth of a vibrant and thriving evening and night-time economy in all urban centres in the borough is a key council priority – so it’s great to see Dromore benefit from this new investment.\n\nWith its newly expanded visitor offering, Dromore has an equally important role to play in strengthening the evening and night-time economy, and like other towns in the borough should be viewed among prospective hospitality providers as an attractive destination for investment.\n\nBarrel and Bean is already delivering big gains for the town – creating employment, rejuvenating a disused building, encouraging locals and visitors to socialise in the town well into evening and acting as a catalyst for further investment. I wish Jamie and his team every success in the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council has recently approved a new five-year Evening Economy Development strategy, supporting its growth and diversification, in particular within strategic areas of night-time activity.\n\nThe strategy incorporates retail, arts, culture and leisure and supports and promotes existing businesses in their evening operations, encourages the extension of day time activities and strives to attract new evening uses and events that add to the evening economy.\n\nAn individual action plan has also been produced for all six urban centres, reflecting each centre’s unique and diverse assets, and identifying priorities for promoting their continued growth.\n\nBarrel and Bean is open Tuesday and Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , Saturday  and Sunday .\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"excitement ahead of pope visit","story":"\n\nCATHOLIC\n churches around the city are bedecked with bunting and Papal flags as excitement builds ahead of the historic visit from the Holy Father Pope Francis to Ireland this weekend.\nThe momentous visit is being held to mark the World Meeting of Families , staged every three years for families to celebrate, pray and reflect together. This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow  so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today  for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ban on cruel animal shock collars wont extend to northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

an electric pulse of ying strength or spray noxious chemicals at the animal. \n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is this week expected to announce the move to prohibit their sale, the Mail on Sunday has reported. \n\nThe newspaper said the Environment Secretary has branded the collars \"punitive devices\" which \"can cause harm and suffering, whether intentionally or unintentionally, to our pets\". \n\nUse of the collars has been banned in Wales, and earlier this year Scotland began moves towards prohibiting dog owners from using them. \n\nThe Government can ban the devices in England, and potentially here. \n\nHowever, it has deliberately avoided introducing legislation affecting Northern Ireland while Stormont is not functioning, meaning it could be the only part of the UK where the practice can continue.\n\nThe devices cause dogs to yelp, squeal, crouch and exhibit physiological signs of distress, the Dogs Trust has previously said. \n\nAnd despite being sold to improve the way dogs behave, they can actually worsen an animal\u0027s behaviour, the charity stressed. \n\nPolling for the Dogs Trust earlier this year showed almost a third of people  wrongly thought the collars, which can continuously shock a dog for 11 seconds, were already banned.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it  but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes , sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017  ied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry schoolgirl janda makes croke park address","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

homes.\n\nIrish Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone gave him a memo about Tuam.\n\nFrancis told reporters including Irish broadcaster RTE on Sunday evening: “I had never heard of these mothers, they call it the laundromat of women where an unwed woman is pregnant and goes into these hospitals, I don’t know what they call them, schools, run by the nuns and then they gave children to the people in adoption.”\n\nThe Pope vowed to pursue justice for victims of church abuse in Ireland as he ended his historic visit to the country by seeking forgiveness for its dark litany of clerical crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPope Francis speaks to reporters during the flight to Rome \n\n\n\n\nAddressing a large crowd of pilgrims at an open air Mass in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, Francis laid bare the many forms of abuse and mistreatment meted out to children and vulnerable adults in past decades.\n\nOn Sunday, around 500 people gathered for the silent vigil in Tuam to coincide with the Papal Mass.\n\nThey walked from Tuam Town Hall for 30 minutes to the former site of the mother and baby home while stopping at poignant spots along the way, including the local graveyard.\n\nBaby shoes, toys and teddy bears were tied to the railings along the route.\n\nThey gathered at the site where remains of infant bones have been found, which was managed by the Sisters of the Bon Secours between 1925 and 1961.\n\nIn 2013, local historian Catherine Corless discovered official records showing that around 800 children died at the home in Tuam.\n\nIn March, a commission of investigation announced it had found “a significant number of human remains” at the site.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"adrian chiles ive had alcohol nearly every day

But I think we’re conning ourselves.\n\n“It’s just that our friends all happen to drink.\n\n“And I’ve realised we’re probably friends with them in the first place because they, like us, drink.”\n\nChiles has previously said that coming to terms with the amount of alcohol he had been drinking has been a wake-up call, and that he wants to cut down.\n\nDrinkers Like Me airs on Monday at 9pm on BBC Two.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"how popular is your use of emoji","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https:www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged visit arts exhibitions held unusual spaces across derry","story":"\nThree visual arts exhibitions have opened in unexpected places across Derry, including a bar and a park\n\nThey are taking place in the Walled City Brewery, The Gate Lodge and Gywns Café in Brooke Park and The Fashion and Textile Centre.\n\nA further exhibition will take place in the Sion Stables in Sion Mills.\n\nIn the Walled City Brewery, Yarli Allison has created a fake news television broadcast that can be seen on a television in the bar.

If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

Fortunately, on-one was injured.\n\nHowever, local people were puzzled that the nearby coastguard services did not promptly answer an emergency call and the incident led local councillor George Flinn to call for a review of rescue procedures.\n\nMr Flinn was given his answer this week in a frank letter from the coastguard service, which admitted there had been a 17-minute delay.\n\nHe was told in the letter, read to Down councillors, that the RNLI is currently reviewing the type of life craft and the methods used along the Down coastline and it will be taking into account the incident at Coney Island.\n\nThe letter pointed out that it was ironic that the coastguard had identified the Killough area as a likely accident spot on that day because of the water sports being held as part of the village\u0026rsquos festival weekend.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe failure of radio units meant they could not assist the young men in canoes at Coney Island.

In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly.

If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night.
