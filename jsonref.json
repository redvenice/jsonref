The amount we spend on pampered pets is rising, up to £7 billion a year.‘Pet owners are increasingly treating their cats, dogs and even small mammals like members of their family,’ says a spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor.He puts it down to single people becoming increasingly lonely and couples delaying marriage and children so that pets are often the choice for their love and affection.The scale of this TV series — which involves a team of vets and animal behaviour experts to advise on issues — highlights how loopy we all are about our pets. It runs over four weeks, with episodes airing on a daily basis — starring 60 problem pets.Not surprisingly, dogs feature heavily. There are dogs with halitosis, dogs who like to rip up carpets, dogs who steal underwear, and a particularly poignant tale of a dog with an obsessive licking habit.          King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animalsTitch is a Jack Russell and Yorkie cross who leaves every surface covered in drool. When they bring in the experts, however, a poignant story emerges. His owner recently died and his obsessive behaviour is put down to extreme grief. Sob.It’s the more unusual animals that leave viewers scratching their heads, though.So we meet a tortoise called Dandelion with a habit of attacking people’s feet (it can move astonishingly quickly, for a tortoise), a sheep called Shaun who seems a tad psychotic, and an army of birds who have turned their homes into no-go zones.The series features not one but two hedgehogs. The owner of the first is concerned because he has been pulling out his own spines. Can a hedgehog self-harm? Possibly, but the vet believes it’s more likely caused by tiny mites.\u0027One in a million\u0027 photograph captures 60,000 swooping...The SECRET desert Tommies: Unseen images reveal for the...Share this articleEllie took Freddie along because she was at ‘the end of my tether’ with his eating.‘One of his big treats used to be those little Dreamies cat biscuits, with the soft insides, but the more he wanted the chicken nuggets, the more he rejected even these. We were worried that there was actually something wrong with him, physically, that he couldn’t manage hard food.’The problem — and this is a recurring theme with this jaw-dropping series — was more that Freddie had started to believe he was a human.Who can blame him, when it turns out Freddie also gets to watch TV and is spoiled with Christmas presents?Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and Will fell in love with him instantly.          Bird company: Angelica Hambis and her screeching cockatiel Rosie, who \u0027has an attitude problem\u0027‘He’s our baby,’ she says solemnly. ‘He knows I’m his mum and Will is his dad.’Freddie rules the household. ‘He’s a bit of a a,’ confirms Ellie. His cage sits in the living room, and every night (he’s nocturnal, so tends to get up about 10.30pm) he is allowed out to scurry around the sofa.‘He likes to hide behind the cushions,’ says Ellie.One is his cushion, to be fair. ‘It was his Christmas present. It’s got his face on it.’In his two-level cage, he has his own duvet and a hamster wheel on a mezzanine level. Needless to say, the experts have their work cut out with Freddie — and Ellie and Will. First stop is convincing them hedgehogs don’t necessarily see McDonald’s as a treat.‘It’s a common problem,’ says one of the show’s behavioural experts, Caroline Clark. ‘I’ve never come across a hedgehog liking chicken nuggets before, but owners can get into habits that aren’t necessarily in their pet’s long-term interest.‘The key is getting them to understand how the animal would behave in the wild.’Juliette Stevens, 50, attended the Embarrassing Pets clinic with her alpaca, Gus. Juliette has a herd at her Derbyshire farm, but Gus isn’t like the others.‘He thinks he’s human, always has,’ she confides. ‘It turns out his mother wasn’t able to feed him at birth and he was hand-reared. This means he actually thinks he’s a human. When I put him in the field with my other alpacas, he ignored them.’While Juliette is tempted to treat Gus as a human herself (‘he’s such an affectionate soul, when he’s in a good mood, that I can imagine letting him share my bedroom’), she’s also become concerned because of his bad behaviour.          Bannister vandalising parrot Rocco, who can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork‘If he isn’t getting enough attention, he will attack,’ she says. ‘He will have a go at people — hissing and spitting at them. And alpaca spit isn’t just spit. They regurgitate the contents of their stomach and hurl it at people. It’s quite disgusting.’Gus does this to the neighbours. He’s also attacked other alpacas. ‘If he was a human, he’d be a human with an Asbo,’ Juliette says, quite cheerily, in the circumstances.In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck. Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg.‘Charlotte was at a sleepover on a farm, and the egg started to hatch — and there was Charlie peeking out at her,’ explains her mum, Carli, 43.‘She came home and said: “Mum, I’ve got a duckling. Can we keep it?” I said we could —for a few weeks — but as he got bigger, he was adorable, and so he stayed for good. He followed Charlotte around. He wouldn’t leave her side. He thought she was his mummy.’This is a recognised phenomenon, says Caroline Clark. ‘It’s called imprinting.’          In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck Carli admits: ‘We call him the most pampered duck in Cheshire. We built him his own pond. He doesn’t really get to come into the house — ducks have no bowel control, we learned that the hard way.’Alas, ducks have instincts, and Caroline quickly assesses that Charlie is frustrated. While his instincts are telling him to forage for food, and mate when he pleases, his environment isn’t allowing that. Solution number one is to throw away his food bowl.‘In the wild they expend a lot of energy looking for their own food,’ explains Caroline. ‘The first step was to try to establish a version of that.’ Cue his family having fun ‘throwing lettuce and spinach around’, as Carli puts it.What about Charlie’s aggressive behaviour? He had taken to attacking visitors and — mortifyingly — getting amorous with his teddy. The family are gently advised that by providing him with his toy when he was badly behaved, they were rewarding his behaviour, and compounding the problem.‘Aggression is usually a symptom of another problem, and quite often it’s about an animal being frustrated,’ says Caroline. She likens her job to ‘putting a jigsaw together’. Some puzzles are more difficult to fathom than others. Everyone is baffled by the case of lovable collie Mac. Until recently he was a dream dog for owner Claire Curran, 38 — one who loved his walks. Then one day, something happened.          Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg (pictured: Charlotte and mother Carli Short)‘We still don’t know what. Maybe we will never know. He disappeared one day and was missing for about an hour. Someone found him and rang my number, as it was on his collar. When we got him back he was a nervous wreck,’ says Claire.Overnight, Mac had gone from being a confident dog to a collie with the collywobbles.‘He wouldn’t stop shaking. We couldn’t get him into the car, and when we did, we couldn’t get him out again. He’d slink behind me. He didn’t even want to go out in the garden. It was as if he’d been spooked by something.’They never did find out what happened to Mac — and rebuilding his confidence is painstaking.So is treating Rosie the cockatiel, whose owner, Angelica Hambis, 19, is in despair. Trainee jockey Angelica, who lives in Enfield, is a natural with animals. But Rosie is a law unto herself. ‘She has an attitude problem. It’s a girl thing. She doesn’t want to do what she doesn’t want to do.’Rosie’s issues — ear-splitting shrieking, and a refusal to be handled — seem to stem from trauma, though. Angelica got Rosie via an advert on the Preloved website when she was one, and was horrified to see the conditions she lived in. ‘It was in the middle of winter. It was so cold and she didn’t even have a blanket over her cage.’She installed Rosie in her own living room, near the TV and by a fish tank, so she had plenty to look at. Rosie has trust issues, though.‘She has some sort of phobia of my hands,’ Angelica reveals. ‘Every time I put them near her, she bites, hisses at me and runs away to the back of her cage.’ Another bird behaving badly is Rocco the parrot, who lives in Urmston, Manchester, with owner Mike Long, 54, but clearly still thinks he’s in the rainforest.Rocco, five, is Mike’s constant companion, and even accompanies him to the pub. ‘He walks up and down the bar. He loves all the attention,’ says Mike.Rocco, who has his own Twitter account, can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork. He also has quite a vocabulary, even if his language can be as colourful as his plumage (‘he watches a lot of football,’ says Mike). But his screeching and biting has driven the family mad.So far, Rocco’s main victim has been the bannisters in the family home, which have fallen foul of his talons. But as Caroline explains: ‘In the wild, parrots would strip the bark off trees. The nearest equivalent is, unfortunately, the bannisters.’A lot of Rocco’s bad behaviour, however, is put down to a more human trait — attention seeking. ‘We were told that by responding to his hysterics, we were encouraging him to screech more,’ says Mike. The solution? ‘When he plays up, we ignore him. It’s already starting to work.’As the owners in this series are fast discovering — it’s often their behaviour under the spotlight.The Embarrassing Pets series is available on ALL 4 on Channel 4."},{"url":null,"title":"Private schools diverse state schools","story":"     Leading headteachers have said that many private schools are more erse than their top state counterparts because they admit more poor pupilsWealthy parents are prepared to pay extra for properties next to top schools and, if necessary, pay for tuition to help their children pass entrance exams. Sue Hincks, the GSA’s president-elect for 2019 and head of Bolton School Girls’ Division, said: ‘In a school like ours which offers one in five bursaries, of which the majority are going to children on free school meals, we know we have a very socially erse population in front of us.‘Those children are selected on ability, but they also come because we are offering them a funded place, including a free school meal.Fake teacher who forged documents to hide his criminal...Parents are the biggest school cheats: As these mothers...Share this article‘That is a percentage that compares very favourably with what would be happening in local state grammar schools, where many of the children are there because they are able but they are also in the catchment area.‘And the catchment area has house prices which are such that you would have to have a relatively good income in order to be able to go to the school.’          Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursariesThe GSA said the same pattern was seen in a number of its schools.Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursaries. She added: ‘Fee-paying parents, who can easily afford our fees, will tell me that they’ve chosen us over other independent day schools in London because of that.‘They think it indicates the moral compass of the school and also they prefer for their daughters to be educated in a socially erse community.’ The heads were talking at the annual conference of the GSA in Marble Arch, central London, yesterday.The charitable status of private schools, which gives them generous tax breaks, is in the spotlight. The Government wants them to prove their worth as charitable institutions to keep the privilege.The GSA said its schools were already helping disadvantaged children, including partnering with state schools to share teachers and facilities.Figures from 192.com show that school catchment houses cost up to £70,000 more.Some parents even rent or buy a second property near their chosen school to ensure their child gets a place. "},{"url":null,"title":"John Glen Economic Secretary City minister wants end macho Mad Men culture workplace","story":"    Economic Secretary and City minister John Glen (pictured) has called for more to be done to crack down on \u0027macho\u0027 culture in the workplace in Britain Bosses need to do more to end \u0027macho Mad Men\u0027 culture and \u0027backwards attitudes\u0027 towards women in the workplace, according to a Treasury minister.The Government launched its Women in Finance charter in 2016 to get more women in senior roles in in the industry.Yesterday it was announced 300 companies have now signed up to the scheme, but Economic Secretary and City minister John Glen insists there is still more to be done.Speaking to business leaders yesterday Glen called for companies to appoint \u0027male ersity champions\u0027.They would promote ersity, become allies to women in the office and encourage men to take shared parental leave, while \u0027backwards attitudes\u0027 towards female members of staff at finance firms still exist, reports The Telegraph.  He told business leaders: \u0027Words alone will not buck decades of indifference.\u0027We need deeds and I am calling on men working in financial services today to help confront this problem.\u0027It is 2018 - corporate attitudes have to change and you must embrace gender equality.\u0027 His warnings come after five men fired from one of the UK\u0027s top advertising agencies claimed they were dismissed because of a \u0027new kind of racism\u0027 against white, straight men.The group of former JWT London employees are lodging claims of racism and sexism against their old bosses.They were told to leave their roles following the appointment of a new creative director Jo Wallace.

Rivers have dried up, people have lost their lives searching for water and thousands of animals have perished  In a desperate bid to provide their families and animals with water, the Turkana tribe are digging dangerous 12-feet holes. Thirsty camels and goats take it in turns to be supplied with water by their owners who depend on the animals for everything, including food and help transporting their manyatta huts          A young girl, wearing traditional  neck beads and showing signs of malnutrition, carries a plastic yellow water carton above her head as she walks across the parched land           Siblings use their donkeys and a handwoven basket to carry their water bottles across the barren landscape to a deep water hole dug by the village\u0027s women in Labei, located around 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of LodwarDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027\u0027Mini Beast from East\u0027 brings icy winds, rain and sleet across UKPC Kevin Sutherland on shortages in Hartlepool after budget cutsClive Lewis accused of mocking suicide during Commons debateSnow blankets Sussex as \u0027Mini Beast from the East\u0027 sets inBag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadFergie says \u0027old Fergie was back\u0027 at Harry and Meghan\u0027s weddingMum\u0027s desperate plea to father accused of \u0027sacrificing\u0027 babySpain may vote down Brexit deal if Gibraltar plans don\u0027t changeJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferencePolice officers savagely beaten in brutal attack in South LondonHere women, including those that are pregnant, walk around 12 miles each day in an unimaginable quest to find water in one of the driest places on earth. If successful, they carry 20-litre cartons atop of their heads back to their children, husbands and animals. A family has an average of 10 children.In the village of Labei, we encountered young women, adorned with beautiful colourful neck beads and their trademark mohawk-style haircut, carry out the exhausting work of lifting water up to the surface from a 12-foot hole they had dug with their hands and a small spade.They estimated the newly formed waterhole, named Sasak Echoke, contained enough brown liquid to last them just a few days.At the top of the hole, men and children poured buckets of the pungent water into makeshift troughs for the camels, goats and donkeys to drink from. These animals are the nomadic tribe\u0027s livelihood. In their polygamous society, camels are used as dowry when a man wants to make a woman his wife. Men take as many wives as they can afford and girls are believed to be ready for marriage as soon as they hit puberty, despite Kenyan law stating both men and women must be 18 before they can wed.  A mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi told how she had recently lost her daughter (right) for two days while she was out searching for water. Thankfully she was found alive            A woman was recently killed when one of the pits collapsed on her and her body remains buried at the site          The woman scooped brown dirty water from the hole which locals estimated would last them just a few more days. Conflicts have broken out between different villages fighting for water            The Turkana tribe, which is the second largest pastoralist community in Kenya after the Maasais, live in one of the harshest and most inhospitable places on EarthMeanwhile, goats - and their blood - are a main food source for the tribe. The animals can also be sold for weapons, which are now much needed to protect the tribe from livestock raids by other groups. Men in the village, which is more than 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of Lodwar,  are having to trek as far as the Ugandan border to graze their animals and conflicts have occurred.We spoke to a mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi, with the help of the local government chief Simon Moya acting as a translator, who told us how she had recently lost her daughter for two days while she was out searching for water.\u0027I have 46 donkeys and drive them for three miles to get water,\u0027 she explained. Remarkably in this arid landscape, the child was found alive and the pair were reunited.Another family\u0027s story had no such happy ending. One father told us how his son died when they were out grazing their goats away from home and ran out of water.          Turkana women all wear similar hairstyles and only shave their head completely when their husband dies. They adorn themselves with colourful beads  made from glass, seeds, cowry shells or iron and don\u0027t remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative. Married women will also wear a plain metal ring around the neck, acting as a wedding ring          Camels are one of only three types of animals that have survived the drought. All the tribe\u0027s sheep have died. Boys and men are in charge of herding the livestock and taking them to graze, a job that in this climate can take days to complete            Children in the community are involved in collecting water which means they don’t get any schooling          Young boys involved in caring for animals are seen holding canes as they take their livestock to graze and find water           The village dug their water hole in the area after noticing this thriving tree, which indicated to them that there was water underground          Donkey parents and their babies catch some shade away from the midday sun. Temperatures in this part of Turkana in November often reach 36 degrees           Turkana people are polygamous, meaning men often have more than one wife. Camels are used  as a dowry, with some brides being \u0027sold\u0027 for as many as 200 of the animals           Hardy goats survive despite the desolate landscape. Locals cook them, drink their blood and sell them for weapons          Women in Labei described the extreme difficulties they are facing as they try to find water for their children. They are forced to leave them alone from sunrise to sunset as they go out searching. The children appeared malnourished and lethargic           Mothers carry 20 litre cartons of water atop of their heads and children have invented ways to help out by kicking and rolling bottles           While driving through bone-rattling desert, we found a group of men starting to dig a new hole with a small spade. Turkana men carry small seats carved out of wood which double up as pillows when they sleepIncidents of male suicides have also been reported, along with thousands of animal deaths. Many of the tribe are unaware of the concept of climate change and still believe that there is a curse and a sacrifice is needed to cure the drought.During MailOnline\u0027s meeting with this community, we saw the striking effect dehydration was having on the tribe\u0027s children. They appeared listless and laid under the tree in the shade, too lethargic to even swat away flies.\u0027Children have cooked blood from camels and goats for their daily meal,\u0027 Chief Simon said. \u0027Morning to sunset people are fighting for water,\u0027 he added.The current average life expectancy in the region is around 50 years old.In stark contrast to the desperate scenes in Labei, the following day we visited a project that has offered hope to some Turkana people as the rains show no sign of returning.British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA), which helps working animals around the world and the communities that rely on them, have stepped in to help by providing a £45,000 solar-powered borehole.Located a bone-rattling two and a half hour drive from the small town of Lodwar, the community fortunate enough to receive the lifeline are rarely visited by aid groups because of their extremely remote location.          Overjoyed tribeswomen greeted us with dancing and singing as we arrived at a new solar-powered borehole paid for by British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA) and implemented by their local partner Practical ActionDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027\u0027Mini Beast from East\u0027 brings icy winds, rain and sleet across UKPC Kevin Sutherland on shortages in Hartlepool after budget cutsClive Lewis accused of mocking suicide during Commons debateSnow blankets Sussex as \u0027Mini Beast from the East\u0027 sets inBag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadFergie says \u0027old Fergie was back\u0027 at Harry and Meghan\u0027s weddingMum\u0027s desperate plea to father accused of \u0027sacrificing\u0027 babySpain may vote down Brexit deal if Gibraltar plans don\u0027t changeJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferencePolice officers savagely beaten in brutal attack in South London    These women now live close to their borehole and no longer have to spend all day going to find water. \u0027We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you,\u0027 one mother said           The tribe live in small dwellings called manyattas made from palm leaves, wood, and animal skins. Mothers and their children live in a separate hut to the husband, who sleeps in his own one which is suitable for conjugal visits          A married woman rests inside her manyatta with a small relative, surrounded by tradition animal skin water carriers            A young girl carries a baby and a tub of water away from the borehole as goats and camels take their turn to drink The 110-metre borehole is deep enough to reach the water table and is providing fresh, clean water for 4,200 people and 9,000 animals. This is thousands more than first estimated.As we pulled up to the borehole, women surrounded our cars dancing, singing and ululating in a loud and colourful welcome. Inquisitive children stared, pointed at our cameras and giggled as we showed them their photos. Even the men, holding their traditional canes and the small wooden stools they use as seats and pillows, broke out into a performance of thanks.\u0027This water has improved their lives,\u0027 said Chief Simon. \u0027The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together,\u0027 he explained.The women dressed in colourful robes, including married ladies marked out by the silver rings around their necks, described how they can now wash again and take pride in their appearance.The tribe sleep in huts, called manyattas, made from leaves and adorned with animal hides. Women reside in a hut with their children, while a husband has his own hut for women to visit him.          Camels formed an orderly line to drink from their new trough. Water is pumped from the solar-powered borehole into troughs for animals - big and small - after just two hours of bright sunshine. \u0027The effect of this project is quite clear, it’s absolutely amazing,\u0027 said SPANA Chief Executive Geoffrey Dennis          Children living in the village by the borehole were brimming with energy.  Some of them may now be able to attend school and there are hopes to build a medical centre nearby          Community chief Simon Moya (pictured, rear) said: \u0027This water has improved their lives. The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together\u0027  The £45,000 solar-powered borehole was sponsored by SPANA and built with the help of Practical Action.

Pictured right: Turkana woman Awesit Naukay who is on the water committee           Women arrive with their  containers to gather clean water from the new borehole. The solar-powered technology provides water from 110 metres underground One mother sparked laughter among the whole group as she told us: \u0027Men used to be tired when they came home without water but now the family unit is happier… husbands used to disappear but now they come home.\u0027A water committee, made up of five local men and four women, has been formed to manage the borehole and they have agreed to a yearly fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (£3.80) per household to maintain it. The solar-powered technology is not just environmentally sustainable but also low maintenance.One woman on the committee, Awesit Naukay, said: \u0027Now we share water with our neighbours when we used to fight with them, they used to raid our livestock and take them away.\u0027Young boys and girls are now healthy and none have died since we got water. We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you.\u0027\u0027We are going to bring a school and health facility here because of this water,\u0027 added Chief Simon.Not only are the people healthier but the tribe\u0027s animals are also thriving and wild fruits have begun to grow once more. One village elder said he hopes to start rearing sheep again after they all died in the drought.Because the tribe\u0027s basic need for water has now been met thanks to the borehole, the women are starting to think of business ideas and options for sending their children to school.

There have been conflicts in the past and we need to be aware that this could happen in the future.\u0027SPANA receives no government funding but Mr Dennis believes the UK government \u0027should do more\u0027.\u0027If this area continues with very few rains for the next few years, which it probably will, there will be a lot of people who start drifting towards Nairobi and people will think let\u0027s move to Europe or wherever, so I very strongly encourage people to support people in the communities and keep them there.\u0027\u0027I hope we can have more projects similar to this, the people are amazing they are really friendly people, I have high hopes that we will develop happy communities that actually have a good livelihood and that\u0027s exactly what we saw here,\u0027 he added.One striking mother-of-six, named Atir Acheme, summed up the mood of the village as she told us: \u0027I\u0027m happy because no one is thirsty here, even our livestock.\u0027Our children are lively and playing.

It was then she offered to breastfeed the stranger\u0027s hungry baby.\u0027I informed my line administrator who was on board of the dilemma and when I suggested I breastfeed the child myself, she didn\u0027t hesitate in giving me permission,\u0027 says Organo.\u0027It was an emergency situation and with no formula on board, and a wailing infant, it was the right thing to do.\u0027Organo says she took the baby and her mother to the galley of the aircraft where she proceeded to breastfeed.\u0027The other passengers had no idea what was happening,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was all done very privately with just me, the line administrator, the mother and the baby sharing the experience.\u0027            She says Philippines Airlines encourage employees to \u0027make sure passengers know that Filipino people have caring hearts\u0027  Organo is pictured with her own daughter, Jade, and husband Orson. Because her job requires her to be away from her baby for days at a time, she says she always brings her breast pumping kit with her at work When asked if the baby\u0027s mother hesitated at all to allow a stranger to nurse her child, Organo responded: \u0027There was no hesitation from the child\u0027s desperate mother at all. In fact she was very thankful and relieved, and to her utter joy once the baby was fed, she slept soundly until it was time to deplane.\u0027I know there are people who might worry about allowing a total stranger to nurse their child because the wet- nurse might not be healthy, or drug free. \u0027But as a flight attendant, I am required to undergo annual physical checkups that insure I am able to fly. I am also breastfeeding my own baby which makes me very aware of my responsibility to take care of my body and remain healthy.\u0027As a working mother I must be away from my daughter for days at a time, I always bring my breast pumping kit with me whenever I leave for work. \u0027The kit includes a breast pump, milk bags, cooler bags and other cleaning equipment so I am able to keep my milk and bring it home to my daughter. I plan to keep nursing my own little girl as long as she needs my milk.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027Next time bring a wheelchair!\u0027 Heartless...Share this article\u0027Suffice to say that although I haven\u0027t nursed another baby in flight, this is not the first time I\u0027ve donated my milk to a baby other than mine. \u0027My husband is very supportive and he was happy I could help the young mother and her child. \u0027During the early days when I would become frustrated with trying to breastfeed, it was my husband Orson who encouraged me to keep going.\u0027My company was also very supportive,\u0027 she said. \u0027I actually got a recognition from them acknowledging what I did.\u0027\u0027Sharing such an intimate experience with another woman and her baby was very rewarding,\u0027 says Organo. \u0027The mother and I exchanged information and we are still in touch.

He is an American gentleman who was able to read online about the abuse and he decided to come over to the UK and cause problems.

A lower score showed they were not in danger.The nine questions were: In the past 12 months:How often have you found yourself thinking about gambling or planning to gamble? (2.3 per cent in the survey said they had)How often have you gambled to help you escape from problems or when you were feeling bad? (2.1 per cent)Have you felt bad or fed up when trying to cut down on gambling? (1.8 per cent)Have you needed to gamble with more and more money to get the amount of excitement you want? (2 per cent)Have you ever spent much more than you planned to spend on gambling? (1.2 per cent)Have you ever taken money without permission to spend on gambling? (3.9 per cent)Has your gambling ever led to arguments with family or friends, or you missing school? (2.7 per cent)Have you ever told lies because of gambling? (2.4 per cent)After losing money by gambling, have you returned another day to try to win back the money you lost? (1.9 per cent)                         The report was based on an Ipsos Mori study of 2,865 11 to 16-year-olds between February and July 2018. They were assessed as either a ‘problem’ or an ‘at risk’ gambler on the basis of questions about their behaviour.These included how often they thought about gambling, if they had stolen to fund stakes or if betting had ever led them to lie to their parents.It found the most common route into gambling were fruit machines in pubs or arcades and cash bets with friends.Some children admitted using betting shops or online gambling sites, both of which are illegal for under-18s.The study revealed that one in seven boys followed betting brands on social media sites including Facebook and Instagram. It concluded there were 55,000 problem child gamblers – 1.7 per cent of children aged 11 to 16. This was 42,000 more than in 2016.The 70,000 at risk of addiction represent 2.2 per cent of the age group.Last week three families, whose sons killed themselves after becoming addicted to gambling, said their children had started aged 17 or under on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals or fruit machines.Liz Ritchie’s son Jack took his own life aged 24 after gambling with his school dinner money. She said: ‘We need tougher enforcement to restrict children’s access to gambling, a ban on advertising that has normalised gambling in children’s minds and a clear public health warning that includes the high suicide risk of gambling.’Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, which represents some of the major betting firms, said: ‘There are still far too many children gambling. We’ve all got to do more to push that number down.‘We would say that the number who are problem gamblers is unacceptable, but a lot of it is outside of our control.‘On the advertising, the link between children gambling and advertising isn’t clear-cut but we are mindful that there are genuine concerns.‘Hopefully the review process we’re in at the moment will resolve that.’The association, which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill, reportedly met yesterday to discuss a complete ban on pre-watershed advertising.Last week ministers made a U-turn over their decision to delay the implementation of a £2 maximum stake on FOBTs after a campaign by the Daily Mail.Loot boxes in computer games are used to redeem bonuses such as weapons and costumes – and it is feared the element of chance mirrors gambling.  We must ALL act to protect kids By Tim Miller, Executive Director of the Gambling CommissionThere\u0027s no doubt that today’s figures on children and gambling should make people sit up and listen.But while discussions about children gambling might conjure up images of kids sneaking into bookies or sitting alone on their iPads gambling on an online casino, our latest research paints a more complex picture.The most common activities that children gamble on are not licensed casinos, bingo providers or bookies. Instead we found children preferred to gamble in informal environments, out of sight of regulation – private bets between friends or playing cards with their mates for money.We also found them gambling in places where parents might be expected to be present – scratch cards in supermarkets or fruit machines in pubs. Just in the last week we found that nearly 90 per cent of pubs tested failed to prevent children from gambling on fruit machines. These may not be gambling businesses but nevertheless have a duty to protect young people because we know that no form of gambling is risk free.Of course, none of this will ert us from our core duty to protect children from the types of gambling offered by companies we regulate. We continue to take action when children are not properly protected by gambling companies and keep raising the standards of protections in place.Earlier this year we set proposals to strengthen age verification for online gambling sites, including putting free-to-play games behind an age check.In October we introduced new rules which mean we can directly take action, including imposing fines, against gambling businesses that break advertising rules (such as advertising that appeals to children or glamourises gambling).But our actions alone won’t stop children being exposed to gambling-style activities in video games or in the app store. They won’t protect the child who has been given access by a parent to their online gambling account. They won’t prevent the playground or the bedroom from becoming a poker den.Protecting children from harm requires a joined-up approach: a strong, effective regulator, parents and teachers who understand and talk about the risks that can come from gambling, businesses, both in the gambling industry and outside, that act responsibly.It is by working hand in hand that we can help to keep our kids safe."},{"url":null,"title":"Help pet hedgehog hooked chicken nuggets","story":"    Freddie the African Pygmy hedgehog (pictured) refuses to eat anything but chicken nuggets    Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and boyfriend Will Saunders fell in love with him instantly As Ellie, who works in retail, says: ‘Everything revolves around Freddie.’King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animals — and (whisper it!) their equally challenged owners.Britain may be a pet-loving nation, but this show suggests we’ve let the creatures take over. The amount we spend on pampered pets is rising, up to £7 billion a year.‘Pet owners are increasingly treating their cats, dogs and even small mammals like members of their family,’ says a spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor.He puts it down to single people becoming increasingly lonely and couples delaying marriage and children so that pets are often the choice for their love and affection.The scale of this TV series — which involves a team of vets and animal behaviour experts to advise on issues — highlights how loopy we all are about our pets. It runs over four weeks, with episodes airing on a daily basis — starring 60 problem pets.Not surprisingly, dogs feature heavily. There are dogs with halitosis, dogs who like to rip up carpets, dogs who steal underwear, and a particularly poignant tale of a dog with an obsessive licking habit.          King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animalsTitch is a Jack Russell and Yorkie cross who leaves every surface covered in drool. When they bring in the experts, however, a poignant story emerges. His owner recently died and his obsessive behaviour is put down to extreme grief. Sob.It’s the more unusual animals that leave viewers scratching their heads, though.So we meet a tortoise called Dandelion with a habit of attacking people’s feet (it can move astonishingly quickly, for a tortoise), a sheep called Shaun who seems a tad psychotic, and an army of birds who have turned their homes into no-go zones.The series features not one but two hedgehogs. The owner of the first is concerned because he has been pulling out his own spines. Can a hedgehog self-harm? Possibly, but the vet believes it’s more likely caused by tiny mites.\u0027One in a million\u0027 photograph captures 60,000 swooping...The SECRET desert Tommies: Unseen images reveal for the...Share this articleEllie took Freddie along because she was at ‘the end of my tether’ with his eating.‘One of his big treats used to be those little Dreamies cat biscuits, with the soft insides, but the more he wanted the chicken nuggets, the more he rejected even these. We were worried that there was actually something wrong with him, physically, that he couldn’t manage hard food.’The problem — and this is a recurring theme with this jaw-dropping series — was more that Freddie had started to believe he was a human.Who can blame him, when it turns out Freddie also gets to watch TV and is spoiled with Christmas presents?Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and Will fell in love with him instantly.          Bird company: Angelica Hambis and her screeching cockatiel Rosie, who \u0027has an attitude problem\u0027‘He’s our baby,’ she says solemnly. ‘He knows I’m his mum and Will is his dad.’Freddie rules the household. ‘He’s a bit of a a,’ confirms Ellie. His cage sits in the living room, and every night (he’s nocturnal, so tends to get up about 10.30pm) he is allowed out to scurry around the sofa.‘He likes to hide behind the cushions,’ says Ellie.One is his cushion, to be fair. ‘It was his Christmas present. It’s got his face on it.’In his two-level cage, he has his own duvet and a hamster wheel on a mezzanine level. Needless to say, the experts have their work cut out with Freddie — and Ellie and Will. First stop is convincing them hedgehogs don’t necessarily see McDonald’s as a treat.‘It’s a common problem,’ says one of the show’s behavioural experts, Caroline Clark. ‘I’ve never come across a hedgehog liking chicken nuggets before, but owners can get into habits that aren’t necessarily in their pet’s long-term interest.‘The key is getting them to understand how the animal would behave in the wild.’Juliette Stevens, 50, attended the Embarrassing Pets clinic with her alpaca, Gus. Juliette has a herd at her Derbyshire farm, but Gus isn’t like the others.‘He thinks he’s human, always has,’ she confides. ‘It turns out his mother wasn’t able to feed him at birth and he was hand-reared. This means he actually thinks he’s a human. When I put him in the field with my other alpacas, he ignored them.’While Juliette is tempted to treat Gus as a human herself (‘he’s such an affectionate soul, when he’s in a good mood, that I can imagine letting him share my bedroom’), she’s also become concerned because of his bad behaviour.          Bannister vandalising parrot Rocco, who can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork‘If he isn’t getting enough attention, he will attack,’ she says. ‘He will have a go at people — hissing and spitting at them. And alpaca spit isn’t just spit. They regurgitate the contents of their stomach and hurl it at people. It’s quite disgusting.’Gus does this to the neighbours. He’s also attacked other alpacas. ‘If he was a human, he’d be a human with an Asbo,’ Juliette says, quite cheerily, in the circumstances.In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck. Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg.‘Charlotte was at a sleepover on a farm, and the egg started to hatch — and there was Charlie peeking out at her,’ explains her mum, Carli, 43.‘She came home and said: “Mum, I’ve got a duckling. Can we keep it?” I said we could —for a few weeks — but as he got bigger, he was adorable, and so he stayed for good. He followed Charlotte around. He wouldn’t leave her side. He thought she was his mummy.’This is a recognised phenomenon, says Caroline Clark. ‘It’s called imprinting.’          In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck Carli admits: ‘We call him the most pampered duck in Cheshire. We built him his own pond. He doesn’t really get to come into the house — ducks have no bowel control, we learned that the hard way.’Alas, ducks have instincts, and Caroline quickly assesses that Charlie is frustrated. While his instincts are telling him to forage for food, and mate when he pleases, his environment isn’t allowing that. Solution number one is to throw away his food bowl.‘In the wild they expend a lot of energy looking for their own food,’ explains Caroline. ‘The first step was to try to establish a version of that.’ Cue his family having fun ‘throwing lettuce and spinach around’, as Carli puts it.What about Charlie’s aggressive behaviour? He had taken to attacking visitors and — mortifyingly — getting amorous with his teddy. The family are gently advised that by providing him with his toy when he was badly behaved, they were rewarding his behaviour, and compounding the problem.‘Aggression is usually a symptom of another problem, and quite often it’s about an animal being frustrated,’ says Caroline. She likens her job to ‘putting a jigsaw together’. Some puzzles are more difficult to fathom than others. Everyone is baffled by the case of lovable collie Mac. Until recently he was a dream dog for owner Claire Curran, 38 — one who loved his walks. Then one day, something happened.          Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg (pictured: Charlotte and mother Carli Short)‘We still don’t know what. Maybe we will never know. He disappeared one day and was missing for about an hour. Someone found him and rang my number, as it was on his collar. When we got him back he was a nervous wreck,’ says Claire.Overnight, Mac had gone from being a confident dog to a collie with the collywobbles.‘He wouldn’t stop shaking. We couldn’t get him into the car, and when we did, we couldn’t get him out again. He’d slink behind me. He didn’t even want to go out in the garden. It was as if he’d been spooked by something.’They never did find out what happened to Mac — and rebuilding his confidence is painstaking.So is treating Rosie the cockatiel, whose owner, Angelica Hambis, 19, is in despair. Trainee jockey Angelica, who lives in Enfield, is a natural with animals. But Rosie is a law unto herself. ‘She has an attitude problem. It’s a girl thing. She doesn’t want to do what she doesn’t want to do.’Rosie’s issues — ear-splitting shrieking, and a refusal to be handled — seem to stem from trauma, though. Angelica got Rosie via an advert on the Preloved website when she was one, and was horrified to see the conditions she lived in. ‘It was in the middle of winter. It was so cold and she didn’t even have a blanket over her cage.’She installed Rosie in her own living room, near the TV and by a fish tank, so she had plenty to look at. Rosie has trust issues, though.‘She has some sort of phobia of my hands,’ Angelica reveals. ‘Every time I put them near her, she bites, hisses at me and runs away to the back of her cage.’ Another bird behaving badly is Rocco the parrot, who lives in Urmston, Manchester, with owner Mike Long, 54, but clearly still thinks he’s in the rainforest.Rocco, five, is Mike’s constant companion, and even accompanies him to the pub. ‘He walks up and down the bar. He loves all the attention,’ says Mike.Rocco, who has his own Twitter account, can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork.

But his screeching and biting has driven the family mad.So far, Rocco’s main victim has been the bannisters in the family home, which have fallen foul of his talons. But as Caroline explains: ‘In the wild, parrots would strip the bark off trees. The nearest equivalent is, unfortunately, the bannisters.’A lot of Rocco’s bad behaviour, however, is put down to a more human trait — attention seeking. ‘We were told that by responding to his hysterics, we were encouraging him to screech more,’ says Mike.

As a result, they develop a contemptuous view of everybody else.They are convinced they are above national and international laws and that they don’t need to abide by professional disclosure obligations.How telling that 64-year-old Ghosn has been witheringly described by his ex-wife (in a social media comment) as a ‘narcissist’ who has ‘a whole set of rules for others’ but who, she says, ‘follows none of his own rules, and practises nothing of what he preaches’.Blind to such character flaws, Mr Ghosn has been indulged by world governments and venerated for the way he has been a cheerleader for the global car industry.In addition to his role with Nissan, he is chairman and chief executive of Renault, the previously struggling company controlled by the French government. How ironic that Moneybags Ghosn, who is also boss of Mitsubishi Motors as part of a strategic alliance of the three car giants, has for many years been nicknamed by workers ‘Mr Cost-Cutter’.The British Government has also fallen under his spell.Two years ago, he sought assurances that Nissan would be protected from any ill-effects of Brexit. The firm has a factory in Sunderland, with 7,000 workers producing 50,000 cars a year. Having received a reassurance — in a deal the terms of which are still secret — Mr Ghosn said he believed the UK would ‘remain a competitive place to do business’.          Carlos Ghosn with second wife Carole at a premier at the Cannes Film Festival last year £14million of Nissan cash was used to buy homes in Paris,...Facebook is on track to post its longest losing streak ever...Nissan chairman is arrested after \u0027£34m pay swindle that saw...Share this articleThe sad truth is politicians and fellow businesses, as well as the car-buying public, have been hoodwinked by Mr Ghosn’s ‘triumphs’.They have sat on their hands and allowed car manufacturers to put money over morals.Ten years ago, bank chiefs ruthlessly employed amoral techniques to sell so-called sub-prime mortgages to the poor while pocketing multi-million bonuses for themselves. There followed a wave of other City scandals — from PPI to interest-rate fixing.Now, car industry bosses have joined bankers to become the latest liars and cheats.Most disgracefully, Volkswagen has been exposed for falsifying emissions test readings for its diesel cars by deliberately installing software in 11 million vehicles. The sole purpose was to deceive inspectors and dodge pollution laws.How utterly appalling that VW bosses thought they could get away with such flagrant and widescale dishonesty. While the British Government blithely promoted diesel cars as eco-friendly, thankfully America’s Environmental Protection Agency discovered the firm had doctored the testing of diesel engines so that they appeared to meet strict U.S. emissions standards.In fact, they were pumping 40 times the claimed test data when the cars were sold and on the road — and, as a result, the U.S. authorities ordered VW to pay a £2.2 billion fine.          Thye Tokyo Detention House in Katsushika in Tokyo where Carlos Ghosn was said to have been held after his arrestIt subsequently emerged that BMW and Daimler, owner of Mercedes, had engaged (though to a lesser extent) in similar behaviour. All big three German car-makers are under investigation by the European Commission. No wonder the country’s world-leading motor industry is in the dock.Of course, this isn’t the first time that car giants have been accused of sometimes unethical practices.In the Sixties, American consumer champion Ralph Nader published an excoriating attack on the U.S. motor industry entitled Unsafe At Any Speed. It recounted how General Motors had covered up design faults in its Chevrolet Corvair, saying the vehicle had unacceptable rollover risks which cost countless lives. Four decades on, it seems the industry has not learnt the error of its ways.Elon Musk has been humiliated after being charged with fraud by the U.S. financial regulator — eventually reaching a settlement that saw the regulator drop the charges in return for fines of £16 million ($20 million) from Tesla and Mr Musk. Only a few months previously, Musk had rebuked financial analysts, calling them ‘boring and bone-headed’ for questioning his firm’s performance. A victim of hubris, he has since been forced out by Tesla’s board.For his part, the fall from grace of Nissan’s Ghosn is one of the most spectacular setbacks in corporate history.As with past General Motors scandals and the VW emissions shame, the Nissan debacle is simply corporate greed.Indeed, the car industry is considered to be guilty of placing profits ahead of customers’ wellbeing and above other priorities such as trying to clean up the environment.As with the bankers whose greed triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, it seems we are witnessing in the behaviour of car bosses a shameless loss of a moral compass.Carlos Ghosn will be sacked tomorrow and, if he is found guilty, will hopefully disappear from the world stage. But his name will remain etched on a roll-call of dishonour as the latest businessman whose greed, impropriety and folly have caused untold damage to the national economies upon which the financial wellbeing of us all depends."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/15/4FAA378200000578-0-image-m-61_1535984350582.jpg","title":"England star Dele Alli filmed demanding upgraded fans slam pathetic bystander","story":"Two members of staff were seen talking with Dele Alli who was reportedly angry he could not get an upgrade as he hoped to celebrate England\u0027s win against CroatiaOn the clip, Alli is heard saying: \u0027Fourteen grand.

It manifests itself as actual light, illuminating their young faces, in his first painting of them together. They are romping through a bit of wild nature in about 1756, when Mary was around six years old and her younger sister Margaret was five. As Margaret reaches out to touch a white butterfly, her sister holds her hand warily, holding her back. They themselves make the shape of a butterfly, two wings of one fragile entity. In the National Portrait Gallery’s moving encounter with an 18th-century family, you see that butterfly grow, and see it broken.The story of Margaret and Mary is like Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, but with a tragic ending. Which is another way of saying it is a true story about women in the Georgian age. Yet it is not a sociological abstraction. It’s the intimate story of two sisters and their well-meaning father, and it has never before been told as clearly as by this lovely exhibition. The BBC should adapt it into a Sunday night drama. It’s got everything – frilly dresses, debonair youths, comic relatives – but instead of yet another posh house, it takes us into a world that’s joyously middle class.Meet “Scheming Jack”, the reprobate uncle of Mary and Margaret. His black hair looks greasy and unkempt. He turns his eyes away shiftily. He’s got stubble on his chin. In an age of powdered wigs he’s not even trying to keep up appearances. Gainsborough was the youngest of five children, and this is his least successful brother: always hatching doomed schemes and borrowing from his brothers and sisters. Yet they weren’t posh, either. The artist’s sister, Sarah Dupont, looks strong-willed in a mass of white lace: she plainly has aspirations – yet her husband Philip was a humble carpenter. He’s unpretentious and contented in Gainsborough’s relaxed portrait of his brother-in-law.Calling this show Gainsborough’s Family Album might suggest these portraits are modest. They are not. Gainsborough painted his family, for free, with the same brilliance he brought to the commissioned portraits of slave owners and countesses that made him wealthy. Born in Sudbury, Suffolk in 1727, the son of a failed provincial businessman – whom he portrays as a respectable gent – he would die, rich and famous, in his fine London home in 1788. Ever since, he has been slighted as a flatterer of the elite, by critics from William Blake to the Marxist John Berger, who caricatured Gainsborough as a simple celebrant of landed property.By turning our eyes to the portraits he did for his own pleasure and satisfaction, this exhibition reveals the greatness of Gainsborough. The people here are so alive, it’s as if the gallery had got some actors to dress up and wander about – so incredible is the lightness and animation of Gainsborough’s brush. It’s not just art history that gets turned upside down but British social history itself. When he opened a studio in Bath, he hung up portraits of himself and his wife, Margaret, to impress customers: yet they are not fancy flatteries. Both are rawly real in spite of their finery. They are icons of a society that was mobile, inidualist and modern.Gainsborough’s most modern quality is his desire to be a feminist dad. Is that pushing it? In an age of profound gender inequality, his paintings reveal an intense and sustained belief in his daughters’ potential. Its most radical expression was his desire for them to become artists – and to be able to make a living from it. In one of his grandest portraits of them, done in 1763 to 1764, he shows them as art students. They both have their portfolios while they pose among the casts of classical statuary they’ve been copying. Yet here, just as in the earlier portrait of them chasing a butterfly, their different personalities emerge. Mary looks intently back at her father, sitting with her art materials on her lap, a calm and sombre girl. Margaret, standing behind her, gazes dreamily into space. The curators think she’s looking at a cast. To me her eyes don’t seem fixed on anything at all.This was the start of the Romantic age, with its cult of “sensibility”, later mocked by Austen. Gainsborough’s portraits show Margaret becoming a woman of feeling. In a picture from about 1772 she looks up into the air, her expression ravished with poetic intensity. Gainsborough admires this in her because he himself was a closet Romantic who loved to paint dreamlike visions of the countryside. In his pastoral The Harvest Wagon, Mary and Margaret pose as rural labourers.By around 1777, Margaret is rapt in music as she plays a cello-like cittern, her face expressing the power of the music. Mary, too, is a Romantic figure in an experimental, almost impressionist painting of her decked in flowers and blurry paint, a poetic beauty. But could Gainsborough’s supportive vision of his daughters as Romantic rebels really be fulfilled in an age when marriage was supposed to be the only career open to women?In about 1774, he painted them together as aristocratic beauties, elevated, refined – and marriageable. It looks like surrender. Even Margaret keeps her eyes ahead and doesn’t daydream.Margaret was to marry a musician. The marriage failed, and she would eventually go insane. Mary looked after her for decades. Yet in the paintings here they come alive, as complex, unpredictable human beings. So do their quirky relatives. And so does Gainsborough himself. • At the National Portrait Gallery from 22 November until 3 February 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a06980f6936b216957a0a92f9a44447d00c339/0_0_3543_2362/master/3543.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=02b3c5c7454b077c8aacc686f0b66f8a 1320w","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book. We need Vimes now more than ever…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Marsh was subsequently arrested on suspicion of fraud and bailed, before resigning from the company.A spokesman for the FRC said it had moved quickly to consider whether the case required an investigation and that this was just the beginning of a process that could take up to two years to complete.“The important thing is to do a thorough job and get the right decisions. Investigators could have thousands of emails and different pieces of paper to examine, so it’s not something that can be done quickly,” he said.Once the FRC has completed the investigation, it will decide whether it has a case against Grant Thornton and Marsh to be presented to a tribunal, which could ultimately lead to a fine or, in the case of iniduals, banning them from practising as accountants.A spokesman for Grant Thornton said: “I can confirm we have received a letter from the Financial Reporting Council informing us of its decision to commence an investigation, and we will, of course, fully cooperate in this matter.”The investigation by Britain’s accountancy watchdog is the latest twist in the near demise of Patisserie Valerie chain. The firm was rescued from the brink of collapse by its chair Luke Johnson, who pumped in £20m of his own money after the discovery that it was nearly £10m in debt instead of having £28m in the bank, as it had last reported.Directors also revealed they had been unaware that Patisserie Holdings’ main trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, faced a winding-up petition from HMRC over a £1m unpaid tax bill. The cake shop and cafe group ultimately fought off the petition.Grant Thornton becomes the latest accountancy firm to come under the spotlight for its role in rubber-stamping the accounts of a company that has subsequently run into financial difficulty.KPMG is also under investigation by the FRC for its role as auditor of Carillion, the construction firm that collapsed in January under a mountain of debts and a host of unfinished public contracts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a9cf837971d05f5f3e6a2c621ee22b7e92c5cd/0_172_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d48c99d8af2c158a8f9e3e63012d551","title":"talktalk moves hq manchester salford joining media london exodus","story":"Firm plans to move ‘vast majority’ of it’s 500 staff to its Soapworks site in SalfordTalkTalk is to move its headquarters out of London, relocating hundreds of staff to Manchester as the exodus of major media and telecoms companies from the capital continues.TalkTalk, which opened a large offices at the Soapworks site in Salford last year to bring together its operations in the north-west, said it intends to relocate the “vast majority” of its estimated 500 London staff to its new headquarters next year.The move will be a fillip for the Manchester area, which is already home to significant parts of the BBC and ITV’s operations, as it came a close second missing out to Leeds as the location of Channel 4’s second “national” headquarters last month.TalkTalk said that the move would “simplify” the business, meaning it will make for significant cost savings. The company, which employs between 2,000 and 2,5000 staff across the UK, follows BT in identifying downgrading London as a major cost saving strategy. In May, BT said it would move out of its central London base at St Paul’s, where it has been headquartered since 1874 when the group was known as the General Post Office, as part of a wide-ranging restructuring to cut £1.5bn in costs.“As we further simplify the business, and focus on fewer priorities, we no longer need to be split across two main sites,” said Tristia Harrison, chief executive of TalkTalk. “Now is the right time to consolidate, making Salford the single main campus for the business. The vast majority of London roles will relocate to Salford in 2019. This will reduce operational complexity and allow us to become a more efficient, focused business, in turn supporting our long-term growth.”The company said it would start hiring for new posts in Salford, partly through an expansion of its graduate and apprenticeship programme, which it will need to do as many London-based staff will not want to relocate.TalkTalk also said its £1.5bn joint venture with Infracapital, part of M\u0026ampG Prudential, to lay full fibre networks to 3m homes in mid-sized town and cities would not be progressing. Instead, it has launched a new subsidiary, FibreNation, to undertake the roll-out and said it is in talks with potential partners, including Infracapital, to find the “appropriate long-term capital structure” for the business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4449565ea41a13389525b32e2c95194c422c9218/0_88_4235_2541/master/4235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30a746a404dccfca3299557075216a5a","title":"markets rattled us china trade brexit pound dow ftse business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as the White House accuses Beijing of ‘unfair’ trading practicesThe jump in UK borrowing last month may show that the government is, as promised, easing the chains of austerity (a little), as the economy slows.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains:Public borrowing in October 2018 was £1.6 billion higher than in October 2017, reflecting rapid growth in government spending last month but only a modest rise in tax receipts.This is consistent with indications from business surveys and the latest retail sales data that the economy slowed markedly as we moved into the autumn, due in large part to increased uncertainty around Brexit.The rise in UK borrowing last month will worry chancellor Philip Hammond, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics.This could be a worrying sign for the Chancellor. If this trend continues, the giveaways in the October Budget could see him breach his near-term fiscal targets. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the resulting economic slowdown would probably cause the public finances to deteriorate further. Admittedly, this could be offset to some extent by the UK not paying part of the financial settlement.Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, points out that Britain’s public finances depend on a good Brexit deal:“In the most recent Budget, the Chancellor pledged further investments into the NHS, roads and schools, and again loosened his target for deficit reduction. It looks like Hammond and May have bet on a positive outcome from Brexit, assuming a deal would be struck and pass parliament. The expectation that a Brexit ‘bounce’ would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes. With no clear support in Parliament for the deal, this is a high risk strategy. “We need to remember that if the Government is not able to get its deal with the EU through parliament then all such bets are off. In his budget speech, the Chancellor admitted as much. If the deal doesn’t get through then even if negotiations continue, it is more than likely that the budget will need to be revisited.”Economist Philip Shaw of Investec says the big picture is that UK public finance are improving, despite October’s stumble.The surprise jump in UK borrowing last month erodes some of the year-on-year improvement in the public finances:However, the government is still on track to borrow less in 2018-19 than in 2017-28.Britain’s deficit swelled to £8.8bn last month because the government’s income didn’t keep pace with spending.The Office for National Statistics explains:Much of this annual growth in central government receipts in October 2018 came from Value Added Tax (VAT), Income Tax and tobacco duties while interest and idend receipts (largely idend transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund) (BEAPFF) have fallen on October 2017.Newsflash: Britain’s ran up a much larger budget deficit than expected last month.The UK borrowed £8.8bn last month, £1.6bn more than in October 2017.This is the highest October borrowing for three years.On a happier note, Britain has borrowed £26.7bn in the current financial year-to-date, £11.2 billion less than in the same period in 2017. This is the lowest annual deficit at this stage of the year since 2005.More to follow...European stock markets are clawing their way back from yesterday’s selloff.The main indices are all higher, partly due to hopes of detente between Rome and Brussels over the Italian budget.There’s excitement in the bond markets this morning, following reports that Italy might compromise over its 2019 budget plans.According to the La Stampa newspaper, deputy PM Matteo Salvini could be open to revising its budget, by cutting planned spending on a new basic income scheme, and unwinding a pension reform.If so, that might help ward off a clash with the European Commission, which will give its judgment on the Italian budget later today (possibly 11am GMT).Despite Kevin Hassett’s claim that Trump’s tax policies are working, America’s trade deficit with China has actually grown this year. The gap hit $375bn in 2017, and is on rack to exceed this level in 2018 thanks to rollicking imports of China-made technology, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.Analysts at JP Morgan have warned that the US-China trade war will hurt economic growth.One of President Trump’s top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for “evicting China” from the World Trade Organisation (WTO).Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC that China had “misbehaved” as a member of the WTO, claiming:We never really envisioned that a country would enter the WTO and then behave the way that China has. It’s a new thing for the WTO to have a member that is misbehaving so much.He also claimed that the WTO was failing the US, as it takes so long to rule on trade disputes: “it takes five or six years and then the damage is done”.Hassett also claimed that Donald Trump’s hardball strategy on international trade is working. That’s questionable, when the US Trade Representative has ruled that China hasn’t change its policies....Hopes of a ceasefire in the US-China trade wars are fading today, after America launched a fresh salvo of criticism at Beijing.In a new report, US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer rules that China has not changed its “unfair” and “unreasonable” practices, despite pressure from America and the imposition of tariffs on $250bn of Chinese sales to the US.The move raises tensions ahead of the G20 meeting of world leaders later this month, where presidents Trump and Xi are expected to discuss the issue.Lighthizer’s comments came in an update of the U.S. Trade Representative’s “Section 301” investigation into China’s intellectual property and technology transfer policies.The USTR declared that China had not responded “constructively” to the initial section 301 reports.In particular, it’s unhappy that the Chinese government has persisted in using foreign investment restrictions to push US companies to share technology and intellectual property with Chinese entities.“We completed this update as part of this Administration’s strengthened monitoring and enforcement effort.This update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation.”Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Global markets are extremely edgy today, as investors fret about global growth prospects, the US-China trade war, Brexit, and Italy’s row with the EU over its budget plans.This followed a rough day in Europe, which saw Germany’s DAX hit a new 52-week low.The trading floor chatter is that the long bull market may be fizzling out.Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says:Another troubling start to the week in financial markets is further denting investor sentiment as we approach the open on Wednesday, with futures currently stable but vulnerable to another tumble.US tech stocks are once again leading the way, plunging on the back of a combination of inidual concerns – Apple iPhone sales for example – and general weaker risk appetite. The FAANG stocks extraordinary performance in the first half of the year has put them front and centre once the market turned and some now find themselves in negative territory for 2018, with others not far behind.While many would argue a correction has been on the cards for some time due to the growing list of risks to the outlook, be that rising US interest rates, Trump’s aggressive trade agenda, Brexit, Italy or one of a number of other headwinds, how bad it will get is difficult to say. We’re already near the October lows and in correction territory, even close to bear market in some cases such as the DAX, if this is just a corrective move, I would expect investors to start eyeing up some bargains soon.There’s lots in the economic calendar, particularly from America as they clear the decks before Thanksgiving. New home sales and durable goods orders will give a picture of the strength of the US economy.City traders will scrutinise the latest UK public finance figures to see if the government’s fiscal plans are on track. However, that will be overshadowed by Theresa May’s trip to Brussels to discuss the Brexit deal with Jean-Claude Juncker.In the eurozone, the Commission is expected to confirm that Italy’s 2019 budget isn’t acceptable.That paves the way for the EC to launch an excessive deficit procedure which could lead to Italy being fined (although it’s a long process)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ded8b64bfe4d8d78e315b0ae9fc39d983488236/0_750_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adfb5c7cf2b835b2585171c919bb507c","title":"is indias biggest ever urban redevelopment too good to be true bhendi bazaar","story":"A plan to transform Mumbai’s dilapidated Bhendi Bazaar district will also rehouse 3,200 families for free. So what’s the catch?by Marcello Rossi in MumbaiFarooq Patel has lived his entire life in Bhendi Bazaar in a tiny two-room apartment with no toilet that he inherited from his family. Soon, the 52-year-old embroidery worker will get a bigger, brand-new home with modern-day comforts such as air conditioning and induction burners. For free.Patel’s rented apartment is in one of southern Mumbai’s busiest market areas. A plan to rehouse all 3,200 families and 1,250 shops present in the district is part of what is touted as India’s largest ever urban redevelopment project.The plan involves razing 250 mostly dilapidated medium-rise housing structures and building 17 high-rise towers in their place. Thirteen will house existing commercial and residential tenants, who will be given ownership of their new apartments. The remaining four towers will be sold on the market to recoup costs. The project boasts that it will add greenery, wide roads, pavements, public spaces and glitzy shopping options to the local area.Patel’s future home will be in one of these gleaming skyscrapers. “Our next generation deserves better living conditions,” says Patel, who shares his minuscule flat with his wife and his teenage son.This 125-year-old market district is a holdover from colonial days. Originally built to accommodate male migrant labourers working in the city’s harbour, more recently it has attracted low-income families, drawn by state-controlled rents that have been frozen for years.Unable to afford anything else, they have stayed put, passing their tiny apartments down from generation to generation. As a result, landlords have been reluctant to spend money on maintenance, and the area has turned into one of the many slum-like settlements that can be found across this growing metropolis of 20 million. During flooding last August, the collapse of a century-old four-storey apartment block killed at least 34 people, including a 20-day-old girl.“We can’t live like this much longer,” says Quresh Mithaiwala, owner of a sweetmeat shop in the bustling neighbourhood. He thinks the revamp will be beneficial for retailers like him. “We are in the 21st century. Modernising will give us a great boost.”This ambitious project is the brainchild of the community’s former spiritual leader the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, who in 2009 made the drastic proposal to demolish the 6.6 hectare (16.5 acre) district, with the exception of its holy sites, and build anew.In a city where property prices are sky-high and challenges arising from land constraints are an everyday occurrence, it seemed an ambitious undertaking, but the proposal won approval from the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who made it a flagship smart city project in July 2015.Spearheading the $600m scheme is the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust, a charity whose coffers are filled with donations from the faithful rather than cash from corporations or investors. “The entire project is funded by the community. We’re not taking money from anyone,” says spokesman Murtaza Sadriwala.For the trust, the plan means more than moving people from their old setup to a new one. “Regardless of the caste, religion and sect, the project’s underlying objective is to uplift the lives of all the people living in the area and foster growth in all aspects – spiritual, intellectual, social and financial,” he says.“The community has a tremendous faith in its spiritual leaders,” he says. “Their influence has made it a lot easier for us to us to win their confidence and get their cooperation. We are actively engaging with and counselling the remaining tenants to move out of their dilapidated buildings which puts their lives and that of others in danger. Some are still refusing to move, but in the end they’ll be convinced.”The trust has so far managed to acquire 215 out of 250 buildings. Ninety have already been demolished, and more than 2,600 families and 600 businesses have been temporarily relocated nearby. The first residents and shopkeepers will be moved back next year when the first two clusters are ready. The project is scheduled for completion in 10 years.Could Bhendi Bazaar provide a blueprint solution for areas in other Indian cities and across the world struggling with overcrowding? Not everyone is convinced.Hugh Byrd, a professor of architecture at Lincoln University, doesn’t believe the project should be held up as an example. “The basic issue is whether this kind of development gives rise to more problems than it solves,” he says.This, explains Byrd, will make for more water and electricity consumption, and increase the production of waste. “In a city where repeated blackouts, water shortages and inadequate water and sewage treatment are already commonplace, this is likely to have a detrimental effect on the environment, further exacerbating health problems and climate change issues like vulnerability to flooding.”The single most critical issue, claims Byrd, will be the loss of the traditional socioeconomic activities that make up the character of Mumbai’s streets. “While the development will benefit inidual residents, it won’t do the same with businesses as the development plans indicate large retail spaces that risk losing its cultural character,” he says.For now, such concerns have little impact among residents such as 49-year-old Hussain Patnawala. After many years living in a 200 sq ft, low-ceilinged house, he cannot wait to get a new apartment and a new life. “Just the thought of not having to wake up early to use the communal lavatory and not having to pay rent is, well, unbelievable.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc61eea6c35fc39086d8a66b03dd1d9509b2c4e/0_0_1920_1440/master/1920.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f59faf78bf2806a8c588e67922fd2d8 880w","title":"britain go back european club history leave","story":"We’ve been in an onoff relationship for centuries. Even if we leave now, it won’t be foreverSometimes, when politics screams and tears its hair out, history can rush forward with a comfort blanket to wrap round its shoulders. It’s all right, it says, calm down, we have been here before. Britain has left Europe in a huff, and been drawn back in again. It has turned its back on Europe, and turned it back again almost as often. Today is just one of those times.The ancient province of Britannia was firmly part of the Roman empire for four centuries before that empire’s disintegration forced it to leave, in 410. Two centuries later, in 664, England voted at the Synod of Whitby to rejoin what was emphatically a European union, that of the Roman Catholic church, albeit with many a squabble under the likes of Henry II and King John. In 1534, Henry VIII spectacularly withdrew from that union, and Reformation England held itself aloof from Europe’s wars of religion throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.Then in 1704, England changed its mind and the Whigs plunged into the war of the Spanish succession against Louis XIV. The Tories reverted to detachment after Utrecht in 1713 and the Hanoverians left Europe well alone. In 1734 Walpole could boast to Queen Caroline that “50,000 men are slain in Europe this year, and not one an Englishman”. The Pitts would subsidise selected European allies but refused to fight with them, until Britain was drawn into the war against Napoleon. It then triumphed at Trafalgar and Waterloo, and a London square and a station were erected as memorials to the cause of a newly united Europe.At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 Britain helped found the Concert of Europe, to resolve the continent’s future conflicts peacefully. But it soon lost interest, to concentrate on trade with our old friend “the rest of the world” – or rather, the empire. It re-engaged for the Crimean war but disengaged to leave Bismarck his supremacy. Lord Salisbury declared a European policy to be one of “splendid isolation … drifting lazily downstream, occasionally putting out a boat-hook to avoid collision”.In the 20th century isolation met its nemesis: Britain was drawn into a great war it should have helped avoid. It then appeased France’s desire for revenge against Germany, and appeased its inevitable outcome, the rise of Hitler. When Baldwin in 1934 promised “freedom from adventures and commitments abroad, and no rearmament”, it was the climax of the age of leave. The outcome was a second world war.After that war, a new Europe, or half a Europe, saw Britain fully engaged in Nato. But it declined to join the Common Market in 1957, changed its mind six years later, and finally joined in 1973. Thatcher eulogised the Single European Act in 1986 as “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – with direct and unhindered access … to 300 million of the world’s wealthiest people.” She was ecstatic.Only at Maastricht in 1992 did the old hesitancy return, due largely to the EU’s drift to “ever closer union”. It upset the delicate equilibrium between the benefits of union and Britain’s sense of independence. John Major declined to join the eurozone and the EU social chapter. The slope was now downhill to two years ago, in 2016. That year, on my count, Britain left Europe for the ninth time in its history.The lessons of the past are glaringly obvious. The decision to leave is bound to be reversed – some time, somehow. Article 49 of the Lisbon treaty is clear: that any state can apply to rejoin. Public pressure to rejoin will be greater the “harder” Brexit proves to be. Erecting borders and barriers across the Channel is likely to prove so costly and inconvenient as to fuel the rejoiners’ cause.I think it more likely that the EU will degenerate into something else. The Concert of Europe broke down, as did the 1925 Locarno treaty, because of diminishing relevance amid the strands of Europe’s ever variable diplomacy. Of these, the most serious would be a descent into war. Nato remains somewhat hesitantly in place. In a time of military threat from Russia or elsewhere, it would be the European Union of necessity, and Britain is a full member of that.A more likely scenario has Europe itself changing and iding, as its economic space has to adjust to the changing politics, economies and cultures of its nations. The EU has clearly become too insensitive, too brittle, to survive for ever. All Europe’s great settlements – Westphalia, Utrecht, Vienna, Versailles, Yalta – have lasted no more than two generations.At present, the “populist” states of eastern Europe may mimic Britain and leave. The eurozone could grow increasingly unstable. The lesser tribes of Europe, oppressed by their local nation state, may default to greater separatism, like yesterday’s Slovaks and Slovenes and today’s Catalans, Corsicans and Scots. There can be no doubt that Europe at present is growing more fragmented, separating into its multifarious identities rather than cohering into a single European one.History suggests an EU that could evolve into a new Holy Roman Empire: a confederation of states, some big, some small, some little more than cities, like Monaco, San Marino and Liechtenstein. The old Holy Roman Empire was much derided by historians of the age of empires. Yet as its biographer, Peter Wilson, has written, its weakness was in truth its strength. It threatened no one. Its status as an essentially German empire guaranteed its members a local autonomy that was “multi-layered, from household, parish, community, territory, region to empire.”This empire lived, mostly at peace, for an astonishing 1,000 years, until smashed by Napoleon and Bismarck. It gave Europe among its greatest architects, artists, composers and philosophers. From such an example of graduated union I can see emerging one day a new form of union that Britain would be happy to rejoin.The “populist” states of eastern Europe might mimic Britain and leave. The eurozone might grow increasingly unstable. Others may default to greater separatism, like today’s Slovaks, Catalans, Corsicans and Scots. There will be many Europes for Britain to want to join. Europe has often felt the need of Britain, as in 1704, 1815, 1914 and 1939. But Britain too benefited from these engagements. Like it or not, globalisation means states cannot sensibly barricade themselves off from their neighbours. They must find reconciliation and trade. Geography has always been the tyrant of history. You can take Britain out of the EU as often as you like you can never take Britain out of Europe.• Simon Jenkins is a  columnist and the author of A Short History of Europe: from Pericles to Putin, published this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d8e8b46dc4eeebe7a966e02a394505f0f977ed/0_471_6704_4023/master/6704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18dfced50aa180442e06a1c1fd6c06f8","title":"britain west papua colonial occupation geoge monbiot","story":"The treatment of West Papua has been scandalously neglected by our politicians. Now they have a chance to atoneEvery colonial enterprise pretends to be inspired by something other than theft. The General Act of the Berlin Conference in 1885, under which the European powers carved Africa into formal colonial possessions, claimed that their purpose was “furthering the moral and material wellbeing of the native populations … and bringing home to them the blessings of civilisation”.Similar rhetoric has attended all such seizures. To save native people from their enslavement to the Devil, or the Arabs, or each other, they had to be forced into general servitude, while their land and natural wealth were transferred to more enlightened people from overseas. Preposterous as such propaganda may seem to most of us today, it was taken very seriously. In some quarters, it still is. Take the case, scandalously neglected in both journalism and politics, of West Papua.West Papua, the western half of New Guinea, is owned and run like a 19th-century colony. But in one respect its situation is even worse, as it is not formally recognised as such. Instead, it is treated by the United Nations and powerful countries – including the United States, Australia and the UK – as part of the national territory of Indonesia, the colonial power.Until 1962 the Netherlands, which was then the colonial master, had planned to oversee West Papua’s transition to independence. But the Dutch came under massive pressure from the US government, for whom south-east Asia was nothing but a series of counters to be deployed in its great game against the Soviet Union. It insisted that Indonesia be allowed to “administer” West Papua, as long as its people were permitted a referendum on independence by 1969.But there still had to be a referendum. So in 1969 Indonesian officials rounded up 1,026 men, took their families hostage and, under the guns of soldiers, told them to vote. An Indonesian general explained that if they made the wrong choice they would have their tongues ripped out. Swayed by such persuasive arguments, they voted unanimously for annexation. This process was officially known as the Act of Free Choice.There was, of course, no greater justification for this farce than for the treaties struck at gunpoint with native people in Africa, to fulfil the terms of the Berlin conference. A huge body of international law, including the agreement Indonesia had signed with the Netherlands, shows that questions of sovereignty cannot be decided this way, and that Indonesia has illegally annexed West Papua. But foreign governments affect to take the Act of Free Choice seriously.Among the most preposterous justifications were those put forward by British officials. “Naturally one sympathises with the natives, but colonialism is not always such a bad thing, indeed it is often beneficial,” one diplomat asserted. A note from the Foreign Office advised that it is “in the general interest to turn a blind eye”, while another official report stated that government policy was “to help sustain the present moderate regime in Indonesia” (the moderate regime being President Suharto’s government, which had already killed around 500,000 opponents).We’ve had 50 years of such excuses. Last year, foreign office minister Lord Ahmed told the House of Lords that the UK “retains its position on supporting the integrity of Indonesia”. But the principle of integrity does not apply, under international law, to occupied territories.Doubtless these positions are unconnected to the tremendous mineral wealth of West Papua, now being exploited by multinational corporations without the consent of its people. BP, for example, is working an £8bn natural gas field called Tangguh. Vast deposits of gold, copper and petroleum, timber from the world’s largest contiguous tract of rainforest outside the Amazon, and fertile soils on which palm oil can be grown have been seized from the indigenous people – assisted by the government’s continued imprisonment, torture, rape and murder of those who resist it. Despite the riches being extracted from their land, the Papuans suffer horrendous levels of childhood malnutrition, preventable disease and illiteracy.This month, after a year of being stonewalled, parliamentary supporters of West Papuan independence (who include Jeremy Corbyn) have at last been allowed to present this petition to the Foreign Office. Because the leader of the independence movement, Benny Wenda, lives in this country and because the UK, with its seat on the UN security council, has been instrumental in justifying the seizure of their land, using the age-old excuses for colonial rule, the attempt at international recognition begins here. The question is: will the government listen, or will it continue to pretend, as it did in 1885, that the theft of a nation is a sacred duty?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80386b93c147be3475dc8385d60bfe9fbb1e0229/143_318_830_498/master/830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a5c189f5bc5595d37dde8144792661","title":"christian parent legal action heavers farm school pride parade","story":"Izoduwa Adhedo accuses south London primary of trying to ‘indoctrinate’ her son against her beliefsA London primary school is facing the prospect of legal action after a Christian parent formally complained about a “Proud to be Me” event she claims promoted LGBT lifestyles.Heavers Farm school in South Norwood has strongly denied that it organised a “gay pride parade” earlier this year, but Izoduwa Adhedo claims her son was forced to take part “in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs”.Adhedo, whose son has since been withdrawn from the school, was due to meet school governors on Tuesday evening to press a formal complaintShe is being supported by Christian Concern, a conservative evangelical organisation whose legal arm takes up cases of perceived religious discrimination. A spokesperson said the Adhedo family was looking at potential legal action if the complaint was not resolved.The complaint centres on an event organised by the school in June, in which pupils were encouraged to march with banners highlighting what made them proud to be themselves.In a message to parents, the school said: “At this parade each child will be celebrating what makes them proud of themselves and their family. We encourage you to talk to your children about what they will be celebrating.”Susan Papas, the headteacher, told the : “Equality is a thread that goes through our curriculum. We’ve done projects on black history month, disability and women’s history.“At the end of the year we decided to do something on anti-homophobia as part of Pride month, taking the idea that people and families can be different but everyone can be proud. There were some objections but they were outweighed by support.”She declined to comment on Adhedo’s complaint, saying she could not discuss inidual pupils or their families.In a statement, Adhedo said: “After I complained about my young child being forced to take place in an event that goes against our Christian beliefs, the school’s attitude towards me changed completely. I know other parents who are afraid to speak up because of how the school has treated me.“It was like being bullied. They stopped treating me like any other parent but were antagonistic towards me. I believe that they retaliated against me by unreasonably excluding me from the premises, victimising my child and not taking my safeguarding concerns seriously.“I wasn’t even trying to stop the Pride event. I just wanted my child to receive an education, rather than indoctrination.”According to Christian Concern, Adhedo withdrew her son from the school last month after he was put in detention for three hours. The school insisted its maximum detention was one hour, in line with its behaviour policy.Roger Kiska of Christian Concern said: “It is inappropriate for children to be proselytised on this issue. The school has crossed a line.”Under the Human Rights Act, schools were obliged to respect the rights of parents’ religious and philosophical convictions in providing education, he added.According to the school’s policy published on its website, “issues such as bullying, racism, homophobia, sexism and prejudice are dealt with in lessons and assemblies. Classes visit places of worship that are important to different faiths.“Special celebration events are held and parents and visitors from different cultures, faiths or religions share their beliefs, customs, food and knowledge all greatly enhancing learning within the schools.”Earlier this year, the Christian Legal Centre, an organisation linked to Christian Concern, took up the case of Alfie Evans, a terminally ill infant whose parents contested medical advice to turn off his ventilator.It is also representing a Christian couple accused of discriminating against LGBT guests at their Welsh guest house, and others “who have suffered discrimination and challenges because of their desire to live and work according to biblical beliefs”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e56f7f1cd1ff461615bceaa671d1523534d18b/302_109_1618_971/master/1618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7179714eaebadac3dad52e268af023","title":"ten everyday ways drivers make cyclists feel unsafe","story":"From speeding and light jumping to parking in bike lanes and passing too close, driver behaviour is one of the main deterrents to widespread cyclingWhat prevents significantly more people in the UK from riding bikes for everyday transport? The primary answer is simple: a lack of safe infrastructure.If cyclists are expected to share the roads with a tonne or so of speeding metal then, global experience shows, you won’t get more than a certain, small percentage of the population doing it, predominantly the young and gung ho.But the reasons behind this are more nuanced than they might seem. Yes, actual danger is a significant issue. But in the UK, cycling is both less safe than it could be and also significantly more safe than most people believe, with an average of a million miles ridden per serious injury or death.The problem is it feels unsafe. A pioneering 2015 study found frightening incidents, even if they did not actually cause harm, were a routine experience for UK riders. This is a particular issue for novice cyclists, many of whom are swiftly put off their new mode of transport.Although safe cycling infrastructure can prevent the great majority of such experiences, it’s also worth stressing that near-misses are not necessarily intrinsic to the current road system. Many happen because of poor choices, carelessness and reckless actions by other road users, overwhelmingly drivers and to a lesser extent riders of motorbikes and mopeds.I decided to try and create some sort taxonomy of these behaviours by borrowing a cycle camera, riding my usual route to and from work in London, and recording what happened. The highlights, if you can call them that, can be seen in the video above.The vast majority of the clips come from the last few weeks, though a couple were from earlier. Some of the dates shown in the bottom of the screen are incorrect as it took me a while before I remembered to set it properly.The borrowed camera was a Fly12, an excellent combined front camera and light made by Australian company Cycliq. I also briefly used their rear-view model, called the Fly6, which you see in a couple of the clips.Before I list the behaviours, one final point is worth noting: this video is almost certainly an understatement of the extent of frightening behaviour on most UK roads.One of the most scary, and regular, experiences is excess driver speed. All my clips come from central London, where congestion keeps average speeds low. Ride in a less built-up area and you will routinely be overtaken by cars doing 40mph or much more, even in 30mph limits. This is no fun.Also, almost all the riding took place on my carefully-plotted route into work, which mainly comprises side roads. It’s no surprise that several of the worst incidents I chronicled come from a single spot – the perennially feral roundabout on the south side of Lambeth Bridge.After all that, here is my list of 10 driver behaviours that routinely intimidate and frighten cyclists. Watch the video for my examples, and then tell us which ones annoy or worry you the most.No fun in a car, terrifying if you’re on a bike. It’s amazing how often some drivers think it’s OK to drive an inch behind your rear wheel. The example in the video was a particularly bad one – the driver concerned seemed to think I should have been in the bus lane, even though it was occupied further down, and tried to more or less shove me off the road.A hugely common experience, generally carried out by drivers who feel compelled to overtake no matter what the risks. Obviously, fast close passes are the most scary, but they are always a shock, as shown by the startled yelp I generally give in the examples above.Another routine occurrence, often requiring you to slam on the brakes. The example above features a motorbike rider, who tailgated me down a narrow 20mph street where it was clearly unsafe to overtake, beeping the horn, before pulling across me to turn, seemingly as much for punishment as convenience. Don’t turn up the volume too loud at work, as I’m afraid I swore.This is ubiquitous, and as mentioned above, is much more of a problem on quieter roads. Even in London at less congested times, for example during the night, speeding is the norm. The example above shows that even when it’s a moped, an over-fast overtake can be startling.It is amazing how many drivers think cycle lanes are some form of emergency parking. The video snippet above features a sight I see several times a week – a 24-hour bike lane near where I live blocked by someone who has decided to pop into the adjoining shop, forcing riders to pull out into the centre of a busy road while going up a hill.This seems linked to some drivers’ belief that cyclists should be squeezed into the gutter, and that if they’re not it’s fine to edge into the rider’s lane to try and nudge them over. In the example above, I was deliberately in the centre of the lane on the roundabout in question, as I was turning right immediately afterwards.Every cyclist knows this one: as the road narrows, usually for a pedestrian traffic island, someone in a vehicle tries to overtake at the last minute, obliging the cyclist to brake heavily to avoid being forced into the kerb, or worse.Used in many cities, these painted boxes at the front of traffic lights are designed to allow cyclists to set off from a green light in full view of others, not trapped among a stream of vehicles. Sadly, quite a few drivers ignore this, forcing cyclists either to wait behind or edge even further ahead.There is much popular fuss about this habit among some cyclists. But watch most junctions carefully and you’ll see just as many drivers ignoring the red. This is often done at speed – many accelerate across as the lights change – and causes many more deaths and injuries. As ever, it’s all about the physics.It’s common as a cyclist to have vehicles occupying space which isn’t strictly theirs. The example in the video shows one of the many ways the residential street shown is unpleasant to ride on – right-turning drivers cutting the corner, veering heavily into the opposite lane. If you’re coming the other way in a car this can be unsettling. Do so on a bike and it’s downright scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20478d72d52bbc623cdfacb59bc7bd34c11f8a6f/0_0_5642_3387/master/5642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84c17860c5cda43b3f98c3831b66f32","title":"10 best jumpers for men in pictures","story":"Feeling the chill?

But that was before Netflix decided that it wants Oscars.For a film to be eligible for entry in the annual Academy Awards in the US it must have played in a Los Angeles county cinema, for paid admission, for a minimum of seven consecutive days. Roma is released on Wednesday in LA, New York and Mexico, before opening in London on 29 November and going worldwide on Netflix on 14 December.However, Cuarón’s film will get just three weeks in US cinemas – the other two will disappear after only a week apiece – as Netflix fulfils the minimum requirements.“At the moment Netflix is perhaps not quite gaming the system but it is taking advantage of rules for entry suggesting the situation is benefiting Netflix more than the Oscars,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at media consultancy Ampere. “They are meeting the minimum requirements, the letter of the law if not perhaps the spirit.”The Oscars rules aside, cinema owners have agreed with Hollywood studios that films run exclusively in US theatres for 90-days before moving to other platforms. The subscription video-on-demand sector, where Netflix operates, has traditionally been well down the pecking order. There are similar agreements in most other countries, but with different exclusivity periods.Gravity director Cuarón’s film will be shown on more than 100 screens globally. It means Roma will probably top Netflix’s biggest cinema release to date, 22 July, a Paul Greengrass drama about the Anders Breivik attack in Norway. But it is nowhere near the level of a mass-market Hollywood release: the US has more than 40,000 screens and the UK over 4,000.“Our position is that UK cinema operators would welcome anyone who brings quality film content to the market,” said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. “However, most cinema operators would expect in doing that those bringing those films in would observe certain industry norms around a significant period of theatrical exclusivity. We would hope in due course to persuade Netflix it is in their best interest too.”It has long been known that winning awards sells tickets – or in Netflix’s case pulls in new subscribers – but for the streaming giant cracking the Oscars is also about completing its ascendancy as the digital upstart that broke the established Hollywood model.It has already conquered TV. In September, Netflix broke HBO’s 17-year record for the most Emmy nominations, 108, by amassing 112. It tied with the Game of Thrones maker for most wins, 23 each, for shows including The Crown, Black Mirror and Godless.To date, Netflix has achieved 14 Oscar nominations with two wins: White Helmets, a 40-minute documentary on volunteer rescue workers in Syria and Icarus, a feature length documentary on the Russian sports doping scandal. Amazon, however, became the first streaming company to gain a best picture Oscar nomination for last year’s Manchester by the Sea, which won Casey Affleck best actor and was given a wide cinema release.“This is a malleable situation that is still being figured out by both sides,” says Paul Dergarabedian, analyst at media consultancy Comscore. “However, the conundrum that Netflix faces is that while they covet Oscar consideration, their small screen distribution model eschews the movie theatre release convention. Amazon Studios has shown there are ways to bridge the gap while still being true to the streaming service mission”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4921e60dd01d4cc0b88a9ac72c0c811fa1e6394/180_69_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94289a9ff9227123bef554bb8960346e","title":"scotland israel nationa league match report","story":"That the Nations League carries greater significance than the friendly matches it replaced hardly requires debate. The sense that this event became wholly relevant for the future and reputation of Alex McLeish was also plain to see. The same arguably applies to his paymasters at the Scottish FA.McLeish can enjoy a last laugh over his many detractors. Scotland’s progression from the group stage at the expense of Albania and Israel may not look momentous, but in context it is wholly important to the manager. The governing body has also been afforded a valuable cash boost courtesy of his men winning group C.This victory over Israel was ultimately merited, if belatedly panic-ridden. In an era where Scotland and international success have become such strangers, that is worthy of celebration. So, too, was James Forrest’s superb hat-trick. “I’m so proud of the guys, we answered a lot of questions,” McLeish said. “Criticism is fine because it makes you want to do better. The goal was to win, we did that. The lads played to a very high level.”Scotland’s canter in Albania on Saturdaynight had offered impetus to a regime which had been thoroughly unconvincing until that point. That 4-0 success clearly was not sufficient to reinvigorate the Scotland support, however. Tens of thousands of empty seats were once again a dismal feature at Hampden. Perhaps the national mood will change now.Scotland’s lame start was oh so curious. In a match where only victory was an acceptable outcome and the starting XI was the same as three days earlier, they opened up as if sleepwalking. The vim and vigour so evident at the weekend – albeit against a dreadful side – had vanished. And Israel capitalised on the tepid approach to claim an early advantage.League A, Group 1: Germany 2-2 NetherlandsB1: Czech Republic 1-0 SlovakiaB4: Denmark 0-0\u0026nbspRepublic of IrelandC3: Cyprus 0-2 Norway, Bulgaria 1-1 SloveniaD1: Georgia 2-1 Kazakhstan, Andorra 0-0 LatviaD4: FYR Macedonia 4-0 Gibraltar, Liechtenstein 2-2 ArmeniaLeague BPromoted: Ukraine, Sweden, Bosnia-Herzegovina, DenmarkRelegated: Slovakia, Turkey, N Ireland, Rep of IrelandIt was bad enough for McLeish that Beram Kayal was given one opportunity to shoot from 25 yards, such was the lack of pressure on the ball from Scotland’s defence or midfield. That the former Celtic midfielder took a touch before curling the ball beyond Allan McGregor was inexplicable from Scotland’s point of view. The finish itself was first class but Kayal was visibly caught between wild celebration and not believing the generosity of his opponents.If Scotland were to claw themselves back into the match – and it took them more than 20 minutes to fashion an opportunity – the identity of the likely protagonist was hardly a mystery. Forrest, fresh from two goals in Albania, seized upon the rebound from a Stuart Armstrong shot to slam the ball home.Better was to come for McLeish. A swift counterattack, in which Ryan Christie performed brilliantly, resulted in Forrest being played in 18 yards from goal. The Celtic winger again made no mistake, thereby completing a quick turnaround which had looked so improbable.The second half’s early minutes highlighted Scotland’s problem. Israel’s defence was considerably more ropy than robust, yet they carried a threat when breaking. Scotland’s challenge boiled down to chasing a third or believing a one-goal lead would suffice.Ryan Fraser was the architect of Scotland’s third goal with a jink into the area from the left flank. The Bournemouth player passed to the man of the moment, who finished low beyond Ariel Harush. It seemed vaguely unfair to Forrest that Robert Snodgrass had claimed a hat-trick for Scotland in Malta just two years ago.The prospect of a nerveless finish was shattered by Eran Zahavi and the Scots’ own incompetence. In a scene similar to Israel’s opener, when closing down looked an alien concept, they allowed Zahavi more time and space than was sensible, this time on the edge of the area, and he lashed a drive into the net, thereby affording Israel unlikely hope.One more chance duly arrived, McGregor saving expertly from Tomer Hemed. “We were written off and came through it,” McLeish added. It was an entirely fair point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45176d3c51f705a6391d4735af861ab5e1bbc79c/0_158_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=687ec611e9c27a16f1626408b455ecbf","title":"football stadiums and their views of famous landmarks","story":"Plus: teams playing in a national league based furthest from the mainland, impactful ballpeople and more multi-kit combinations.

Incidentally, the castle is well worth a visit if you ever find yourself in the city.”Here’s Harry Lingard. “I give you the relatively new Singapore national stadium which is open at one end,” he emails. “Through the gap you can see the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the ‘Eiffel Tower’ of the east.”Several of you also flagged up Toronto FC’s BMO Field, from where the CN Tower can still be seen. While the Space Needle can be seen during Seattle Sounders games from parts of CenturyLink Field. And then, here are some more of your suggestions on Twitter:Any more for any more? You know where to email or tweet.“Las Palmas and Tenerife are based thousands of miles from mainland Spain, yet play in the Spanish isions. Are there any other examples?” asks Jon Pople.Let’s hop across the border to Portugal and this example from Nuno Peixeiro. “Santa Clara (Clube Desportivo Santa Clara) is based in the Azores and plays in the Portuguese 1st Division,” writes Nuno. “There are teams in the westernmost islands of the Açores, but they never made it to the First Division. That makes them some 1,500km (932 miles) from the mainland. You could try to cheat and not have a sea between the mainland and the ‘annex’, and go with FK Baltika Kalingrad but that’s only some 500km from the rest of Russia.”Andrew Law has an example from Australasia. “It might be slightly stretching the definition but New Zealand side Wellington Phoenix of the A League are based 1,383 miles (2,226km) from Sydney, their closest away trip. As an added bonus they are also the only club to play their domestic football in a league that belongs to a different confederation to their national team after Australia moved to the AFC in 2006.”Unsurprisingly the vast landscape of America offers another contender. “I nominate Team Hawaii,” writes Boris Cule. “They participated in the NASL 1977 league and were based in Honolulu, nearly 2,400km from the mainland.”Boris has an even more extreme example. “If we include national cups, I don’t think anyone can beat teams from New Caledonia taking part in the French Cup (New Caledonia is over 10,000 miles away from mainland France). Teams from Tahiti, which is not much closer, also take part, as do teams from French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion and Mayotte.In last week’s Knowledge, we looked at teams with the most kit combinations in a single season. And there are plenty more kits where they came from.“In 1993-94,” writes Dan Teece, “my beloved Sheffield Wednesday wore eight different shirt, shorts and socks combinations. That included four different away, one of which was Bolton’s. Full details can be found here.”Dirk Maas reports that Feyenoord “wore nine different shirts and 10 different kit combinations in 1991-92”. And finally, inevitably, we have Manchester United during their golden age of shirtswappery.“I remember reading about a football pitch in South America which had a large tree in an awkward position near the centre of the pitch,” wrote John Malcolm in 2007. “Are there any other examples of such environmentally friendly pitches?”Unfortunately we weren’t able to track down John’s tree, but a couple of St Albans City fans did email in to give us details of the large oak that once dominated the main terrace at their Clarence Park ground. Due to its age, the tree was legally protected, and couldn’t be taken down as long as it was healthy.“It used to get a huge cheer if any opposing player managed to hit it with a wayward strike,” recalled Fraser Mann, but supporters were less enthused when it prevented the club from getting promoted in 1992-93. According to the club’s website: “During a second spell in charge, John Mitchell took the Saints to the (Isthmian League) Premier Division runners up position in 1992-93 only to be denied promotion to the Conference at that time due to a 140-year old oak tree standing within the terrace behind one of the goals.

Photographs by  Tom JenkinsThe men employed on building the 40,000-seat al-Rayyan football stadium were having their lunch, in the model accommodation camp of the “supreme committee” organising the 2022 World Cup, when I talked with them about their lives as migrant workers in the wealthiest country on earth. They had come from Ghana, where they said adverts about construction jobs in Qatar were broadcast on the radio, and about 300 of them had taken the opportunity. All four had paid agents, an exploitation that is officially outlawed but is endemic in the recruitment of millions of people from poorer countries to work all over the oil and gas-rich Gulf.“The agent said to me: ‘Qatar is the richest country in the world you can Google it,’” one man told me. “He said we would earn a ‘huge salary’. But when we came here, we found it was the opposite.”Al-Rayyan is one of seven dazzling stadiums being built around the Qatari capital, Doha, in addition to the reconfiguring of the sole pre-existing World Cup venue, Khalifa International, which was completed last year. The total cost is between $8bn and $10bn, according to the supreme committee’s general secretary, Hassan al-Thawadi. Representatives of the supreme committee and their contractors walked us on a tour of al-Rayyan, being built to Fifa’s highest specifications. In heat and glare, 10 men from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the most common countries of origin for Qatar’s migrant workers, were neatly cementing square vents beneath every seat, in time for a tournament due to begin in exactly four years’ time – on 21 November 2022.At the camp, accommodating 4,500 men, they guided us around the improved facilities adopted widely to replace dire, overcrowded, unsanitary dumps that still plague the country. Official government standards still allow four workers to be accommodated in one room but bunk beds are outlawed. Food is cooked and supplied to good nutritional standards there is a medical centre on site, plus a gym, a football pitch and a computer room with free internet to help the men, all away from their families, communicate with home. There is also a free laundry service – “Just like a hotel,” one of our guides said.So when I finally sat down to talk to the workers, I was almost ready for them to say they could hardly be happier. Aged between 28 and 38, all married with at least one child, they acknowledged that the camp was decent they had Ghanaian friends in other camps which were dirty, and had no food or amenities. Then they started to talk about the pay.“It is hard to be away for so long,” one said. “Sometimes the family want to have you in their midst – and you may not have money to send them. We were supposed to earn something big – but we earn small.”Asked how much, one of them opened his eyes wide in exasperation, and said: “650 a month basic salary.”For building one of the prestige stadiums designed so Qatar can dazzle the world in 2022, eight hours a day, six days a week, this is £140: a little under £35 per week £5 per day.Like all the migrants working in Qatar, the money they send home is not extra it is primary income to support their families. The Ghanaians said they still have expenses in Qatar, although food and accommodation is taken care of, and the money is not enough.One man, 38, who said he had two sons, aged 10 and two, explained: “Our system in Ghana is the extended family. When anybody needs help, they come to you. They know we have travelled to Qatar and ask us for money, but we don’t have it. I do not have enough to feed my family. The money is not what we expected to get. We think about this all the time.”They said they did not believe that raising a grievance would change anything. A 29-year-old man said: “We don’t have help from anywhere, we have to support and encourage ourselves every day. Otherwise what will you do: kill yourself?”The supreme committee always argued that the scrutiny arising from the success, in 2010, of the bid for 2022 could be a catalyst for reform. This tournament is, inescapably, a World Cup of inequality, hosted by the per capita wealthiest country, built by men from the poorest.In October 2017, the government headed off an impending formal commission of inquiry into the conditions of its migrant workers by the UN agency the International Labour Organisation, by agreeing to work with the ILO on a programme of reforms. In a statement from Thamer al-Thani, Qatar’s media attache in the UK, the government said it was “committed to working with our international partners, including the ILO, to improve the rights and living conditions of our guest workers. Qatar welcomes all constructive feedback of our labour system and we have never shied away from the idea that further reform is required.”A major breakthrough was hailed in September with the abolition for most workers – although not domestic staff – of the loathed exit permit, which prevented people at the end of contracts returning home without their employers’ permission.Houtan Homayounpour, head of the ILO’s Qatar project office, describes that as a beneficial change, and he lists other results: settlement committees for workers’ disputes, legal protections for domestic workers, and a commitment to ending the notorious “kafala” system, which ties workers to a single, sponsoring employer.The supreme committee has itself implemented a system for reimbursing workers some of the recruitment fees they paid to agents. Mahmoud Qutub, executive director of workers’ welfare, told us they expect to pay 89m rials, £19m, to 39,000 workers over the next three years, an average of £487 each.“Actions speak louder than words real changes have been made,” Homayounpour said. “Is it perfect? No. The government admits that and there is much more to do. There is genuine progress but challenges remain, which we are working on.”The government has committed itself to introducing a minimum wage, and while research continues into a recommended level, a temporary figure has been agreed. But it is only 750 rials a month – £160, a little under £40 a week.The supreme committee said its contractors at al-Rayyan were instructed in September to pay the advisory minimum wage of 750 per month to all employees. They said they investigated the pay of the Ghanaian men and did find one of them being paid 650. “This has now been rectified,” a spokesman said.The senior figures we talked to seemed to struggle to see injustice in the painfully low pay, saying it was much more than people would earn in their home countries. The “remittance” of money by people working in wealthier countries to low- and middle-income countries is indeed a global phenomenon in 2017, the World Bank has reported, $466bn was remitted, with India the biggest recipient, of $69bn.One expert in Doha said that when trying to understand the resilience of so many migrant workers in tough conditions, it is important to remember the hardships from which they have escaped. “In their home countries, many of these people live in incredibly poor, subsistence conditions,” he said. “There are no jobs, no infrastructure, no roads or drinkable water in some areas, and labour exploitation. We are seeking to address important issues, but they see their ability to work in Qatar and send money home as a huge advance.”The government is keen to showcase the strides it has made to improve welfare, and it organised access to two camps that meet its standards. The first, up a desolate road at al-Khor to the north of Doha, past a sandy stretch pockmarked with twisted remains of metal sheds, accommodates 3,000 men working for the French-Qatari construction joint venture, QDVC. The company’s staff and government inspectors proudly showed us the bare rooms shared by four men, separate clean toilets and showers, large gym and internet room – and while we could appreciate the physical basics being provided, we found the place painfully bleak.The government’s policy to address the large problems with inadequate accommodation, often run by smaller companies, they said, has been to commission “Labour City”, a vast, purpose-built complex behind high walls and railings, opened in 2015 to accommodate 100,000. In total five camps are planned, to move up to 600,000 to the solid buildings and better facilities, which incorporate clean toilets and showers, catered food, communal green spaces, a large mosque and places of worship for other religions, medical and recreational facilities. Famously next door is Asian Town with its mall and restaurants for workers, and a 15,000-seat cricket stadium and an amphitheatre for outdoor events.In a corporate presentation my guides put on before the tour, Labour City was said to be born of “the wise vision of the state of Qatar”. The language was telling, though: the presentation said the camp was built to provide a “proper environment” for “this category of society”.In the internet room upstairs in one of the blocks, a lone man was watching YouTube clips from home, earphones on. He was 38, he said, from a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. He had been in Qatar for seven years. He was married with three children, aged 12, eight and five. “Before, I stayed in different camps, in wooden cabins. Now it is better, safer, to be in a concrete building. And it is good to be near the shops and supermarket, because some camps were far from town.”Asked how it felt to be so far from his family, he said: “I miss them. When I feel too much pain, I call them. But I am earning enough money to support my family and relatives. So I am feeling relaxed.”To meet workers outside the designated camps, a man with local knowledge took me to a street corner in the Msheireb area of downtown Doha. Round the corner from the Corniche strip of beach, and the Souq Waqif complex of shops and restaurants, the area turns suddenly into a rundown street transplanted from Bangladesh. My interpreter walked into the crowd and asked two young men how life was for them. He explained loudly that I was from a newspaper, that newspapers had reported the oppression of the exit permit, the government had read the coverage, and the exit permit had been abolished, so they should talk to me in the hope their lives might change.Within minutes, a huge crowd of men had gathered, all telling stories of despair. Their experiences made life in the camps seem secure, enviable by comparison.“People here are not working,” one man said. “Or they are working but not being paid. There is no work, or very low pay.”They had all paid agents for visas, one or two had purported sponsors that proved to be a mirage one man unfolded a scrap of paper with his sponsor’s name on it, a company he had never been able to find.“The agents said Qatar is a very rich country, with the 2022 World Cup there you can earn good money,” one Bangladeshi man, 28, told me. “But here when you work, the company does not pay you.”They had found bits of work on construction projects, they said, as electricians, plumbers, firefighters, from subcontractors, supply companies, who did not pay them or folded. One man just stood and shook his head, repeating “supply companies” over and over again. He was 38, he said, with a wife and 10-year-old daughter in Bangladesh, and was in agony because he could not send money home and did not have the fees to keep his daughter in school. His wife criticised him for going to Qatar, because rickshaw drivers in his village were making money to support their families.Another young man, 26, shouted that he did not have money even to eat: “No rice, no vegetables, no chicken,” he said. “Only chapati.”His eyes had a look of pleading. I asked how long he had gone without proper food.“Eight months,” he replied.We promised I would report these stories, and that the government and the supreme committee organising the 2022 World Cup would read the coverage. Within five minutes my interpreter and I were driving along the Corniche, past the formidable, floodlit Emiri Diwan, Qatar’s parliament building. Soon we were up in the West Bay, among the towers, hotels and restaurants where fans will enjoy exquisite service in 2022, amid the signs of the supreme committee, with their promise for the World Cup to “Deliver Amazing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095b569268a8729652276ce34233290874e7182b/47_86_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=172e2850f402a5b24fc1ca41fdb8505a","title":"football league blog managers sackings","story":"A season barely three months old has already chewed up and spat out almost an entire matchday squad of managers. Fifteen have left posts in the Football League since August, six more than at this stage last season. John Askey’s exit at Shrewsbury Town was especially dispiriting, compounding a miserable hat-trick of sackings for a triangle of coaches who moved up the managerial ladder having directly replaced one another. Harry Kewell’s exit from Notts County after 73 days was the latest reminder of the remorselessness.Paul Hurst, the catalyst for the aforementioned merry-go-round, was presumably not alone in thinking that he was broadening his palette and moving on to bigger and better things when he left Shrewsbury for the Ipswich Town job in May. It is impossible to sugarcoat results – Askey, Hurst and Mark Yates (at Askey’s previous club, Macclesfield Town) mustered five league wins between them in 43 games – but such sackings are indicative of a problem facing British coaches aiming to better themselves.Hurst is among the countless young managers to have namechecked Eddie Howe and Sean Dyche as beacons of hope, but attempting to bridge that gap is a thankless task, one seemingly getting harder. At the turn of the year Hurst acknowledged that winning promotion to the Premier League was the best route to a top-flight job but he would struggle to command a Championship job now, as would Askey and Yates in League One and League Two respectively. It is so easy to question a manager’s ambition but, quite simply, the grass is not always greener.It is not all doom and gloom, with a few anomalies leading the way. Chris Wilder has done a magnificent job since taking over at Sheffield United two years ago, but Dean Smith is perhaps the most salient example of leaving behind an impressive project at Brentford to seize an opportunity that was too good to turn down, also at his boyhood club, Aston Villa.Smith has swiftly made great inroads there, imprinting his high-intensity style on a talented but thin squad before Sunday’s derby at home to Birmingham City. As Smith said after his team beat Derby last time out, Villa have got “bums off seats”. Smith may be blessed by the riches at his disposal, particularly in attacking areas – Jack Grealish is arguably the most gifted midfielder in the ision and the Chelsea loanee Tammy Abraham has 28 goals in 52 Championship appearances – but it is a tough job, underlined by Steve Bruce’s undoing. If Smith can steer Villa back to the Premier League he will successfully elevate himself to a status that, with respect, would have eluded him at Griffin Park. For Smith the potential rewards were understandably impossible to refuse.The brutality of the business is clear but there is no shortage of interest in vacancies, with AFC Wimbledon receiving 80 applications for the post that Neal Ardley held for six years. But what happens to the next wave of hungry managers proving themselves in the lower reaches of English football?It is hypothetical but is there sufficient motivation for the likes of John Coleman and Jim Bentley – who have performed miracles at Accrington Stanley and Morecambe respectively – or Nathan Jones at Luton Town, or Danny Cowley at Lincoln City, to climb, say, one ision at the risk of losing what they have built? Whenever it may be, the next move is pivotal.Cowley, speaking in April about the future for him and his brother, assistant manager Nicky, said: “We’re ambitious, there’s no doubt about that. But sometimes the ambitions can be in the journey, and the journey we are on we’ve been lucky enough to be part of five promotions and I think that’s allowed us to have these gradual steps.“We are very, very careful not to get ahead of ourselves and run before we can walk. This is only our second year in full-time management. We feel like we are learning and developing every day, and I’m not sure we need to get off this pathway at this moment.”• MK Dons have moved top of League Two but Paul Tisdale insists doing so means “diddly squat”. His side are unbeaten in the league since September and boast the meanest defence in the ision. The former Arsenal midfielder Chuks Aneke has been influential, scoring 10 goals in 14 appearances. “We’re only in November,” Tisdale said. “We need to resist the temptation to feel good about ourselves.”• Luke Varney scored twice as Michael Duff toasted his first league win in charge of Cheltenham, at Notts County. The 36-year-old striker scored his third and fourth goals of the season to help the Robins to victory. The oldest player in the Football League, though, is 39-year-old Dannie Bulman, the Crawley Town midfielder in his third spell with the club. Elsewhere, the 43-year-old former Bristol Rovers striker Jamie Cureton celebrated his 350th career goal last weekend, scoring for Bishop’s Stortford against Whitehawk in the Bostik Premier Division. “The body’s sort of holding up,” Cureton said. “There’s a few aches and pains every now and then but I think it’s more just me trying to look after myself and having the drive to want to keep going.”• The boardroom reshuffle at Reading continues, with the chief executive Ron Gourlay resigning two months after the departure of Dutchman Brian Tevreden as the director of football. Gourlay, the former Chelsea CEO, was influential in appointing Paul Clement, the manager who has won two of his past eight matches and takes his team to Wigan on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b115ea2ddb29b770f94ae277928625e4f516412/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8dc252c90ed31ca97b6be8aec169bd7","title":"age is no barrier the veteran stars of masters athletics","story":"Masters medal winners from around the world explain how they came to lace up their running – and jumping – shoesThe world of Masters athletics contains all the drama of regular sporting competition, with the additional compelling feature that the athletes are aged from 35 to over 100. But who are these doughty stars of the track, who keep competing long after most of us have stashed our trainers under the spare bed for good?Lesley ChaplinThe bright-eyed track star from Atlanta, Georgia, has enjoyed a flat out astonishing 2018 so far, breaking no fewer than three separate world records in her age category’s 800m indoor, one-mile outdoor and one-mile indoor races. Upliftingly, the 60-year-old credits at least part of her success to husband – and coach – Tom Hintz. “I love being coached by my husband,” she says. “We both share the same love and passion for track.” Surely it sometimes gets a bit stressful, working with a spouse? “He’s very good at wearing two hats.”Events: W60: 400m, 800m, 1,500mBarry FergusonThe 76-year-old hurdler first joined Cambridge Harriers running club back in 1983. He was invited on to the Masters circuit, albeit with only modest success. With his 50th birthday looming, Ferguson decided to take his preparation more seriously – and went on to not only win his next race but set a new British record, which opened the floodgates to a slew of gold medals and records. “I have now travelled all over the world to countries I would not have visited otherwise, for example, Japan, South Korea and Brazil,” Ferguson says.Events: Sprint hurdles – 60m, 80mSue YeomansJust two years after she began training aged 47, Yeomans vaulted her way to victory at the 2002 world championships. So what does she consider her highest accomplishment? “It’s a toss up really – Porto Alegre Brazil 2013 was my most golds in one world championship, in pole vault, high jump, long jump and triple jump. Or there is my comeback world championship gold in pole vault, and a championship record in Perth, Australia six weeks after my mastectomy.” Talk about setting the bar.Events: Pole vault, high jump, long jump, triple jumpMary Trotto“I just completed my tenth decathlon,” says the remarkable 71-year-old athlete from Kihea, Hawaii. “And I still do the steeplechase.” Trotto reckons that beyond the simple joy of competing and winning medals, staying in peak Masters condition improves her quality of life in all sorts of erse ways. “I can play with young nieces and nephews, I can go all day with their asking and visiting without getting tired. I feel strong.”Events: All running events, especially 5km, decathlon, sometimes triathlonPaul OslandA former Olympian who represented his native Canada during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Osland is the current chief executive of Athletics Ontario. He’s looking forward to the Masters World Championships coming to his hometown of Toronto in 2020. “In 2005, I attended my first world championships in Spain. I won the M40 800m race, even though I wasn’t even aware of Masters racing until just a few months prior to the championships.”Events: 800m and 1,500m, occasional 400m, 4x400m and 4x800m relays, some javelin, high jump and pole vaultJoanna HarperHarper, from Portland, Oregon, has been a reliable fixture of the Masters scene since turning 40 in 1997. Until 2004, she competed in the men’s ision, but was forbidden from entering the female ision until three years later despite transitioning her gender. “Those were dark years, when I only entered races on an unofficial basis,” Harper told us. Her data-led work unpicking the stigma of trans women in athletics has seen her make fierce, articulate appearances on Fox News and on the pages of the Washington Post.Events: Distance running, 1,500m to marathonMoira WestWest’s journey to the Masters began more than two decades ago. “Aged 46, I put on some trainers and went for a jog. A lady I met while out running said I could join her for company and when I could run 2 miles she’d take me to the local Overton Harriers club. So it started – 5k became 10k and I enjoyed road races and cross-country. Aged 50, a teammate suggested I would be better suited to sprinting. I entered the Cardiff indoor Masters championships and got a silver medal in the 200m, and in 2012 was awarded my first world championship medal.”Events: 60m, 100m, 200m and 400mJohn WaskoAs a resident of American Samoa in the South Pacific, Wasko faces a daunting commute whenever he wants to compete at the Masters. But he still trains just as hard. “Personal satisfaction isn’t always about being at a big meet,” the 74-year-old says. “It’s knowing you’re competitive with other athletes. My times are up there with the top runners in the world.” He’s evangelical about track running. “It’s not like soccer where there’s overtime, a second chance. When the gun goes off you have to excel, even if nobody is in the other lane.”Events: 100m, 200m, 400m"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic. There are train stations at Crosskeys, Hengoed and Quakers Yard.Pit stopsLord Nelson Inn, Commercial St, Nelson, Treharris. Cafe on the Rock, the Old Drift Mine, Trelewis, Treharris.Distance: 10.6 miles Start: Aberdeen station End: DrumoakTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours, at a leisurely paceThe Deeside Way in its entirety follows a former railway line from Aberdeen to Ballater, of which this is a 10-mile, largely traffic-free section. Start at the Polmuir Road entrance of Aberdeen’s Duthie park, behind the Winter Gardens. One of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, it is well worth a visit, with rare plants from around the world, and the tantalising “corridor of perfumes”.Follow the leafy path past homes and parkland, and under tree canopies towards Peterculter. You’ll join a quiet country road at Coalford keep on the path until you reach an access road leading to Drumoak. There are three former stations en route, as well as the Peterculter Heritage Centre and, a short distance from the Deeside Way at Drumoak, the 13th-century Drum Castle.

The popular route, in the heart of the Peak District, is steeped in geological, industrial and rail heritage. There are six rail tunnels, four of which are around 400-metres long and lit during the day, as well as excellent views from Monsal, Headstone and Miller’s viaducts. From Blackwell Mill, just south of Buxton, head east through enchanting Chee Dale, in the Upper Wye valley. The lime kilns at Millers Dale station are imposing, fortress-like structures, cut into the rock face.Pit stop Hassop Station Cafe is in an old station building on the trail, complete with sun terrace.

The Red Squirrel route links two traffic-free trails, and the compact island’s north and east coasts, with some on-road sections running through towns. Starting at Cowes, it traces the Medina River to Blackwater, before wending through peaceful countryside, following the River Yar to Sandown. En route are Osborne House (above left), Queen Victoria and Albert’s former holiday home, Cowes Maritime Museum, the Museum of Island History in Newport, Carisbrooke Castle and Dinosaur Isle, in Sandown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae32aa9665c8bb81e78575c511a20b24227276c/407_46_2136_1282/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a9783d5bd14517a526fb0038048d52","title":"the ebike has landed six models to get you on the road","story":"The age of the ebike has arrived, helping to make a pedal to work or the shops easier than ever. From the high-end to the competitively priced, here are six electric bikes to spark your imaginationSo you like the idea of cycling but you’re put off by thinking it could be too intense? Or maybe you’d be fine with getting on a bike if it wasn’t for that merciless hill nearby.Electric bikes, or ebikes, are a great solution for non-cyclists. You can enjoy exercise as you pedal on the flat, but the onboard battery can bolster your effort, making hills manageable – and quicker – without reducing you to a puddle of sweat. That extra oomph also means you can breeze away from traffic lights with minimal exertion.So what sort of ebike would you like? One that looks noticeably different from regular rides, or one that blends in, so nobody spots your unfair advantage? Before you go making that kind of decision, it’s worth noting that an ebike attracts a price premium for the extra electronics. You’ll also have to remember to charge the battery fairly regularly – after all, this adds around 6kg to the bike’s weight, so if you let it go flat, you’ll need to pedal harder on your suddenly heavy ride.Gocycle GSFrom £2,499 from gocycleThe British-designed Gocycle has a magnesium frame, which makes it both great-looking and tremendously light it’s a slick, assured ride. Weighing in at around 16kg, the GS is partly foldable for easier carrying, although it’s nowhere near as fast to open and close as the Brompton (see below). The docking station for faster recharging, available separately, reduces recharge time from seven hours to less than four, providing a range of between 40 and 50 miles, after which it’s just down to you to do the pedalling. This is Gocycle’s fourth ebike, and its most accomplished – with an exceptional attention to detail in the design. This includes what Gocycle calls a Cleandrive, which means the chain and oil are in an enclosed housing to keep your jeans oil-free.Gtech eBike SportFrom £995.99 from gtechBritish manufacturer Gtech makes ebikes in two styles: Sport and City. The Sport has a 51cm frame with crossbar, while the City has a 43cm step-through frame. In either case, the bike needs to be assembled when it arrives. This is not arduous, and online videos can guide you through this, as well as how to operate the battery. It’s not as powerful as some bikes here, but more than competent. And it’s very well-priced – under £1,000 including delivery. It also comes with a 14-day trial, so you can return it if you don’t get on with it. But it is an appealing, fun ride that offers plenty of electric support. The battery range is quoted at 30 miles, so you need to charge it more frequently than most, but it also charges faster than most other ebikes, taking three hours against the typical five or more.Brompton ElectricFrom £2,595 from bromptonThe familiar Brompton folding bike now has an electric version, which looks almost identical to other bikes in the range. The removable battery sits in a bag in front of the handlebars, connecting to the small but powerful motor, which sits on the front wheel. You can customise the handlebar shape and the gearing, and the Brompton is just a little heavier than the Gocycle GS. The ride and feel of the Brompton is very similar to a non-powered model nippy and precise, in other words. And the fold, which is quick and effective, is second to none. It’s one of the things that makes the brand so deservedly successful, and the 40cm wheels help the folded bike feel particularly compact. The other benefit of a Brompton, electric or otherwise, is that you can take it indoors with you, reducing the chances of it being stolen.Pinnacle Lithium Ion 2018£2,000 from evanscyclesThe Lithium Ion – from Pinnacle, Evans Cycles’ in-house brand – is a very comfortable ride, equally at home on country roads or urban streets. The detachable battery sits on the frame and is hard to miss. But because it’s removable you only need to charge that rather than carrying the whole bike up a flight of stairs, say. Although it’s visible, the battery is well placed to balance the bike, and you don’t feel it as you’re riding. It includes disc brakes that are responsive and effective on even steep downhills or in damp weather. Battery range is about 60 miles, a touch more than some here. But if you keep it in the high-assistance mode, it’ll be much less than that, perhaps half.Volt Pulse£1,499 from voltbikesVolt specialises in electric bikes, and the strikingly designed Pulse is one of its standout models. It comes with a choice of frame sizes and battery capacities, so you can ride for up to 60 or up to 80 miles, as you please. Pedal assistance is very smooth – so much so that you may fool yourself into thinking you’re doing all the work. Bikes, ebikes included, are mostly priced according to the quality of components on board and the parts here, including disc brakes, are excellent, meaning less adjustment and maintenance. The battery can be detached when you need to charge it, although you need to remove the seat post to do so.Pendleton Somerby Electric£850 from halfordsOlympic gold-medal winner Victoria Pendleton is behind this Halfords range of bikes, all of which are competitively priced and well built. The electric model comes in a step-through frame in two sizes, 43cm and 48cm. The battery sits on the back wheel, with a luggage rack helpfully placed on top. If you don’t look too closely, it absolutely looks like a regular, classically styled bike. Mudguards come as standard. It’s heavier than some here, although the battery power will help alleviate the effect of that. Although it’s not the nippiest bike around, it suits a gentle commute or weekend ramble. The white and navy frame won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s also available in a more discreet midnight black (with rose gold accents)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd11e7b1b7463c2b603bc491b63d881667aa44a/171_113_2379_1428/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5054ccf5f24480f05ef341d5cb3921d","title":"no time for the gym then try hiit the workout you can do anywhere","story":"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be done in a matter of minutes and delivers fitness in dense, bite-size chunks of exercise throughout the day.

HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11aae75f8dfacf552f12d264eb208475d6a6fe68/0_0_2932_1759/master/2932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86bf9e9b002cd4c60a714500668ac3f","title":"conservatives launch campaign to help low paid women","story":"Penny Mordaunt to unveil initiative to help ‘every woman in UK do whatever she wants to do’The government’s equalities department is to switch its focus away from getting high-paid women on company boards and towards helping lower-paid and unskilled women, Penny Mordaunt, the women and equalities minister, has announced.Mordaunt will claim on Wednesday that there has been significant progress in closing the gender pay gap and getting more female executives on company boards, but women with poor skills and low levels of English were being left behind.At a speech for the Bright Blue thinktank, she will say that her department will focus on the “multiple barriers” to becoming independentand highlight that about 1.8 million women are economically inactive because they are caring for their home or family, more than eight times the number of men in that position.The department will provided a small pot of cash towards that new objective – including a £600,000 fund to help women return to work, aimed at women who have experienced problems such as homelessness, domestic abuse or poor mental health. About £100,000 will support women facing multiple barriers – such as limited English-language skills .“It will be our mission to ensure that every woman in the UK has as much freedom, choice, capacity, resilience, support and protection, to do whatever she wants to do,” Mordaunt is expected to say. “To do that, we need to broaden out the work of the Government Equalities Office to focus on women at every stage of their lives.”One of the statistics highlighted by Mordaunt will be that women are three times more likely than men to work part-time and in poorly paid sectors, such as caring, customer service and cleaning rolesThe government had been accused of neglecting the equalities office, which does not have a dedicated secretary of state, and staff had been shunted between different departments including the Home Office, the Department for Education and the Department for International Development in recent years.Mordaunt, who is also international development secretary, will also announce on Wednesday that the department will move permanently into the Cabinet Office, which will allow staff to work more closely with civil servants on other relevant projects, including the Race Disparity Unit, and the Office of Disability Issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a300b594120b951af9446001617e4dc96d5cab1/0_0_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2d4f4c1557ad92aeacd7deae566c94f","title":"triathlons ultramarathons and ambitious baking why is modern leisure so competitive","story":"Everything from reading to swimming to cooking can now be tracked or optimised. What is this quest for perfection doing to our free time?If you spend much time mooching around the internet, you will probably have come across articles on sites such as Quartz and Forbes called things like “17 habits of highly successful people”. Life hacks of the rich and famous have become the capitalist equivalent of the tales of hardworking coal miners that were once impressed upon Soviet schoolchildren.Invariably, these people wake up at 4.30am Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, does so at weekends, too, so as not to fall out of whack with his weekdays. Unfailingly, they make time for exercise: Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, goes for a hike every Saturday before spending his Sundays reflecting on long-term strategy. Presumably, it was from such contemplative heights that he hit upon his recent scheme to remove the “like” button.Even those of us occupying less happy positions at the late-capitalist coalface might emit a weary bleat of recognition at that. Weekdays are tough. But weekends? Exhausting! “Bullshit jobs” (“It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working,” noted the anthropologist David Graeber in his book of that name this year) would appear to have a corollary in bullshit leisure. Increasingly, our leisure time is not leisure as our parents or grandparents might have enjoyed it: time away from the productive demands of work for pottering, ambling, collecting, socialising. It is leisure with an imperative, self‑imposed or otherwise, to maximise relaxation yield, compete over hobby production and co-opt every activity – exercising, meditating, making Halloween costumes for the kids – into a dynamic of human perfectibility.It is hard to say precisely when this shift took place. The “like” button had something to do with it. But for Alex Boyle, a TV editor and amateur triathlete from Bristol, it really ramped up when he discovered Strava, the social network where more than 30 million people share their training regimes.Alex had always liked taking part in sport, but after he slipped a disc making a treehouse for his children he began to take his fitness more seriously. “I began doing CrossFit to regain my core strength,” he says. “The thing about CrossFit is it’s kind of mechanical, but the CrossFit community is very focused on measuring their performance.” He liked this aspect of it – the demonstrable improvement the way it fed back into his overall fitness – and he soon realised that the principle applied equally well to the triathlon sports: swimming, cycling and running. He treated himself to a sports watch and joined Strava so he could post his times. “It allowed me to turn any section of my commute into a competition. I could choose a section of Gloucester Road and see if I could cycle down it faster than anyone else. Or, if I was swimming, I could focus on beating my own times over 100 metres. It becomes kind of obsessive.”One reason leisure has become more competitive is that it is increasingly quantifiable. Smartwatches keep track of your movements, from steps walked to kilometres skied platforms such as Strava allow you to compare times with peers. The principle works beyond exercise, too. Apps such as Sleepio help you measure how productive your sleep is Calm and Headspace gamify mindfulness and meditation, so it is no longer an antidote to work but a way of preparing yourself for more work.Yet these activity counters are basic compared with what the finest minds in Silicon Valley are trying to create. Bryan Johnson, a co-founder of PayPal, is now leading the neurotech company Kernel, the aim of which is to bring the brain “online” to track what users are thinking about. “Think of it as a step counter for the brain,” he said recently. I can’t see any potential dystopian downsides to that ...Aspects of all this measuring are perfectly innocent. A little competition makes things fun and there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve your triathlon time. However, Dr Thomas Curran, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath, sees a correlation between the increased use of metrics and the rise in perfectionism in young people. In a recent study, he defined this as “an irrational desire to achieve, along with being overly critical of oneself and others”.“Perfectionism is a very problematic trait, especially for those who suffer with it at the clinical end,” he says. “It’s positively associated with depression, anxiety and even suicide. We are not suggesting that every young person is a clinical perfectionist, but we are suggesting that they’re moving further up the spectrum as time unfolds – and that’s concerning.”The way Curran sees it, the culture of metrics has migrated from the business world into our leisure time via education and public services. Schools have become more results-oriented. “In an attempt to make the important measurable, we have instead made the measurable important,” was how the  columnist Simon Jenkins recently summed it up. This has helped to create a generation who see learning as a numbers game, while Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook have done the same with popularity.This has changed the way we view our time off. In a recent essay, In Praise of Mediocrity, the author Tim Wu shared his hunch that we are now afraid of being bad at things: “We are intimidated by the expectation ... that we must actually be skilled at what we do in our free time. Our ‘hobbies’, if that’s even the word for them any more, have become too serious, too demanding, too much an occasion to become anxious about whether you are really the person you claim to be.”To be fair, this is partly a function of growing up. Small children sing, swim, climb, draw, play various sports, make various crafts and don’t much worry if they are any good at them. When you are 37, for example, it is embarrassing to be rubbish at drawing, so we tend to narrow our range of activities. But there is a generational shift here, too. My grandad was a keen photographer, coin collector, cyclist, watercolourist and tropical-fish keeper – and, bless him, he wasn’t much cop at any of them. I don’t think that was the point. His hobbies were ways of absorbing himself and meeting people. There wasn’t the same urge to share and compare and discover how rubbish your efforts were next to some tropical-fish fancier in Colorado with 373,000 followers likewise, my mother has never given much thought to how she might turn her sewing skills into a side hustle. She just likes doing it.Curran sees dark portents in the popularity of The Great British Bake Off and its ilk. “Something that used to be done for enjoyment has been turned into something people do competitively. All sorts of activities have shifted their meaning this way. Making birthday cakes for children in order to get ‘likes’ from people you don’t know? I’m only 30 years old and I can think of no frame of reference for this happening within my lifetime. It’s new.”We could turn to art and literature for some perspective – but these are subject to the same imperatives. Apps such as Joosr and Blinkist condense books into 20-minute versions Instagram is full of great works distilled to one inspiring quote. Even if you manage to read the latest Karl Ove Knausgaard, well, it would be a waste if you didn’t flaunt your erudition with a #shelfie. On Reddit’s podcast forum, a number of users report listening at 1.5x speed, so as to maximise consumption, and express regret that they can’t do the same for Netflix shows. “I do audiobooks at 1.6,” one user explains to me. “It feels like an appeal to intelligence – the natural pauses and implied rimshots are gone. It’s a fast stream of one-two punches that challenges my reaction time and makes me listen harder – and it’s less casual.” Less casual?What would John Maynard Keynes make of it all? In Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1930), the economist expressed hope that, by now, we would all be working three-hour days and spending the rest of our time enjoying our leisure in a more leisurely fashion. Karl Marx hoped that redistributing the gains of industrial production would enable workers to spend their days like 19th-century aristocrats: writing, fishing and hunting.In those days, it was the poor who worked all hours, while the upper classes flaunted their leisure as a status symbol – take those Parisian flâneurs who used to take their tortoises for walks.The members of the early labour movement battled hard to claw back their time and they were successful at it: we have them to thank for our largely work-free weekends. The postwar period was arguably a golden age for the hobbyists. Now, if anything, the 19th-century paradigm has been reversed: automation and associated forces mean those at the lower end of the labour market often don’t have enough work to do, while the rich are time-poor. Busyness is worn as a badge of honour idleness is condemned as a vice.For Rutger Bregman, the author of Utopia for Realists and a proponent of a shorter working week, something is seriously awry. “Right up until the 1970s, philosophers, sociologists and economists were predicting that the biggest challenge of the future would be boredom: what the hell would we do with our time?” he says. “Isaac Asimov predicted that the biggest profession would be psychiatrists, treating people for the symptoms of boredom.” There are plenty of psychiatrists around, but boredom doesn’t tend to be high on their priority list. “We’re almost suffering from the opposite,” Bregman says.From an economic point of view, the decline of leisure is not as illogical as it first appears. It was the US economist Gary Becker who first explored this, in A Theory of the Allocation of Time (1965). Time is money. The more money you earn, the more valuable your time is. The more valuable something is, the less inclined you are to waste it. That is why people in London walk faster than people in rural Cornwall. It is why a banker is more likely to ask you to sponsor their ultramarathon effort than, say, a fisherman.But Bregman feels there may be nonmaterial factors at play, too. “We live in a sort of inverse welfare state, where the most important jobs – the nurses, the teachers, the refuse collectors – are paid the least. It’s actually the least important jobs – the management consultants, the financiers the bullshit jobs, in other words – that pay the most. So, my hypothesis is that the elites have demanding jobs in terms of energy and effort, but they provide them with no meaning. Humans are meaning-seeking creatures. If you’re sitting in the office all day sending emails to people you don’t like, writing reports that no one will read, designing financial products that only destroy wealth, building algorithms that make people click on more ads … it’s a pretty depressing existence, isn’t it? So, the less meaning you find in your 70-hour-a-week job, the more extreme you will get as you pursue your leisure time.”As Bregman points out, busyness is not a society-wide phenomenon: “It’s more something you see among the elites in the big cities, applying the high standards of their working lives to their leisure time, too.” Quality leisure, like quality work, is unevenly distributed.There is a gender bias, too. In 2015 (the most recent available data set), British men took an average of 43 hours of leisure time a week women took about 38 hours. “There isn’t much evidence to suggest that we’re getting less leisure time overall,” says Chris Payne, a senior research officer at the Office for National Statistics. “But women are seeing a reduction since 2000. Women are entering the labour market in greater numbers. Meanwhile, they’re not being compensated for the amount of unpaid work they do. Men aren’t really picking up the pieces back at home.” This, he adds, is an international trend: men train for triathlons while their wives look after the children.When I surveyed my friends, I discovered that quite a few had hobbies that they keep quiet about – usually something cultivated as an antidote to screens, “likes”, metrics and doing. One takes photographs on film and puts them up on a Tumblr, the URL of which she never shares. One mother I know finds time for pottery, chess and DJing. Especially since I moved out of London last year, it has been a pleasant surprise to discover that plenty of actual adults still play in bands and go rock climbing and perform wholesome public works. I have found time to go swimming, too. I have no desire to compete with anyone. I do it mostly because I enjoy the feeling of being suspended in another element, the coolness, weightlessness and motion. I also like the discernible progress I have made over six months with the aid of the occasional YouTube instructional video and notes from other swimmers: I have gone from thrashing around and panting whenever I attempted front crawl to serenely gliding up and down.One reason I like it is that getting into the right rhythm leaves room for almost no other thoughts. Another is that there is a straightforward relationship between effort and reward. If you keep at it, you get better. In very few areas of 21st-century life is that true. But, naturally, when I managed to swim a mile, I shared it on Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf938b8b79b3a6eb08edf15804a2814591c8af05/0_701_7210_4328/master/7210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a22e5ade248f36c02c31fc7bc9d01e6","title":"uk ban on kelloggs coco pops childrens tv advert overturned","story":"Obesity campaigners criticise U-turn on granola ad that used sugary brand’s character Kellogg’s, the maker of Coco Pops, has beaten a junk food advert ban after lobbying to overturn a decision by the UK’s advertising regulator, in a move that has outraged obesity campaigners.In August, the Advertising Standards Authority banned a Kellogg’s TV ad campaign for a Coco Pops granola product for breaking rules against advertising junk food to children.However, the food manufacturer has managed to overturn the ban after lodging an appeal for an independent review of the decision, which is only accepted if it is established that there was a “substantial flaw” in the initial ruling.“Following a lobbying effort from Kellogg’s, the ASA has rowed back from their original decision,” said Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, which lodged the original complaint with the ASA. “The original ruling closed a loophole preventing food companies from advertising to children by using characters and music associated with their unhealthy products.“This is what happens when a large multinational food company uses its legal weight to fight rulings that influence their profits. Sadly, the price is the future health of our children. This is just another example of why we need strong government action to protect children from unhealthy food marketing, starting with a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV.”While the ASA deemed in the original ruling that the granola product itself was not junk food, it said that the wider content and context of the ad broke the UK advertising code and banned it.The advert, they say, featured Kellogg’s famous Coco the monkey character and focused on making the cereal “chocolatey” – a hallmark of the wider Coco Pops range, which is deemed to be too sugary to market to children – and not enough on the product being advertised, healthier granola.Under UK rules, children cannot be targeted with adverts for products that are high in fat, salt and sugar, and licensed characters should not be used to promote such products to them.In its appeal, Kellogg’s argued that the ad did show the granola product as being clearly differentiated from the core Coco Pops range, and that rules the ASA enforces state that it is fine to use a brand character usually associated with a sugary food to promote a healthy one.Kellogg’s argued that to rule that the ad for the granola product broke junk food rules “would be inconsistent with the government’s objectives on tackling unhealthy eating and discourage advertisers from developing healthier product alternatives”.Following the independent review, the ASA has now cleared the ad of breaking any UK advertising rules.It is relatively uncommon for the ASA to be forced into overturning a decision like the Kellogg’s case. The last one was last November in a year that the ASA dealt with over 27,000 complaints about more than 19,000 ads.A spokeswoman for Kellogg’s said: “We felt the original judgment had potential unintended consequences for the industry and the positive intent of the regulations – acting as a disincentive for food companies like us to develop and launch ‘better for you’ alternatives at a time when people are looking to our industry to take action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

Not yet? Many people never do. One in three adults in the UK have no private pension, and will rely on the state pension in old age. Even those who do start saving usually only get round to it in their 40s and 50s, upping their pension contributions in the hope of retiring in their 60s. But there is a new breed of supersavers who have no intention of waiting that long. They intend to quit before the age of 40 and live a free life.The Financial Independence, Retire Early (Fire) movement originated in the US, but has spread to the UK, attracting twenty- and thirtysomethings who do not intend to spend 40 years strapped to the corporate machine. Instead, they are practising a combination of extreme saving and rigorous investing to try to build up the “stash” you need – commonly seen as 25 times your annual expenditure – to quit, or, as these millennials put it, to “get Fired”.Hall says it’s a question of being organised, not miserly. “I wouldn’t want to come across as some tight old git who doesn’t socialise,” he insists. He says the choices he makes are simply rational, and mentions using the free coffee machine in his office rather than stopping off for an expensive one at the shop at the entrance. “You would not believe how many people every single day get the coffee downstairs, paying £2.50 or £3. Do that every day for a year and it adds up to quite a significant number. Going out for lunch is another big thing.” Make your own sandwiches, he suggests.He is putting his money into a lifetime Isa and “passive” tracker funds, which follow the stock market and charge low fees because they are not actively managed. He intends to buy a property in Manchester, rent it out and perhaps work abroad. “I enjoy my job for now, but things can change, and when I’m 30 or 35 I’d like to have the option of thinking: ‘Do you know what? Stuff it. I’m going to go and do something else.’ The goal is not retirement, but freedom to do whatever I want to do.”Dave Hamilton, who is 41 and lives in south London, retired five years ago after spending 15 years working in data analytics. “I was always convinced there was more to life and more fun to be had in the world of nonwork,” he says. He has paid off his mortgage and, after spending the final seven years of his working life saving £35,000 of his £75,000 salary, has accumulated a pot of £500,000. Properly invested, he says, this should keep him going for the rest of his life. “I have very simple tastes. I don’t buy flashy clothes, cars, computers. My aim wasn’t to retire rich, but to retire with a realistic understanding of what I would need for my living standards to continue.”He says his family and friends thought he was mad. “‘Why are you doing this?’ they said. ‘You’ve got a good job. You’ll get bored. I reckon you’ll be back in a year.’ I didn’t know what I was going to do, I just knew that the world was full of things I wanted to see and do, and even if I chose to watch daytime TV all week, at least I didn’t have to go into the office at someone else’s beck and call. Now, I have been retired for more than five years. In that time, I’ve travelled a lot, got married, had a child, learned Italian, taken up painting and built a house. I play a lot of tennis and rarely switch on the telly. I spend much less money now because the things I enjoy don’t cost that much.”Emily (she prefers not to reveal her surname), who is 44 and earns £90,000 a year at a scientific company, is another committed Fire follower. She says she will work at most for another 10 years. That would make her a late retiree by Fire standards, but she wants to be sure she will never have to do paid work again.She admits to getting carried away now and again, and imposing “shopping bans” where she does not buy anything except food. “You can get really obsessed about not spending any money, and that’s not good for you either,” she says. “The whole point about saving a huge pot of cash is not having to stress about money, so overstressing about saving that pot of cash isn’t doing you any good. You need to find that sweet spot between saving a decent amount and still living a life.”Mr Money Mustache, AKA Pete Adeney, is the standard-bearer for Fire. A 44-year-old Canadian living in Colorado, he worked for 10 years before packing it all in just after he turned 30. He describes himself as a “mild-mannered retired computer engineer”. “I realised in my mid-20s that I was perfectly content to ride my bike to work and cook my own dinner,” he says. “So I had no interest in spending the relatively high salary that even an average income earner, let alone an engineer, makes here in the US. But I knew that money was a useful thing, so I wanted to put it to good use. I decided that buying my own freedom was probably the best use of that money.”He ided his life into two phases – the working, earning, saving part and the living, creating, parenting part. “As a young engineer, I remember seeing what a challenge my older colleagues faced with having to ide their attention between their careers and their kids,” he says. “It seemed like they were not able to give their full efforts to either endeavour. So, I decided to focus purely on my work for that period of my life, and then focus on being a dad for the 18 years thereafter. I’m currently on year 13 of the second project.” He and his wife orced recently, but he says they are “still very close co-parents”.Through his widely read blog, Adeney has become the philosopher king of the movement, though he admits his ideas were anticipated by earlier practitioners such as Jacob Lund Fisker in his blog Early Retirement Extreme. Adeney calls his version of Fire “Mustachianism”, and says he started his blog in 2011 “out of a sense of exasperation”. “Already six years into retirement at that point, I was amazed that peers with similarly high incomes were not only still stuck working, but were still living almost paycheck to paycheck,” he says. His main tenet is that “happiness is not very expensive” – it is only retail companies and ad agencies that try to persuade you it is.He tells his adherents, no matter how much they are earning, that they should aim to save and invest half their income. “At this level, your mandatory work career is about 17 years,” he says. “Just for comparison, saving three-quarters puts you at about eight years. It’s not really about early retirement it’s about starting to live the best life you can right now, with more purpose and less stress. My blog has never really been about money it is about encouraging humans to live happier and more rational lives.”Barney Whiter, AKA the Escape Artist, is the best-known UK-based disciple of Mustachianism. Now 48, he retired five years ago after a 20-year career in corporate finance. On his blog, he says he paid off his mortgage when he was 32, built up an investment portfolio and quit his job at the age of 43.I tell Whiter Mustachianism sometimes sounds like a cult, and to my surprise he agrees. “You’ve got this charismatic leader and these very loyal followers,” he admits. But, he says, those followers are very erse. “The people who come to the meet-ups are anything but clones. What they have in common is a desire not to be ripped off by ‘the Man’. They don’t subscribe to consumerism.”Whiter says the Fire movement will get a boost early next year with the release of Travis Shakespeare’s documentary Playing With Fire, which charts the rise of the movement and looks at one couple’s efforts to achieve financial independence. Shakespeare has skin in the game, he says, because he has been practising Fire for the past decade, having previously been “financially illiterate” and still in the red when he turned 40. Discovering Fisker’s and Adeney’s writings (and inheriting some money from his father) saved him. “I told myself: ‘I have a chance now to not end up eating cat food in my old age.’”Eight years on, he is financially independent, and feels this has allowed his career as a producer and director to flourish. “I began to make bolder choices at work because I knew that if I ‘failed’, I had a reliable backup plan,” he says.Shakespeare argues that people who free themselves from what he calls “obligatory work” will be a force for good because many of them will use their creativity for socially useful ends, and that they have the capacity to become standard-bearers for anti-consumerism. He traces the idea of a fulfilled, liberated life back to 19th-century writer Henry David Thoreau and his paean to nature, Walden. The Fire movement even has its own version of Thoreau in Elizabeth Willard Thames, AKA Mrs Frugalwoods, who has written a book about opting out of urban life and buying 26 hectares (66 acres) of woodland in rural Vermont, on which she lives with her husband and two daughters. Like Adeney, she hymns the simple, outdoor life unencumbered by excess – a rival American dream to the consumerist one. Both dreams require money – buying 66 acres of rural Vermont complete with house and barn cost the Frugalwoods $389,000.Does Fire have anything to offer people on lower incomes? Most of the practitioners in the UK who I speak to are sceptical. It is possible to see the whole movement as malign (Whiter wonders whether I am preparing a “hatchet job”), with middle-class people using rising property prices and a buoyant stock market to become a new leisured aristocracy.I don’t want to do a hatchet job – I can see that financial independence is attractive, and that an anticonsumerism philosophy, even if more libertarian than socially driven, can be positive. But you can’t ignore what one Fire aspirant called the movement’s “dirty little secret”: saving on a low income is hell. What does Fire offer those who are on low-paying or zero hours contracts, can’t escape high rent or childcare costs, and will be lucky to get out of poverty and enjoy leisure on a reasonable income at 70, let alone 40?“Your question is one that I have also grappled with,” Shakespeare says. “Obviously Fire is not a path for the working poor, and I don’t think anyone is claiming it ever could be. However, once a person earns more than she needs for basic expenses, she is in a position to grow wealth and pursue a greater sense of freedom and agency over her life.” Shakespeare suggests adopting an incremental approach – everyone who has something left over from spending on essentials should save what they can to buy some degree of freedom. “I personally think of Fire less in terms of polarity – ie, you’re either financially independent or not – and more in terms of stages,” he says. “For example, if someone is able to save a month’s salary, he is protected from events like a water heater going out or a car breakdown. If he saves six months, his ability to comfortably manoeuvre, say, a job change is much more powerful. A year’s savings gives a person the ability to take a year off, try to start a business, go back to school, etc. All these markers grant the inidual greater power over, for lack of a better phrase, wage slavery. If you’ve got three years of wages in the bank you can make even bolder decisions.”“My favourite debate!” says Whiter. “The tools and techniques of Fire are needed more by low-income people – to avoid them being fucked over by the system.” In a blogpost entitled Financial Independence Is for Everyone, he tackles the subject head on: “If you’re not a high earner, it’s even more important not to piss your money away on ridiculous spending. Living paycheck to paycheck leaves people at the bottom of society prone to disaster. They, more than anyone, need the techniques of financial independence to build a safety net and gain options to improve their life.”In another post last month, Whiter featured his friend Ken Okoroafor, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria at the age of 14, speaking poor English, lived in a bedsit and encountered daily racism. Twenty years later, he too is financially independent. If Okoroafor could do it, suggested Whiter, anyone could. But he went on to make a more general point – that everyone, whatever their circumstances, can do something to improve their situation. “Sometimes, people tell me that not everyone can get to financial independence,” he writes. “I file that information under ‘N’ for ‘No shit, Sherlock’. Not everyone can run a marathon in three hours either. But more people would be able to run five or 10 miles if they put down the doughnuts and went for a run.”Greg had a brain haemorrhage last year – which was the trigger to put their plan into action. The Owens were keen on boating and, when Greg recovered, they sold their house in Bradford and bought a 55ft narrowboat. They now cruise the canals of Yorkshire, moving on every couple of weeks to avoid mooring fees. They have a budget of about £750 a month, which they admit is tight, but say that having to forgo a few luxuries is worth it in exchange for the freedom.I ask them what their children think of their nomadic lifestyle. “They are somewhere between amused and despairing,” says Frankie, “but I think they are secretly quite pleased. They understand that we want to do something for us and that we worked hard for a long time.” Greg, who used to be a copywriter, says having their first child at 19 meant they were never “young and free”, so they have chosen freedom now. A perfect example of living your life backwards, though they accept that in a couple of decades, when they take their occupational and state pensions, they may come back on to dry land and invest in a flat. Until then, they just hope to stay afloat.Financial advisers, who may feel threatened by the Fire community’s capacity for independent action, are largely dismissive of its approach. “People need to realise that we can’t have our cake and eat it,” Martin Stewart, director of the financial advice firm London Money, told the Daily  in September. “Sure, save half your salary, eat the roadkill, bin-dip, raid the charity shops, recycle everything, just stay in and actually read the T\u0026ampCs of things rather than waste money going out. From this you will create lots of savings, but sadly very few memories.”“I hate it,” the US personal finance guru Suze Orman said last month when asked about Fire on the Afford Anything podcast. “As you get older, things happen. You’re hit by a car, you fall down on the ice, you get sick, you get cancer. Things happen, and if you don’t have a significant amount of money, what are you going to do? You are going to burn up alive.” By significant amount of money she didn’t mean $250,000 (£195,000) or even a million. “Two million is nothing,” she said. “It’s nothing. It’s pennies in today’s world.” She thought $10m might just about do it.“This thinking is completely backwards,” Adeney countered in a blogpost. “Money will not cure your fear, as the megamillionaire Suze proves so clearly. If you are afraid of what might happen in the future, you have a mental problem rather than a financial problem.”He ended his counterblast with what sounded like a manifesto. Fire, he said, is “a system of living your best life in all ways rather than just the financial, based on our best understanding of human nature, with a bit of math and science behind it … It’s always open for modification or improvement, but like science itself, there’s nothing for a rational person to hate. Who hates learning? The reason it has spread to millions of people is that it works. People try it, they like the results, so they share it with their friends, and the cycle repeats. There’s no stopping an idea or a movement like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc762556bd1d26b633cbb71c310d155795edf4c/0_205_2606_1564/master/2606.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e18c5d142cdd5073d811919252847b","title":"katy perry 2018 highest paid woman music beonce","story":"Forbes’ annual list sees Perry rise from ninth place to unseat Beyoncé, now in third place behind Taylor SwiftForbes has named Katy Perry as 2018’s highest paid woman in music.

The biggest question isn’t which of these multimillionaires will triumph, but why anyone would care. The match-up has nothing to do with golf any more than Muhammad Ali’s 1976 fight with Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki had anything to do with boxing. Or, for that matter, my 1992 one-on-one matchup with Julius Irving had anything to do with basketball. Since these showbiz events don’t enhance or redefine sport in any way, there must be some kind of metaphoric value that justifies the millions of dollars they generate – a glitzy-yet-heartfelt theme we can all get behind.My own match against Dr J 26 years ago – billed as the “Clash of the Legends” – wasn’t great basketball, but it wasn’t meant to be. Julius was 41 and I was 44, roughly the same ages as Woods and Mickelson are now. It was showbiz, giving fans what they wanted. We huffed and puffed and did our best, but we were clearly not the players we were in our prime. But so what? The fans wanted to see two middle-aged men work their asses off to prove that we still had the spark of greatness, if not the full-blown flames. We did just that. The score didn’t matter, nor who won. What mattered was that we showed we still had a few moves, a few flashes of glory.As for Wood v Mickelson, this certainly isn’t a “great white hope” event that pits white against black to determine racial superiority. Given the political atmosphere created by golferWhite Nationalist-in-Chief Donald J Trump that has amped up racial tensions, one could understand if some mistook it for that. However, Woods and Mickelson are friendly toward each other and are jovially promoting this as nothing more than a high-noon duel between veteran pros. Plus, it’s golf. Not a whole lot of African Americans have racial pride invested in The Stroll Toward Another Far Away Hole (not exactly the dynamic ring of The Thrilla in Manilla).African Americans have always had a mixed reaction to both golf and Woods. Despite the presence of municipal golf courses, which are meant to be more affordable, it still costs around $40 for 18 holes versus $0 for shooting hoops in the park. And if you want to play at the top courses, like Augusta National, annual fees can reach five or six figures. This may be why even a historically black school like Bethune-Cookman University has a nine-member men’s golf team with only two black players while the four-member women’s team has only one black player. This is 21 years after Woods destroyed the white ceiling by winning the Masters by 12 strokes. “I knew none of this meant, necessarily, things would change dramatically for minorities in golf,” Woods said years later about his historic victory. “I hoped my win would encourage them to play, or to chase their dreams whatever they were. But it would have been naive of me to think my win would mean the end of ‘the look’ when a person from any minority walked into some golf clubs, especially the game’s private clubs.” Wendell Haskins, a former PGA senior director of ersity and multicultural initiatives as well as an associate with the NBA, describes the challenge black kids face who want to seriously pursue golf: “You have to have access to elite golf to play elite golf,” he told the Undefeated. “In basketball, let’s say you are a white player from the suburbs. You haven’t been battle-tested until you’ve gone into the inner city and played with some brothers. The same thing goes with golf in reverse. A lot of kids can play golf to an impressive level. But until you’ve played country club golf, under country club conditions, with country club kids, you have not played elite golf.” The numbers suggest that as Woods has declined as a force in golf, so has the number of black golfers. There were 1.5 million black golfers in America in 2007 10 years later, there were only 800,000.Woods’s private life hasn’t established him as much of a role model either. He’s a troubled man who has waded neck-deep into the flotsam of fame. His arrest for driving under the influence of prescription drugs, his adultery, his messy orce, and his proclaimed sex addiction have produced a lot of tongue-clucking and finger-wagging among African Americans who realize that, fair or not, the entire community gets judged by the public failures of its most famous members.And yet, many of us are rooting for him now more than ever. More than a representative of race, he’s a symbol of the one thing we all grudgingly share: aging. His victory at the Tour Championship in September was a startling comeback after five without a tournament win. Mickelson also broke a five-year losing streak when he won the WGC-Mexico Championship in March. The theme of this showdown is perseverance in the face of the inevitable decline of athletic prowess.Every year age jams another 10lbs weight into our backpacks, slowing us down and making us contemplate that time when we stop altogether. But Woods and Mickelson’s recent unexpected triumphs raised the spirits of all of us sagging under the weight of years. They inspire hope, the illusion of permanence, that no matter the age, we can always rally ourselves for one last challenge. I’m reminded of the end of Richard Wilbur’s poem, The Juggler, in which the audience explodes in applause for the title character who lightens their daily struggles:For him we batter our handsWho has won for once over the world’s weight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9524e78138f3193469fa0c39fcabc255c79b1cb8/0_119_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7f41fc006f6034c04f407379405846","title":"australia v india first twenty20 international live","story":"3rd over: India 27-0 (Rohit 4, Dhawan 22) Behrendorff looks good from his first ball, again whizzing past the edge, but Dhawan clubs his second over mid-off for four. Then works a couple of twos, gliding fine before barely dragging it over mid-on.“Evening Geoff,” chirps Phil Withall on email. “Have you got any idea if the state of the outfield is taken into account when implementing the Duckworth Lewis formula? The impact a wet outfield has on a run chase is surely highly detrimental to the chances of the batting team winning.”Wet outfields are not taken into account, no. Mostly because there’s no real way to quantify that. And yes, wet grass can slow down ground balls, but at the same time a wet cricket ball makes life much harder for bowlers. When the ball becomes a bar of soap, batting teams are more likely to get full tosses and wides. So there are pros and cons for both teams, and maybe we just have to accept that they’ll sort of balance out, but that things can’t always balance perfectly.2nd over: India 18-0 (Rohit 4, Dhawan 13) Here comes Stanlake, at six foot eight. Or 204 centimetres if you prefer. “He is hands down the worst bowler I’ve ever had to face in the nets,” says Usman Khawaja who has jumped into the comms box for a visit. By which he means Stanlake is the best, by virtue of being the worst. The least preferred to face. Height and pace. Mostly the Indian openers hop around and blunt him, though Dhawan gets one wide ball to lash on the cut shot.1st over: India 11-0 (Rohit 3, Dhawan 8) A bit of swing first up for Behrendorff, but the left-armer started on Rohit’s leg stump and was easily tucked for three. Part of the challenge for the Australians will be the ball getting wet every time it rolls through the outfield grass - and it does so immediately, as Dhawan the left-hander strides forward into a cover drive for four. Wasn’t the worst ball, but the batsman got it all. Behrendorff pulls his length back and clunks Dhawan in the box. Then draws him forward for an inside edge past leg stump. Four unlucky runs against the bowler. Then another shorter one, moving off the surface, and beating Dhawan’s back-foot force through to the keeper. And beats him again with the sixth! Fuller that time, more movement, and zinged past the edge. Terrific final four deliveries.That’s the score adjustment, on the basis that if Australia had known they had 17 overs to face, they would have paced their innings differently. Smarter people than you or I worked out the numbers on that one. The Powerplay will be five overs, and some bowlers can still bowl up to four overs in the innings. 17th over: Australia 158-4 (Stoinis 33, McDermott 2) Tough for Ben McDermott to come in and tee off. His first ball is slogged through the giant pile of sawdust at the top of the bowler’s mark, and earns him two runs. But he misses the next two big swings completely. Stoinis is sharp enough to run a bye from the second of these to give himself strike for one delivery. But a textbook yorker from Bumrah means that Stoinis can only get two runs digging it out and sprinting. Only half a dozen runs from Bumrah’s over, but it wasn’t supposed to be the final over of the innings.Well you’re on a hiding to nothing in this situation. Bumrah takes some pace off the ball, Maxwell stands still and actually goes with a bit of a helicopter shot trying to whip this ball into the gap behind square leg. But the pace messes with his timing a bit and so it’s in the air, and Bhuvi is there at square leg, the only man anywhere near the bat, to take the catch. Maxwell was at his best tonight, but got done over by the rain.What a bizarre little period that is. You play yourself in and get set. You come off for an hour and get cold. Then you have to come back and face five deliveries. Settle in for the first two, accumulate through the boring middle delivery, then really go big at the death? Looks like we’re close to getting going again. Reduced to 17 overs a side, meaning the Australians have to come out and reset themselves for... five more balls. Will they get a DLS boost to their score for the lost overs though? I’ve done this for years and I can’t even pretend to know how this side of the game works.Looks like the rain has stopped. Now the clean-up begins. It’s raining even harder now. Proper Queenland stuff. Rain that’s as thick sideways as it is lengthways. The upside is that usually in this part of the world it moves fast. Everything at once.Might be the rain costing the crowd some overs now. Though for the first six or seven overs Brenden’s tweet looked on the money.That’s what we’re here for...We’re 16.1 overs in. From that one delivery, Stoinis was dropped at third man. Wafted away at a ball from Bumrah, got plenty on it down to Khaleel, and the new guy has put down a simple catch. After being smashed for 42 from 18 balls thus far. Tough night.But now it’s less than ideal for Australia: Maxwell has really got going for the first time in his last few games, hitting them beautifully, and now he’s had to go off and cool his heels as a Brisbane downpour hits.16th over: Australia 152-3 (Maxwell 46, Stoinis 30) Krunal bowling the next over, this might not be a good idea. The pacemen only have four left between them, the final four of the innings. But Kohli could have gone to Rohit or somebody new to try to sneak through six balls. Will this cost him? The short answer is yes. Six for Stoinis from the first ball, nothing elegant about that but pounded away over square leg, very flat, from a big slog. A couple to the deep for Stoinis, then when he gets off strike, Krunal dishes up a big fat full toss for Maxwell to play tee-ball. Six more. And it might have been another six to close the over, but Glenn Maxwell has hit the Spidercam. Or the Flying Fox, as the new broadcasters are calling it. Whatever it is. It’s hanging up there above the pitch, Maxwell has smoked the ball, and smashed it straight into the highly expensive camera equipment. So the umpire has to call dead ball. That might have saved Maxwell actually, the ball was going fairly close to directly upwards from his bat and he may have been caught somewhere around the ground. Maxwell drives the re-bowled ball down the ground for two, and it’s another good over for Australia worth 17.15th over: Australia 135-3 (Maxwell 38, Stoinis 21) Kuldeep, the main danger, is back for his last over. Kohli hoping to get rid of these danger players. But Kuldeep isn’t quite there. Bowls two wides in the over, and it should have been three had Maxwell not been committed to a reverse sweep when the ball was already angling down leg side. Turned an extra into a single in the end. But maybe facing more balls from Kuldeep wasn’t in Australia’s interests. He’s so hard to hit, so easy to make mistakes against. Australia do alright against him, taking eight from the over thanks to Maxwell going through cover again for a couple of runs.14th over: Australia 127-3 (Maxwell 33, Stoinis 20) It turns out that bowling flat left-arm darts can only get you so far. Maxwell has his last sighter off Krunal by pulling two runs to start the over. And then?Six! Leans away from the line of the ball and hauls his pull shot way over wide long-on. Into the second deck for the second time tonight. That might have gone further than Lynn’s six, way up above the roof line on the replays. Six! Very next ball, a stable base as Maxwell swings simply through the line of the ball and gets it straighter that time, almost over the sight screen.Six! And it’s a hat-trick. Leans away again, this time bringing the bat in a flatter horizontal arc rather than a diagonal swing, but getting more than enough power on a less elegant shape to drop it into the stands again.He drags his next ball through square and sprints hard to get back for the second, then keeps the strike with a single from the final ball. That makes 23 from the over, all of the to Maxwell, for the most profitable over of the night.13th over: Australia 104-3 (Maxwell 10, Stoinis 20) Nearly a run out! Should have been by all rights. Stoinis taps into the covers and Maxwell at the non-striker’s end goes immediately. Stoinis stutters, steps, and stops. Maxwell has to turn back from halway. He’s gone. he’s nowhere. He’s on the slopes after an avalanche. But KL Rahul inexplicably fires a heatseeking throw at the stumps instead of just lobbing back to the bowler Khaleel, who’s standing right there for it. Rahul not only misses but gives away an overthrow that Maxwell is sharp enough to call for. The bowler sends down a couple of wides, gets pulled by Stoinis airly for four into the gap at wide long-on, goes for three more when Kohli misfields at midwicket as the batsmen were hurrying a second, and then gets whacked by Stoinis dead straight and in the air for four more. That’s 14 from the over, and Khaleel has gone for 42 from his three. Might be the end of his night. Australia’s hundred is up.12th over: Australia 90-3 (Maxwell 9, Stoinis 9) Still working the ball around against Krunal, who throws in a wide as well. Plenty of singles, Maxwell cuts a couple, and then Stoinis is given out lbw. He’s been faffing about with a lot of sweeps of all types, and this time he goes for the reverse lap while standing up very straight. Strange sort of shot when he could probably have pulled that shorter ball wherever he wanted. It hit him on the thigh pad dead in front, and Blocker Wilson fired him after some consideration, but height always looked a question and luckily Maxwell runs down to convince Stoinis to review. The replay finds the ball going over the bails.11th over: Australia 83-3 (Maxwell 5, Stoinis 7) Stoinis pulls out the sweep for a couple, then gets a rank short one down leg that he only needs to lap for an easy four. Kuldeep throws his own head back with frustration. Kohli brings in a leg slip for Stoinis, so Stoinis switches to the reverse sweep and gets a run on the other side of the wicket. Maxwell has done away with his helmet with spinners at both ends, and is going MS Dhoni style under lights, bareheaded. Backs away and cuts hard for a single to end the over.There’s that lack of surety against spin. Kuldeep lasering in at Lynn’s pads, and the batsman was through his shot too early. Might have been a top-spinner, seemed to zip straight on towards him, and the batsman stabbed at it. Straight back to the bowler who takes it on his knees, then remains there to accept high-fives as his teammates run in.10th over: Australia 75-2 (Lynn 37, Maxwell 4) Krunal Pandya bowls now, left-arm spin. Another inexperienced player in international terms, just his fourth match for India, but Lynn isn’t so hot against spin as he is against pace. Largely bowling darts to begin with. Maxwell has a look at a couple and then gets off strike. Lynn walks at the bowler to turn a decent ball into a half-volley and drives it cleanly for six. Very straight. Eight from the over.9th over: Australia 67-2 (Lynn 30, Maxwell 3) Glenn Maxwell to the crease, might be a relief for him not having to start an innings in a chase with 80 needed from 38 balls or something like that. He’s being goaded by at least one of the Indian fielders from the moment he arrives. “Come on Maxi!” in a taunting voice. He drives his first ball nicely inside-out through cover for a couple of runs as the sweeper comes around, then adds a single. Just four runs from the over and the Finch wicket, India still on top.Finch wanted to get in on the act. Down the pitch to Kuldeep, looking to boom him over midwicket, but didn’t pick the wrong ‘un and the ball turned away from his blade to take the edge and loop to short third man. Solid from Finch but nowhere near the explosiveness he can produce in this format.8th over: Australia 63-1 (Finch 27, Lynn 29) And if ever there was a hammer-dropper, Chris Lynn is the man. Time to dispense some indiscriminate justice. Tees off at Khaleel, and it drops just on the outside of the rope at deep midwicket. Would have been a catch had there been someone there. But the second six of the over is far sweeter, right out of the thick, and it flies over square leg from a flick shot and into the upper deck of the Gabba. The next ball goes again, six more down the ground from a straight drive that clears the fence despite not being an entirely clean hit. Along with a single and a pulled brace, that makes 21 from the over.7th over: Australia 42-1 (Finch 27, Lynn 8) Kuldeep Yadav, the left-arm wrist-spinner, is on as soon as the fielding restrictions are relaxed. Finch strides forward to sweep, and can’t do more with a low full toss than follow through for a single. Lynn pulls a half-tracker for the same, then Finch drives another full toss for one. Very generous stuff from the Australians. Four singles, then Finch misses the sweep and draws a vocal appeal as the ball hits pad. So many batsmen make the sweep look so fraught. Finch finds the field with the last ball. Six an over exactly from the first seven. Australia desperately need someone to drop the hammer.6th over: Australia 38-1 (Finch 25, Lynn 6) Bhuvneshwar replacing Bumrah as the quicks docie-do. Bowls on the pads to Finch who glances four, then rotates the strike. Lynn aims a lunar-orbit drive at Bhuvi that touches nothing but hydrogen and oxygen. His next makes contact, but only with the inside half of the bat so the ball pings away to the square leg sweeper. The Powerplay ends having yielded only five boundaries and no sixes.5th over: Australia 31-1 (Finch 19, Lynn 5) Chris Lynn to the middle at his home ground where he’s lit up the night sky so often for the Brisbane Heat. Australians would love to see one of his shows tonight. Some of the Indian fans wouldn’t mind it either. He’s stunning to watch when he’s on. He slams Khaleel through cover for an early boundary, but seven runs and the wicket from the over is more than good enough from the young bowler. He’s known for his aggression but was struggling to get going. Khaleel is a left-arm seamer, and his first ball was pitched up. It in the slot for that shot really, so Short had no hesitation in aiming the big lofted drive down the ground. But instead of soaring over the rope it made the clunky plastic sound of bad contact, and went up high instead of long. Kuldeep at mid-on ran back a long way and took a good catch looking back over his shoulder. Dropped! Finch is dropped first ball of Bumrah’s over. Pitched up, drew a booming cover drive and it was neither high nor low. Went straight at Kohli at cover, but very fast and over his head. Kohli got the hands up but not quite closed in time. And so Finch goes on a spree, belting Bumrah down the ground, then squeezing a lucky shot through the gate and down past his stumps to fine leg for a couple of boundaries. Bumrah sends down a hooper that careens past the outside edge, then draws a proper nick from the last ball of the over through a vacant area where slip had been stationed until the prior delivery. Eventful, you might say?3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Short 6, Finch 6) Bhuvneshwar lines up another three dot balls to start his over. The pressure builds so fast. Eventually he drags short, and Finch is able to club away a couple, then a single. Short pulls the last of the over and finally finds the fence. Breathes a sigh of relief. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Short 2, Finch 3) Short still on strike after scoring one run from six balls, and he has another dot from Bumrah as a scrambled delivery gives him no room on off stump. Second up, Short gets a straight ball he can blunt to midwicket for a run. So, two from eight, a slow start to the Powerplay. Finch facing his first ball gets a leading edge straight to cover. Khaleel at midwicket does some soccer work to get the ball to a teammate as Finch works a couple of runs. Short is beaten again from the last of the over. Just five runs from the first dozen balls.1st over: Australia 1-0 (Short 1, Finch 0) Away we go. It’ll be Bhuvi Kumar with the first over, a brilliant exponent of swing, and yet another in the long line-up of fine seamers who don’t bowl much faster than 130 kmh. Australia has been so obsessed with pace for a long time, the idea that everyone must be 140-plus to be a decent bowler, regardless of how many slower types - Kumar, Vernon Philander, Mohammad Abbas, even occasionally the likes of Nuwan Kulasekara or Ajit Agarkar - took them apart. Kumar works over Short in this first over. A couple of defensive shots, a couple of swinging balls that beat the edge, and finally just a single from the sixth delivery.Jasprit Bumrah is the bowler I’m excited to see. Saw him debut in Australia a few summers ago and he was a revelation, with his javelin-hurling front arm and peculiar jerky action. But he was fearsomely accurate and found exacting bounce, and by now he’s added all kinds of tricks when it comes to swing and seam and jagging the ball away from right-handers. Can’t wait to see him in the Tests over a longer period, but he’ll have the four overs tonight to get things going.They much prefer to chase, and they get their way. Here are the teams.Let’s talk venues. For years the main tour of the summer has started off at the Gabba. That’s where we are tonight, but this T20 is the only game India will play here. No Test match. But to debunk all the people loudly claiming that the Test series starts in Adelaide because the BCCI decides everything, the timetable is actually down to Australia’s wish to play day-night Tests. Cricket Australia has committed to at least one, sometimes two such games per season, but it has to be agreed with visiting teams. India declined and Sri Lanka agreed. But the day-night venues as designated by CA are Adelaide and Brisbane. So if the India tour had started in Brisbane for a day match, then Sri Lanka would have had to play in Adelaide. And CA was never going to schedule the smaller drawcard team at one of the biggest venues with one of the best historical attendances. The Melbourne and Sydney Tests are apparently immovable, and Perth can’t do day-night games because its timezone would screw things up on the east coast. So here we are.Come on party people. Put your hands in the air. Come on party people. Wave them like you’re aware of the potentially serious ramifications of one’s actions, but you also don’t believe that a fear of the future should damage one’s enjoyment of the present. It’s party time because the tray of canapes that was South Africa has come and gone, and now we’re down to the flaming cocktails of India. The main event for this cricketing summer. Of course we have to ease into things, so rather than just starting with Test matches from the get-go, we’ll have a Twenty20 series first. This is where it begins.It won’t feature Steven Smith or David Warner, whose bans from playing were not overturned or reduced this week despite lobbying from the players’ union to Cricket Australia. Frankly that didn’t make any sense to me: there wasn’t a strong public appetite to reduce the bans, nor had any injustice been done in handing them out. The players didn’t make any comment supporting the union’s attempt, so you wonder why the players let it proceed at all. Had it won, there would have been a lot of negativity coming their way for not serving out the full time. As it is, the players still look like they tried to wriggle out of consequences, and failed in the attempt. It just wasn’t a smart play all round.So the other Australian cricketers who aren’t those two will turn out tonight, with a strong need to improve their recent results in the shortest format of the game: their last five T20s have included a loss to South Africa, three losses to Pakistan, and a pretty unconvincing win over a pretty unconvincing UAE side. India will be a tough next assignment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05d50908fb9a664398b54f98f22635ccf25574a/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ec7fe8fe663decf1959e47a70ffa3f0","title":"do you work for facebook what is the mood like","story":"We would like to hear from Facebook workers following allegations published last week in the New York TimesMark Zuckerberg has defended his leadership of Facebook, claiming ignorance of the company’s relationship with a PR firm that linked its critics with George Soros.If you work for Facebook, we would like to hear from you about the general mood within the company as you see it, and how things may have changed in light of the allegations.You can get in touch, anonymously if you prefer, using the encrypted form below.

It is always Day 1. Are you ready to make a difference?It was my first day as a seasonal Amazon worker, hired just prior to peak season. Our site operations manager was like many Amazon managers: an ex-military white male, in his late 40s and wearing straight-fit jeans and a T-shirt with “Amazon Military” emblazoned on the front. He drew a line alongside an inverted pyramid, writing “least important” on the bottom and “most important” higher up, with the word “customer” scrawled along the very top.“Where do you think Jeff Bezos sees himself on this chart?”Silence. He points to the bottom of the pyramid.“Jeff sees himself as the least important person in the company. What this company cares about is the customer promise, and putting our customers first.“Where do you think our associates are?”“Here! Jeff sees you at the very top! You, the associates, are the closest to the customers. It is up to you, every day, to uphold our customer promise. As front line associates, you are the most important part of this company!”As I headed to our training session wearing my new orange associate work-vest and wearing my white badge designating me as a “seasonal” employee, I was approached by a co-worker in a fancy, blue and green-lined “Ambassador” vest and a blue badge that signified he has been “converted” to a non-seasonal Amazon worker.“Did they give you the pyramid crap?”“That’s a load of shit.” We laughed, but I wasn’t quite sure I understood.“Welcome to Amazon,” he said.The inverted pyramid has stuck with me as an Amazon fulfillment associate. In some ways it’s on point. It’s important to take a step back and realize what an Amazon fulfillment center really is. Prior to Amazon, the sale of stuff largely took place through physical stores. Enter a store and there can be dozens of employees, stocking shelves, managing the check-out counter, controlling inventory. The pace and rhythm of the day, at least compared to fulfillment centers, can be relatively relaxed.At Amazon, by contrast, we are not retail workers. We are factory workers.A single fulfillment center can contain 1,500-2,000 full-time workers, stowing, picking, packing, unloading, sorting, palletizing and delivering hundreds of thousands of items every day. Centers are filled with the whirl, grind, and moan of conveyor belts, the incessant drone of a forest of Kivabots moving shelves.We work hard, and diligently, to make Amazon run. While our collective efforts produce astounding results, we are supervised ever more intensively. Through the use of digital trackers and indicators, our workday is managed down to the second, with each task timed based on a “rate” set by managers who push us ever faster. Work is often organized to keep workers from talking or even taking breaks, with this time considered “off-task”. Like factory workers on the assembly line, we are essentially extensions of the machine.When you recognize that we are what keeps Amazon going, and the most important part of the business, putting us at the top of the pyramid is right. Workers – whether the engineers or the hundreds of thousands of warehouse employees – are the backbone of the business and the source of astounding wealth. Without us there is no Amazon Prime, no advertising revenue, no streaming video, no HQ2.However, the pyramid analogy is also fitting because at the time this place feels like a pyramid scheme. After a few months at the company, it becomes clear to most of us that management doesn’t regard us a crucial contributors to its success. In reality, they treat us like disposable parts.It doesn’t take long before you’ve see blown backs, boxes falling on people’s heads, carpal tunnel in your coworkers’ wrists, and balky knees that never get better. You’ve seen workers compensation claims repeatedly denied and efforts to address safety issues given low priority. You’ve seen sexism, racism, and ageism in a promotion culture tainted with favoritism. You’ve seen write-ups unfairly distributed and used to manipulate workers. You’ve seen an emotionally toxic culture, where the stress of meeting productivity targets leads managers to treat workers like things, to be pushed harder and faster without regard for the emotional or personal cost. You’ve arrived home exhausted, too worn out to spend time with your kids or friends. And you’ve noticed that the wealth we produce is being accumulated by our boss – the modern world’s richest man – while our wages barely keep us afloat. Amazon’s much-touted new minimum wage of $15 is not enough to propel hundreds of thousands of us into the middle class.Those of us as at the bottom of the pyramid put our bodies and lives on the line, but those at the top of the pyramid are hung out to dry. The closer you are to doing the actual work of making this company run, the more your self-respect is attacked.Every other week, this column will seek to understand the complexity of life inside Amazon, and explore the effects Amazon has on our lives and on our broader community. Throughout, I want to remain consistent on one thing: Amazon workers deserve respect. As the people who make this company run, we are unique. And only if we are united will we be able to transform our company and our communities into the ones we want."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2727049c81d7ae8e12d222c44523fae1ce615bf2/0_325_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed7b3d7d81857b85358cabdaafe0b2e","title":"easter island british museum return moai statue","story":"The museum has held one of the most spiritually important statues of the Chilean island’s stone monoliths for 150 yearsThe governor of Easter Island has tearfully begged the British Museum to return one of its famous statues, saying: “Give us a chance so he can come back.”The museum has held the Hoa Hakananai’a – one of the most spiritually important of the Chilean island’s stone monoliths – for 150 years.“My grandma, who passed away at almost 90 years, she never got the chance to see her ancestor,” said governor Tarita Alarcón Rapu after meeting officials from the British Museum, accompanied by Felipe Ward, Chile’s national assets minister.“I am almost half a century alive and this is my first time,” she added.The four-tonne statue, or “moai”, is one of hundreds originally found on the island.Each of the figures was considered to represent tribal leaders or deified ancestors.It was an emotional moment for the indigenous Rapa Nui visitors when they saw the basalt statue, which for them, contains the spirit of their people.“I believe that my children and their children also deserve the opportunity to touch, see and learn from him,” Rapu said, with tears in his eyes.“We are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul,” she added.Hoa Hakananai’a was taken without permission in 1868 by the British frigate HMS Topaze, captained by Richard Powell, and given to Queen Victoria.The British Museum has faced numerous claims to return artefacts to the countries they originate from, including the Parthenon marbles to Greece and the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.The Rapa Nui people, who last year gained self-administration over their ancestral lands on Easter Island, have launched a campaign to recover what they consider as one of the most important statues of the nearly 900 scattered across the South Pacific island.With its scowling eyes, straight-lined mouth and paunchy profile, the monolith stands at the entrance to a gallery in the British Museum.The moai is distinguished by carvings on the back depicting the island’s birdman cult and other ceremonial aspects of Easter Island’s enigmatic past.The Rapa Nui believe it brought peace to the island, around the year 1000, ending inter-tribal wars.After the meeting, Ward said he was optimistic but cautioned that the campaign for the return of the statue would be a long one.“This is the first of many conversations we will have,” he told reporters at the museum.“We are looking forward to the next, and probably the second one will be in Rapa Nui (Easter Island), where we invited the authorities of the museum.”It is the first time that the British Museum, which holds cultural treasures from around the globe, has agreed to hold talks about the statue. But on Tuesday the museum was talking only of a loan, not the return, on the artefact.“The museum is one of the world’s leading lenders and the trustees will always consider loan requests subject to usual conditions,” a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b854be00205da69cc353f70d5e8f806a574a1b4/0_77_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=360054ae12ba877e5d1aaa8a76d71a68","title":"interpol elects south korean president russia kim jong yang","story":"Kim Jong-yang defeats Alexander Prokopchuk, who was opposed by US and others over fears Moscow could abuse roleSouth Korea’s Kim Jong-yang has been elected as Interpol’s next president, edging out a longtime veteran of Russia’s security services who was strongly opposed by the US, Britain and other European nations.The White House and its European partners had lobbied against Alexander Prokopchuk’s attempts to be named the next president of the international police body, saying his election would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol’s “red notice” system to go after political opponents.Prokopchuk is a general in the Russian interior ministry and serves as an Interpol vice-president.Kim was chosen by Interpol’s 94 member states at a meeting of its annual congress in Dubai. He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Meng Hongwei, who went missing in his native China in September. Beijing later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes.Critics say that Prokopchuk oversaw a policy of systematically targeting critics and dissidents during his time in charge of the Russian office of Interpol. The Ukrainian interior minister, Arsen Avakov, tweeted from the conference room where the vote was held, saying: “The Russian candidate has been rejected. This battle is won!”On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, threw his weight behind Kim, who is the acting president of the global police body. “We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr Kim will be just that,” Pompeo told reporters.Yang had been serving as Interpol’s acting president since Meng resigned and was a vice-president representing Asia. “Our world is now facing unprecedented changes which present huge challenges to public security and safety,” Yang said after he was elected. “To overcome them, we need a clear vision: we need to build a bridge to the future.”The 57-year-old was previously the chief of police in South Korea’s most populous province, and is a high-profile proponent of the Korean government’s push to export its policing strategies, known as the “K-cop wave”.Bill Browder, a British-American financier who has campaigned for western countries to implement sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights abuses, said on Tuesday that Prokopchuk had been in charge of Russia’s Interpol bureau at a time when Moscow repeatedly tried to have red notice arrest warrants issued for him through the organisation. The central Interpol body rescinded the warrants, believing them to be politically motivated.“There is probably no more inappropriate person than this person and there’s no more inappropriate country to have any kind of leadership position at Interpol than Russia,” he said at a press conference in London.On Wednesday morning, Browder tweeted that “reason had prevailed”.Marina Litvinenko, the widow of poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Tuesday night that having a Russian as president of Interpol would lead to abuse of the red notice system. “Everybody who is asking for political asylum here in the UK now will not feel safe at all,” she said.British officials made it clear that they were backing Yang, and expressed alarm at the prospect of Prokopchuk taking over.

Alexander Prokopchuk is accused of trying to use the agency to target dissidents and critics of Vladimir Putin’s government. The Interpol general assembly is due to vote on the presidency today in Dubai.“There is probably no more inappropriate person than this person, and there’s no more inappropriate country to have any kind of leadership position at Interpol than Russia,” said Bill Browder, a British-American financier who says he was politically targeted by Russia and Prokopchuk via Interpol.British officials have made it clear that they don’t want Prokopchuk and are backing South Korean Kim Jong Yang for the presidency. “This is really quite an extraordinary situation,” said Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP and foreign affairs committee chair, “to find ourselves with the possibility of not just a fox in charge of the hen coop, but actually the assassin in charge of the murder investigation.”Interpol’s previous chief, China’s Meng Hongwei, was arrested during a visit home in September as part of a corruption investigation.‘Barbaric act defying civilised norms’ – Donald Trump has launched an extraordinary defence of Saudi Arabia – repeating the kingdom’s description of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi as an “enemy of the state” while claiming, in the face of reported CIA assessments, that there is “nothing definitive” linking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the killing. Blaming the crown prince might make oil prices go up, warned Trump, who also repeated his exaggerations of the scale of US arms deals with the Saudis. But Lindsey Graham – normally a fervent Trump fan – predicted “strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilised norms”, and called the crown prince “beyond toxic”. Nicholas Burns, an under-secretary of state in the George Bush administration, called Trump’s statement “beyond embarrassing. It is shameful.

Government guidance cautions against the use of paroxetine and venlafaxine in young people but they are still being prescribed as a last resort. Andrea Cipriani, an Oxford psychiatrist, carried out a study that found no antidepressant apart from Prozac, the recommended drug, was any better than a placebo in treating children and teenagers. But Dr Louise Theodosiou, a member of the child and adolescent psychiatry faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says allergies or other problems might necessitate the use of alternatives. “It’s really important that people are not frightened of the prospect of medication. What we wouldn’t want is a situation where people thought these medications were inherently dangerous.”Coco’s revenge – Kellogg’s has won a battle to use Coco Pops’ mascot monkey to advertise chocolate-flavoured granola. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) had banned the TV ad campaign for breaking rules against advertising junk food to children. But Kellogg’s argued it was allowable to use a character normally associated with a sugary product to advertise a healthy one. The ASA reversed its ban after an independent review. Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance condemned the reversal: “This is just another example of why we need strong government action to protect children from unhealthy food marketing, starting with a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV.” But Kellogg’s said the ban, if left in place, would have been “a disincentive for food companies like us to develop and launch ‘better for you’ alternatives at a time when people are looking to our industry to take action.”In 2010 a plane crash in Russia killed Poland’s president and plunged the country’s prime ministership into crisis.

But critics say that populists in power often subvert democratic norms, whether by undermining the media and judiciary or by trampling minority rights.Populists tend to frame politics as a battle between the virtuous \u0027ordinary\u0027 masses and a nefarious or corrupt elite – and insist that the general will of the people must always triumph.  is adopting the classic definition of populism proposed by political scientist Cas Mudde. Populism, he says, is often combined with a \u0027host\u0027 ideology, which can either be on the left or right.Against the backdrop of increasing populist vote share and influence, the  is launching a six-month investigative series to explore who the new populists are, what factors brought them to power, and what they are doing once in office.The findings of the study come six months before European parliamentary elections that some are predicting could return more rightwing populists than ever to the 751-seat chamber.It reveals the different fortunes of rightwing populists such Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Matteo Salvini, who have had the most success in recent years, and leftwing populist parties, which rapidly expanded in the aftermath of the financial crisis but failed to secure a seat in government anywhere other than Greece. In order to track the success of populist parties in Europe, Rooduijn and the  worked with political scholars to examine hundreds of political parties and decide whether or not they were populist at different stages over the past 20 years. National election results since 1998 were then mapped on to the party definitions to show trends over time.The map shows how populism flickered across the continent in the late 1990s before really catching on in eastern Europe throughout the 2000s. It spread north in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis before making substantial inroads in western Europe’s major powerhouses in the past three years.Europe is not alone in experiencing this rise: populists have been elected to executive office in five of the world’s seven biggest democracies: India, the US, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. Populist parties enjoyed success in Norway, Switzerland and Italy in the 1990s. But it was not until the turn of the century that populist ideas, legislators and challengers started to proliferate, from the Netherlands to France, Hungary to Poland.The research shows that leftwing populists, which in Europe are far less successful than their conservative counterparts, have begun increasing their share of the vote in national elections, giving rise to challenger parties such as Podemos in Spain and La France Insoumise. Claudia Alvares, an associate professor at Lusofona University in Lisbon, who was not involved in the  research project, said: “The success of such politicians has very much to do with their capacity to convince their audiences that they do not belong to the traditional political system. As such, they are on a par with the people to the extent that neither they nor the people belong to the ‘corrupt’ elites.”She said social media had a role to play in the rise of populism, its algorithmic model rewarding and promoting adversarial messages. “The anger that populist politicians manage to channel is fuelled by social media posts, because social media are very permeable to the easy spread of emotion. The end result is a rise in the polarisation of political and journalistic discourse.”While the overall trend in Europe shows a dramatic rise in populist vote share, the picture remains nuanced. In Belgium, for example, the populist Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang has been in decline for a decade. And populist parties that enter government – and are, of necessity, forced to compromise on their promises – can find life hard. Continent-wide, however, the picture is unambiguous: 12.5 million Europeans lived in a country with at least one populist cabinet member in 1998 in 2018, that has risen more than tenfold, to 170.2 million.As for the future, elections in the first half of 2019 will provide further scope to chart the rise and rise of populism, from Ukraine to Denmark, Finland to Belgium.“In the short term, populist parties will probably stay roughly this strong, although they will be even more clearly radical right and there will remain significant regional and national differences,” said Mudde. “The main question is how non-populist parties are responding.”To conduct the research, the  enlisted the help of more than 30 political scientists to assess which European parties could be considered populist, under academic definitions of the word, at various points over the past 20 years. Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at the University of Amsterdam, oversaw the project, and made the final decision on all party classifications.The full methodology can be found here along with the list of academics who reviewed the study.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar accused Mary Lou McDonald of “hobnobbing with the super-rich” in New York on Armistice day. He was responding in the Dáil to the Sinn Féin leader who had accused the Government of favouring the superrich while cutting flat rate expenses worth €100 a year for low paid workers.Ms McDonald said the Taoiseach claimed at his party’s ardfheis he would deliver five years of tax cuts but he never said that tens of thousands of low paid workers would lose their entitlement to flat rate expenses, worth an average of €100 a year from January 1st next year.She said the group affected included “people like panel beaters, kitchen porters, nurses and members of the Defence Forces”. She said “shop assistants, the group worst affected, some 75,822 will lose €120 a year and that’s a net saving to the exchequer of €9 million a year”.She said “ordinary workers fall to the bottom of the pile” of the Government’s priorities compared to the super wealthy.She also said there were nearly 500 people with wealth of €50 million and in 2015 that cohort “claimed €93 million in tax credits, a great multiple of that claimed by low paid workers”.She added that €45 million of that was for expenses such as furniture. Ending breaks for banks would deliver €175 million and ending tax breaks for multinationals for onshore intangible assets would raise €750 million.Mr Varadkar said it would have no impact on people’s incomes next year and would not come into effect until January 2020 “if at all”.The Taoiseach stressed “all employees will still be able to claim for vouched expenses” and said it was part of a move away from flat-rate to vouched expenses.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe later confirmed in the Dáil that the Revenue Commissioners will carry out a review of tax relief on expenses next year but there will be no changes until January 2020.Some 80,000 workers were expected to lose the tax relief on flat rate, unvouched expenses and a majority of those workers, over 75,000 retail employees would lose an average of €120 a year, from January 1st next year.However during debate on the Finance Bill Mr Donohoe said “expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily included for the purposes of work will continue to be claimable under the Tax Consolidation Act and that is not changing”.He said however that “the matter will be reviewed”. Revenue had told him that there would be no changes on how they implement this policy until January 2020, he said.Earlier Mr Varadkar criticised Ms McDonald and questioned Sinn Féin’s relationship with the superrich.Ms McDonald said that on November 14th she attended a remembrance day service at Sligo Grammar, an event all leaders were invited to, and paid her respects there.She said the Taoiseach’s response amplified his position on tax relief for corporates but a very different view was taken for retail workers.“Can you for once empathise and put yourself in the place of retail workers?”“We see Sinn Féin trying to claim that they can put themselves in the shop workers’ shoes, when we know for years and years and years they told porkies about their own salaries, that they were living on the average industrial wage.”He said the Government was clamping down on tax breaks and tax evasion left, right and centre, including the exit tax and closing off the double Irish.Mark Guilfoyle, president of Sinn Féin’s US fundraising arm, declined to comment on the Taoiseach’s remarks about the Friends of Sinn Féin annual dinner in New York but said that it was held on November 8th - three days before Armistice Day, the day Mr Varadkar said it took place.He would not be drawn on the Taoiseach’s characterisation of the party’s guests as being “super-rich.” He would only say that it was “another successful event” hosted by the organisation. Declining to reveal the sum raised at the event, Mr Guilfoyle, a Cincinnati-based lawyer, said the group would publish financial details around the event in its biannual filings to the US Department of Justice as a foreign agent of Sinn Féin as required under US law. That filing, which will be made in mid-2019, will list the names of donors who attended the annual dinner, Sinn Féin’s most lucrative fundraiser every year in the US, and the amounts raised as well as the group’s expenditure in the six-month reporting period from November to April 2019. “We do value transparency, and the Justice Department filing is the best vehicle for delivering on transparency,” Mr Guilfoyle told The .The group will publish a filing in the coming weeks covering the reporting period between May and October 2018.Mr Guilfoyle directed queries around Mr Varadkar’s political comments to Sinn Féin.In the six-month fundraising period covering last year’s fundraising dinner in New York, Friends of Sinn Féin raised $309,802 (€265,000) and spent $365,500. Some $143,900 was spent on fundraising event expenses, mostly relating to the New York dinner."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3705349.1542785341!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may under tory pressure ahead of meeting with juncker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of meeting on October 17th. Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersFileBritish prime minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet the European Union’s top official under pressure from Tory Brexiteers to secure further concessions.Ms May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks ahead of the special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.She is under pressure to make changes to the Northern Irish backstop contained in the Brexit orce agreement, making it clear how the UK can exit the controversial arrangement.The trip to Brussels, and another potentially tricky session of prime minister’s questions, come amid mounting evidence of tensions between Ms May and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) over the Brexit deal.The British government caved in to a series of opposition amendments to its Budget-enacting finance Bill in the latest sign that DUP MPs would not support Ms May’s minority administration.Ms May’s talks with Mr Juncker follow confirmation from Number 10 that the British government will look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish Border open.Ms May’s official spokesman confirmed that references in last week’s draft agreement to “alternative arrangements” for the Border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the “maximum facilitation” solution, or Max Fac.Brexiteer ministers want her to press for clarity on how the UK can avoid or end the use of the backstop, which would require the whole UK to be in a single customs territory with the EU and force Northern Ireland to align with many of the EU’s single market rules after 2020 unless an alternative is found.A Brexit-backing minister said that the negotiation process was “not over until it’s over” and it was now a case of “who blinks first” as the EU did not want either the backstop to be implemented or the prospect of the UK crashing out without a deal.Brussels has indicated that the withdrawal agreement, setting out the terms of the UK’s orce from the bloc, will not be rewritten — although work is ongoing to flesh out the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Dáil: “This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government.“So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it’s now the text, and it is not going to be reopened.”The Brexit deal has angered the DUP and jeopardised the confidence and supply deal which props up Ms May’s minority government.After a DUP revolt in the House of Commons on Monday, the British government accepted a series of amendments on Tuesday without votes to avoid a repeat.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: “We have kept to our word in relation to the confidence and supply agreement, but even cabinet members have found themselves having to resign because this deal does not represent those shared objectives in relation to the Union.“The government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom. ”Leading Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson — a prominent critic of Ms May’s approach – is expected to address the DUP’s conference at the weekend.In a sign that the government is seeking to keep its arrangement with the DUP alive, chancellor Philip Hammond is also expected to attend the gathering in Belfast, according to the Impartial Reporter.But Labour claimed the DUP’s approach meant the UK government was on the brink of collapse.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “It’s absolutely staggering that the Government has accepted all Labour amendments to the finance Bill because it couldn’t rely upon the DUP’s support.“The Tories are in office but not in power. We’re watching a government falling apart in front of us.”The DUP may have given the prime minister a political headache, but she appears to have averted an immediate challenge to her position from Tory critics.The attempt to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership spearheaded by Jacob Rees-Mogg has so far failed to win enough support.Last week, senior figures from the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of Tories were confidently predicting they would get the 48 letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Ms May’s leadership.But ERG chairman Mr Rees-Mogg acknowledged they were struggling to get the support they needed and warned Tory MPs that unless they acted now, Ms May would lead the party into the next general election despite a lack of enthusiasm for that prospect within the Conservative ranks.“You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised,” he said.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Russian Interior MinistryHandout via ReutersSouth Korea’s Kim Jong Yang has been elected as Interpol’s next president, edging out a veteran of Russia’s security services who was strongly opposed by the US, Britain and other European nations.The White House and its European partners had lobbied against Alexander Prokopchuk’s attempts to be named the next president of the policing organisation, saying his election would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol’s red notice system to go after political opponents.Mr Prokopchuk is a general in the Russian Interior Ministry and serves as an Interpol vice president.Mr Kim’s win means he secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol’s general assembly in Dubai on Wednesday.He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China. Prior to the vote,Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said he could not imagine how a Russian candidate could be seen fit to head Interpol. “Russia has an unimpressive record of practising the rule of law at home and a proven track record of abusing red notices and diffusions for political purposes,” he tweeted.Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Russian oil oligarch who now lives in exile in Europe, said he was sure that if Mr Prokopchuk became head of Interpol he would use his position to “serve the interests of the Kremlin” without “concern for his reputation”.The ballot in Dubai was a secret one in which Ireland was represented by the Garda assistant commissioner Michael O’Sullivan, the force’s head of security and intelligence.The Department of Justice told The  it was for the Garda to decide who to vote for.In reply to queries, Garda headquarters said that “in order to respect the process of electing the interim president of Interpol it would not be appropriate for An Garda Síochána to discuss its voting intention”. - Additional reporting AP"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

case rat hepatitis humans discovered hong kong","story":"Hong Kong is one of many world cities that have to live with a large rat populationA 70-year-old woman in Hong Kong has been infected with rat hepatitis, making the city home to the world’s only two known cases of the virus jumping from rodents to humans.Scientists found the case while testing blood samples of patients who previously contracted the hepatitis E virus after discovering an initial case of the rat version in humans a few months ago.The cases have raised concern that humans are susceptible to contracting the disease via rats. “It’s not a one-off thing – it can jump to humans, and the people who seem to be susceptible are iniduals with weak immunity,” said Dr Siddharth Sridhar, a microbiology professor at the University of Hong Kong, one of the scientists who discovered the two rat-to-human hepatitis cases. “Rats are very versatile – they’re basically all over the world, and Hong Kong is no exception.”He said it was important for city officials to focus on controlling the rodent population, doctors to test patients for the rat hepatitis variety, and the public to be careful in eating properly prepared food.Experts announced the first case, found in a 56-year-old man, in September. The patient had undergone a liver transplant surgery in May 2017, and subsequently developed abnormal liver symptoms. Clinical tests later showed that he had contracted the rat hepatitis virus. Researchers ruled out infection via his blood and organ donors. Instead, they found his housing complex had piles of rubbish and evidence of rodent infestation, including droppings.The patient was cured over a few months with the help of antiviral drugs, though it is likely it took longer given his weakened immune system after surgery. In the most recent instance, the woman’s symptoms cleared within weeks and didn’t require medication.Both were believed to have been infected in 2017, and lived in the same Hong Kong neighbourhoods. However, scientists haven’t found a direct link between the two cases.Like many other cities around the world, Hong Kong officials have long battled rats, which were described to one local paper as being “as big as kittens.”Hepatitis affects the liver and is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water – for instance, by eating under-cooked meat or coming into contact with unclean water.The specific strain, hepatitis E, infects around 20 million people a year and is most prevalent in East and South Asia, according to the World Health Organisation.Symptoms can vary from mild discomfort to very severe some infections become life-threatening.The rat version, first discovered in 2010 in Germany, has a “very significant genetic difference” from the strains typically known to infect humans up until now, Dr Sridhar said.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May heads to Brussels amid pressure to improve her dealSNP\u0026#39s Hannah Bardell shows off her football skills in the House of CommonsChildren admitted to hospital with stab wounds up 86 per cent in four years, new analysis shows\u0026#39Somali\u0026#39 gunmen abduct Italian aid worker during shootout in KenyaRussian candidate for Interpol presidency defeated after intense lobbying from Western alliesTerror attack victims let down by NHS mental health servicesViolence against police glorified by filming for social media, says top officerPrue Leith: political correctness plays no part in selecting bake off hopefulsTrapped bear cub freed from skip by police in CaliforniaSome 85,000 children in Yemen may have died from hunger, charity findsPolitical activist Harry Leslie Smith seriously ill in hospitalComment: We could learn a thing or two from Pompeii\u0026#39s saucy muralsClement Attlee took in Jewish child refugee before Second World WarComment: Why an EU army could be the final nail in Europe\u0026#39s defence cooperation with AmericaBangladesh photographer Shahidul Alam freed after months in detentionWashed up whale had 115 plastic cups and 2 flip-flops in its stomachDonald Trump \u0026#39wanted the justice department to investigate Hillary Clinton and James Comey\u0026#39DUP orders MPs to ignore pact to vote with Conservatives after withdrawing Budget supportVintage poster that once hung alongside the dance floor at Annabel\u0026#39s nightclub has sold for a record £193,750 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/02/TELEMMGLPICT000179625857_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"should get free tv licence time public decide","story":"Should the licence fee be scrapped altogether?The BBC has started a big conversation with the public about the future of free TV licences for older people.

including 17 caravans - entered Thwaites Brewery in Blackburn after one of the group used a chainsaw to cut a lock on a pedestrian entrance and then opened the main gates on the evening of May 26.A spokesman for the travellers allegedly told brewery bosses: Twenty grand or the place is ours.Thomas Ward, 43, of Aspull Common, Leigh, Greater Manchester, initially demanded £20,000 from Thwaites to leave within the hour before he settled on a handshake to take payment at noon the following day provided no damage was caused, jurors at Preston Court were told.But prosecutors say travellers went on a wrecking spree and ransacked the office building later that afternoon after Ward formed the view his demand would not be met.Staff and police finally gained full access to the brewery on May 28 and Thwaites chief executive Richard Bailey said he was greeted by a scene of utter devastation, with extensive damage estimated at £300,000.The travellers finally left later the same day under police escort, the court heard.The travellers caused £300,000 worth of damage at the brewery, jurors were toldWith a brewing heritage that stretches back over 200 years, Thwaites sells its beer exclusively in its chain of pubs, hotels, inns and lodges.In 2001, Prince Charles toasted Thwaites Beers at Craven Heifer, Stainforth and in 2005 the company signed cricketer Andrew Flintoff to become the face of their ‘Lancaster bomber’ as he helped England win the Ashes.On Tuesday, Ward pleaded guilty to blackmail, conspiracy to burgle Thwaites and conspiracy to commit criminal damage.John Ward, 33, also of Aspull Common, and a 17-year-old male, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted the conspiracy offences.A fourth defendant, Patrick Ward, 32, of Aspull Common, who has pleaded not guilty to the same conspiracy offences, is on trial at Preston Crown Court in his absence.Jurors heard that a security guard on duty at Thwaites rang management to say they had a major problem after the travellers broke in.In a statement to the court, Mr Bailey said when he arrived he saw a large number of travellers and vehicles in the yard.Dog kennels had already been laid out in what was clearly an advanced stage of encampment.Work contractor Greg Hartley had already discussed with Big John, a spokesman for the travellers, his terms for them leaving, said Mr Bailey.Mr Hartley said: Big John said give me 20 grand and we\u0027ll be gone in the next hour.He said he relayed the message to Mr Bailey and explained to Big John it was not possible to obtain any money immediately.They finally agreed on a handshake for a noon handover as Big John reminded him: Twenty grand or the place is ours, he continued.On May 27, Thwaites were allowed into the premises - with police assistance - to remove a number of valuable items, including artwork and memorabilia worth £2 million.A number of males were seen to trespass the office building in a horsebox and a beer dray, at around 4:30pm.The CCTV - which also showed young children playing in the yard - stopped recording when the power was cut on site at about 5.50pm, the court heard.Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said it was the Crown\u0027s case that Patrick Ward was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery.Jurors were told that Patrick Ward denies it was him, although he does accept he was in the area at nearby Morrisons supermarket and Gala Bingo on May 27.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May heads to Brussels amid pressure to improve her dealSNP\u0026#39s Hannah Bardell shows off her football skills in the House of CommonsChildren admitted to hospital with stab wounds up 86 per cent in four years, new analysis shows\u0026#39Somali\u0026#39 gunmen abduct Italian aid worker during shootout in KenyaRussian candidate for Interpol presidency defeated after intense lobbying from Western alliesTerror attack victims let down by NHS mental health servicesViolence against police glorified by filming for social media, says top officerPrue Leith: political correctness plays no part in selecting bake off hopefulsTrapped bear cub freed from skip by police in CaliforniaSome 85,000 children in Yemen may have died from hunger, charity findsPolitical activist Harry Leslie Smith seriously ill in hospitalComment: We could learn a thing or two from Pompeii\u0026#39s saucy muralsClement Attlee took in Jewish child refugee before Second World WarComment: Why an EU army could be the final nail in Europe\u0026#39s defence cooperation with AmericaBangladesh photographer Shahidul Alam freed after months in detentionWashed up whale had 115 plastic cups and 2 flip-flops in its stomachDonald Trump \u0026#39wanted the justice department to investigate Hillary Clinton and James Comey\u0026#39DUP orders MPs to ignore pact to vote with Conservatives after withdrawing Budget supportVintage poster that once hung alongside the dance floor at Annabel\u0026#39s nightclub has sold for a record £193,750 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000181417055_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqtv-I6z4jcjRiRj6jQUzi-ghS1oqezwFutXOUZ9-cDhE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"could learn thing two pompeiis saucy murals","story":"This erotic fresco of Leda and the swan has just been discovered in PompeiiAn exquisite ancient fresco has just been discovered by archaeologists in the Roman city of Pompeii. It shows Leda, a legendary queen of Sparta, in flagrante with a swan, but you would be forgiven for thinking she was merely petting the bird, or at least allowing it to rest in her lap, such is the subtlety of the image. Yes, she is practically naked – and is that a knowing look in her dark eyes? – but it’s telling that the painting has proved shocking to some modern eyes. The Romans found a beauty in sexual love that we have forgotten how to express.The remarkably intact fresco, which is thought to have been painted in a bedroom, was found in a villa on the Via dei Vesuvio.

a Russian interior ministry official and current Interpol vice president - over fears Moscow could abuse the role to target political opponents.On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw his weight behind Kim, who will serve out Meng\u0027s term until 2020.We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that, Pompeo told reporters.Critics have raised concerns over Russia\u0027s previous applications for Interpol Red Notices, or international arrest warrants, to target those who have fallen foul of the Kremlin.Interpol\u0027s president chairs its General Assembly while day-to-day operations are handled by the organisation\u0027s Secretary general Juergen Stock.In an open letter this week, a bipartisan group of US senators said choosing Prokopchuk would be like putting a fox in charge of a henhouse.Russia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists, they wrote.Harriett Baldwin, a minister of state at the British foreign office, told parliament on Tuesday that London would support Kim\u0027s bid.The controversy also comes amid security concerns over accusations of Russian agents attempting to poison an ex-spy in Britain and trying to hack the network of the global chemical weapons watchdog.Ukraine, deeply at odds with Moscow over its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists, threatened to pull out of Interpol if Prokopchuk prevailed. Lithuania also said it would consider withdrawing from the network.Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the US senators\u0027 letter as a vivid example of an attempt to interfere in the vote.Moscow\u0027s interior ministry denounced a foreign media campaign aimed at discrediting Russia\u0027s candidate.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May heads to Brussels amid pressure to improve her dealSNP\u0026#39s Hannah Bardell shows off her football skills in the House of CommonsChildren admitted to hospital with stab wounds up 86 per cent in four years, new analysis shows\u0026#39Somali\u0026#39 gunmen abduct Italian aid worker during shootout in KenyaTerror attack victims let down by NHS mental health servicesViolence against police glorified by filming for social media, says top officerPrue Leith: political correctness plays no part in selecting bake off hopefulsTrapped bear cub freed from skip by police in CaliforniaSome 85,000 children in Yemen may have died from hunger, charity findsPolitical activist Harry Leslie Smith seriously ill in hospitalComment: We could learn a thing or two from Pompeii\u0026#39s saucy muralsClement Attlee took in Jewish child refugee before Second World WarComment: Why an EU army could be the final nail in Europe\u0026#39s defence cooperation with AmericaBangladesh photographer Shahidul Alam freed after months in detentionWashed up whale had 115 plastic cups and 2 flip-flops in its stomachDonald Trump \u0026#39wanted the justice department to investigate Hillary Clinton and James Comey\u0026#39DUP orders MPs to ignore pact to vote with Conservatives after withdrawing Budget supportVintage poster that once hung alongside the dance floor at Annabel\u0026#39s nightclub has sold for a record £193,750 Gambling more common among teenagers than drinking, smoking or taking drugsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/20/19/amazon-disney-0.jpg","title":"amazon disney sports networks channels bid basketball american football yankees latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsSources say networks may be worth $20bnClick to followThe IndependentAmazon has reportedly submitted bids to buy nearly two-dozen sports networks from Disney - a move that would help the technology and E-commerce giant expand its footprint in coverage of the sporting world.Disney is being forced to sell off a slew of networks, among them the YES Network, which broadcasts New York Yankees games, as part of its deal $71.3bn deal with Twenty-First Century Fox.CNBC said Amazon was among several organisations that had submitted bids for 22 networks, that show a variety of professional leagues, including Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.Best Black Friday Amazon deals of 2018It said other bidders included KKR, Sinclair Broadcasting Group and the Blackstone Group.

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The hall is ided in two, with rows of seats facing each other, adversarially. But the first recipient of the Stephen Hawking Fellowship, apart from the professor himself who gave the initial Fellowship speech last year, was anything but combative.Sir Jonathan Ive, Chief Design Officer at Apple, was awarded the fellowship because he fulfilled its twin criteria, as explained by Charles Connor, President of the Cambridge Union for the Michalemas term. Connor said Ive showed flair in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields and the ability to communicate complex ideas in a way to excite the imagination.Jony Ive, as everyone calls him, made a speech that was intellectually rich but still accessible, dense with ideas and fascinating. He spoke eloquently, gently, even tenderly, about the creative process and the importance of listening to the quietest voice. Throughout, he was open and humble, repeatedly revealing the curiosity which is a central part of doing his work.Jony Ive addressed an audience of mostly students at the Cambridge Union on 19 November, 2018 (Apple)The Union’s main hall holds around 400. It was packed, mostly with students. Ive stood in the dead centre of the hall, turning back and forth between the facing rows, elegantly but quietly dressed in an immaculate blue suit, pale blue shirt and tie.We designers create tools, tools that you can live in, sit on, eat with, tools that enable communication and support learning, creating and mending. Our tools can be powerful, they can be beautiful, and on many occasions they\u0027re not motivated by understood or articulated needs.But though Ive works in the world of technology, he recognises it can be challenging.As an aside, it\u0027s interesting, isn\u0027t it, when we struggle with technology, we assume the issue is actually with us. If you eat something that tastes dreadful, you don\u0027t assume that the issue is with you.

Firstly, I could actually use it. I loved using it and it became a very powerful tool that helped me design and create. Secondly, and I think this is in some ways a rather embarrassing admission because this was at the end of four years of studying design, I realised that what you make represents who you are.It stands testament to your values and your preoccupations, and using the Mac I sensed a clear and direct connection with the people who actually created the Macintosh. For the first time, I remember being moved by obvious humanity and care beyond just the functional imperative. This, he said, led to him finding out more about the people at Apple and moving to California in 1992 to join the team.Jony Ive was awarded the 2018 Professor Hawking Fellowship (Apple)But his most interesting thoughts concerned creativity and the nature of ideas. I spend my time at Apple in that intersection of art and technology. I think that, almost by definition, ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, if they were robust, they wouldn\u0027t be ideas any more, they would be shipping products, a finished album, a completed building. I\u0027m not really entirely sure why, but I think I\u0027ve always taken an enormous delight when the most tentative thought, often from the quietest voice, evolves into significant and substantial products.As he described the process that surrounded one interface project which began in around 2002 to 2003, he intriguingly revealed that the concept of the Apple App Store began a long time ago.This was a project that we came to describe as multi-touch. Some of you may remember the first time you experienced the interface. Perhaps it was on one of the first iPhones or later on an iPad. But multi-touch describes the ability to directly touch and interact with your content to be able to pinch to zoom an image or flick through a list with your fingers.Importantly, it defined an opportunity to create applications with their own unique, very specific interface. So, not being generic but being specific inherently describes the application\u0027s function. We came to see that we could make applications purposeful, compelling and intuitive to use. And so, as the potential for a vast range of apps became clear, so did the idea for an app store.But it took time before it could happen: In reality, the supporting technology, the enabling technology, took years to catch up with the ideas. And I have to say the ideas posed problems and defined challenges, but in the process, we came close to giving up on a number of occasions.Thankfully, they didn\u0027t give up. But ideas, he said, were not in response to a defined problems. Nobody asked us to solve a problem. They were not in response to a technological opportunity. These ideas, they weren\u0027t vulnerable or fragile for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months, these ideas were fragile for years.Still, after nearly 30 years at Apple, he is eager to create. I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredicability and the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there\u0027s nothing. There is no idea, there is no conversation, the room is silent, there\u0027s certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday?Collaboration is a key element, he said, even if this can lead to complexities. Without doubt, collaborating closely with multiple experts from different disciplines is one of my favorite aspects of being part of the team at Apple but this does present challenges that are a function of working as a large group. As a larger group, opinions often become confused with ideas. Opinions expressed in larger groups tend to focus on what is measurable, tangible and can be easily evaluated and communicated. That\u0027s why there\u0027s an obsession with attributes like size and weight and speed, capacity, schedule or price. But there often follows the dangerous assumption: we talk about these attributes because we think they\u0027re important.Apple\u0027s Jony Ive on how he created the But, common vision and shared purpose, Ive says, is not enough. When we genuinely look at a problem it\u0027s an opportunity to learn together, and we discover something together. We know that learning in community is powerful. It feeds and supports momentum which in turn encourages a familiarity and an acceptance of challenges associated with doing difficult things. And I\u0027ve come to learn that I think a desire to learn makes doing something new just a little less scary.He also described a paradox in the way he works which, he says, almost becomes absurd.There is a fundamental conflict between two very different ways of thinking. It is the conflict between curiosity and the resolve and focus that is necessary to solve problems. Curiosity, while it fuels and motivates, despite being utterly fundamental to the generation of ideas, in isolation just culminates in lots of long lists, perhaps some ideas, but alone that\u0027s sort of where it ends.The necessary resolve to find solutions to the problems that stand between a tentative thought and something substantial, that resolve and that focus very often seems in direct conflict with most creative behaviour. Honestly, I can\u0027t think of two ways of working, two different ways of being, that are more polar. On one hand to be constantly questioning, loving surprises, consumed with curiosity and yet on the other hand having to be utterly driven and completely focused to solve apparently insurmountable problems, even if those solutions are without precedent or reference. And so, of course, this is where it becomes sort of ironic and teeters towards the utterly absurd.You see, in the mode of being unreasonable and resolute, you have to solve hard problems. But solving those problems requires new ideas. And so, we\u0027re back to needing ideas and back to having to be open and curious. This is not a shift that occurs once or twice in a multi-year project. I find it happens to me once or twice a day and that frequency of shifting between two such different ways of seeing and thinking is fantastically demanding.He ended by quoting Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple, with whom he had a deep and incredibly fruitful creative relationship. As he read Jobs’ words, he slowed, seeming moved, as if hearing the words anew.I\u0027m going to read you something that my close friend and collaborator, the remarkable Steve Jobs, said about 10 years ago. I thought to conclude with his words rather than mine seemed entirely fitting. \u0027There\u0027s lots of ways to be as a person. People express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours but somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there.

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks. Mars bars could run out in ‘weeks’ in the event of a no-deal BrexitNHS faces £2.3bn cost of no-deal Brexit, report warnsIgnore the hot air from cabinet members about a no-deal BrexitThe Bank’s Financial Stability Report will be published alongside the results of the stress tests on Wednesday, 28 December. They were previously scheduled to be released on 5 December. The timing has been changed to allow politicians to look over the Bank’s assessment before any parliamentary votes on Brexit. The Treasury Select Committee has previously asked the Bank to look at the scenario of transition to World Trade Organisation trading terms for the UK , which would be the default in the event of no deal.The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, told the TSC on Tuesday: “The question has to be: in 20 months would we be ready to have in place all the customs arrangements…that are necessary for a WTO trading relationship with the European Union? A transition to WTO could look like no-deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of no-deal was high, and when asked whether the chance of a no-deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Virgin Money and CYBG strike £1.7bn deal putting 1,500 jobs at riskCYBG set for Virgin merger but consumers shouldn’t get too excitedThe shares sell-off wasn’t just about brexit. The bank fell into a pre-tax loss for the year to the end of September, thanks largely to\u0026nbspa much bigger than expected provision to cover the cost of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) misselling. Shore Capital had hoped for a better idend than was offered too.\u0026nbspThe baleful influence of Brexit, however, exacerbated the negatives in the bank’s numbers.\u0026nbspShortly after the EU referendum in June 2016,\u0026nbspCYBG held a capital markets day when the banking group\u0026nbspsaid it expected the impact of the leave vote to be felt 18 to 24 months down the line. Those\u0026nbspcomments have proved prescient.\u0026nbspOutside of\u0026nbspthe PPI nasty, CYBG has a decent enough story to tell. Merging with Virgin Money should give it a shot in the arm.

The Cupertino-based firm, which reached a trillion dollar valuation earlier this year, has plunged into a bear market due to fears over iPhone production. A bear market is generally held to be one in which a stock’s value declines by 20 per cent or more from a 52-week high, or over a period of two months. Apple becomes first public company to be worth $1 trillionApple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingWhy Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple reports profits rise but iPhone sales stallThe share price fell 4 per cent on Monday after reports that Apple had cut production orders for its three newest iPhones, and the stock was down 4.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. Apple’s decline brought the other so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) down too - altogether, these companies have lost more than $1 trillion (£780bn) in market cap from the point of their highest valuation in the last year. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said the sliding share prices showed how the FAANG firms can be victims of their own successes. “As much as the companies could do no wrong when investors were positively inclined towards them, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Microsoft are now selling off much quicker than other stocks,” she said. “Part of the problem is that investors no longer expect an average growth in profit if the sales are not double digit and spectacular – as is the case in with the latest iPhone - the disappointment quickly translates into a selloff in shares. “Given how high these stocks have risen over the last year the selloff then triggers chart signals which only provoke more and faster selling.”Tech firms in Europe have felt the pain of their US counterparts, with the European Stoxx 600 tech index dropping on Tuesday to hit its lowest level since February 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks. Mars bars could run out in ‘weeks’ in the event of a no-deal BrexitNHS faces £2.3bn cost of no-deal Brexit, report warnsIgnore the hot air from cabinet members about a no-deal BrexitThe Bank’s Financial Stability Report will be published alongside the results of the stress tests on Wednesday, 28 December. They were previously scheduled to be released on 5 December. The timing has been changed to allow politicians to look over the Bank’s assessment before any parliamentary votes on Brexit. The Treasury Select Committee has previously asked the Bank to look at the scenario of transition to World Trade Organisation trading terms for the UK , which would be the default in the event of no deal.The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, told the TSC on Tuesday: “The question has to be: in 20 months would we be ready to have in place all the customs arrangements…that are necessary for a WTO trading relationship with the European Union? A transition to WTO could look like no-deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of no-deal was high, and when asked whether the chance of a no-deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From my appearance, my body size and shape to my performance and even dragging innocent people into this like they did to Nile Rodgers simply for a clickbait headline is totally uncalled for.

She ended her post thanking her fans for “being strong minded enough to not be influenced by the negativity”, and added a note at the end of her message saying: “PS... I did watch my performance back and I LOVED IT!”Following Sunday night’s show, Chic star Nile Rodgers took to social media to dismiss suggestions he had “snubbed”\u0026nbspCheryl\u0026nbspby not standing after her performance.Rodgers, 66, who has been filling in for X Factor judge Robbie Williams, tweeted two photographs from the show and a long explanation saying: “So I get to the lounge, open my powerbook and it says: X Factor fans are ‘convinced’\u0026nbspthat I snubbed\u0026nbspCheryl.“With this pic on left as proof. Pic on right was me before I just happened to sit down. I’d never snub ANYBODY. It’s not my nature. Really folks? This is what we’ve come to.”Cheryl, who rose to fame as part of girl group Girls Aloud after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, and ex-partner Liam Payne, 25, became first-time parents in March last year to a baby boy they named Bear.She last appeared as a judge on ITV’s The X Factor in 2015 and featured in 2017 alongside head judge Simon Cowell during the judges’ houses stage.Cheryl‘s next television project sees her take the role of dance captain on BBC One’s new Saturday night show, The Greatest Dancer, due to air next year.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time.

We will also listen.“Recently, bodies from across the sector, including the Association of Colleges, have raised concerns about students in both the 16-18 and 19-25 age ranges who are being forced to re-sit English and Maths GCSEs over and over again due to ESFA funding requirements.“So I can announce today that we have listened and we have heard. \u0026nbspA Labour government would end that requirement.” \u0026nbspJulian Gravatt, deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges (AoC), welcomed Labour’s position on English and maths GCSE retakes.He said: “It’s vital that every young person leaves education with strong foundations in these subjects– they are the basis for success in work and in life.“Colleges have long called for flexibility in how to support learners to achieve this. A one-size fits all approach has not worked and does not work.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceshipupper stage \u0026amp Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons), a follow-up read.The spaceship – whatever its name – is SpaceX\u0027s big hope for the future of space travel. The company hopes that it will eventually replace not only the existing modes of deep space transport but its existing rockets and spacecraft, too.Eventually, SpaceX\u0026nbsphopes to use the Starship to carry people to Mars, where they will live, and possibly even beyond. In the shorter term, the company is aiming for a 2023 mission that will see a Japanese billionaire pay for a host of space tourists to take a trip around the Moon – if the Starship, which will cost around $5 billion to build – is ready in time.Starship is actually the spacecraft\u0027s fourth name. Before it was known as the BFR, the spaceship was known as the\u0026nbspInterplanetary Transport System or ITS – and before that it was called the Mars Colonial Transporter, or MCT, marking it out as part of Mr Musk\u0027s plan to send people to take over Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

Those are intended to make it easier to cut down on how much time you spend there.That includes a feature where users can set a daily reminder when they\u0027ve gone over the amount of time they want to spend on Facebook. That reminder can be for whatever amount of time, and can be easily dismissed when it arrives – but is intended as a quick way of nudging yourself to get off the app.But it also allows people to easily unfollow pages and unfriend people so that their news feed is a more healthy place to be. Clicking that option will show a host of pages that you might want to hide from your timeline, for instance.The new tool works much like the Your Activity page that was recently\u0026nbsplaunched on Instagram. A range of different companies – including both Google in Android and Apple for iOS\u0026nbsp– have launched similar tools, graphing usage in an attempt to ensure that people are using the services safely.It comes amid increasing concern about the damage social networks and other technology are doing to the people who use them.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity. The atmosphere aboard is aboard is described as having a “metallic-ionisation-type smell”.Aki Hoshide participates in extravehicular activity outside the International Space Station (NasaGetty)10. So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling. Even urine is reused.Created with Sketch.A visitor’s guide to the International Space Station Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The training\u0027s over, Tim… next stop: the greatest lab in the universe!

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present. The device is a hybrid recycler and 3D printer that melts plastics down so that new tools can be created.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But 4K is already old news, after Samsung revealed its first 8K TV meant for consumers – doubling the name, quadrupling the number of pixels on offer and heralding the future of screens.Samsung\u0027s newest television crams a full 33 million pixels into a vast display that it hopes becomes the ultimate way of watching the TV. Despite how it might sound, 8K is actually four times as many pixels as existing TVs, and offers what the company says is a significant improvement and innovation on that technology.But the 8K TV isn\u0027t only the consequence of wanting to cram in more pixels or to add bigger numbers to specifications. That sort of thing is largely pointless anyway, because at a certain point those numbers fail to matter: once you have enough pixels in a small enough screen, the eye can\u0027t actually see anymore and so the extra ones aren\u0027t visible anyway.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

As the screens expand, so must the number of pixels, if companies want to keep a consistently good look – and so the 8K TV starts at 65, going all the way up to 85. (That vast screen, big enough to fill the wall of a small living room, will set you back £15,000.)And so expanding TVs has left companies like Samsung racing not only against the latest spec numbers and pixel counts, but to ensure that their displays are high quality enough to cater for the vast sizes that people are buying them in.We\u0027re seeing a trend towards larger screen technologies, says Stuart Mayo, Samsung\u0027s director of TV and AV, speaking at the launch of the new displays. People have moved from 32 inches to 55 inches as the average screen size now.Part of the reason that people are embracing bigger TVs is that while the screen has grown, the rest has gradually fallen away – the big bezels and backs that often came attached to the display itself have disappeared. That means that people can fit much more screen in the same amount of space, and that the TVs themselves aren\u0027t quite so ugly, meaning that the average display size has quickly shot up.And so you are convinced, encouraged to drop £15,000 on a television roughly the size of a single bed. But then you start to worry that all of those huge numbers might mean nothing if you only end up watching broadcasts of the same 4K – or, most likely, 1080p at best – content that you have been viewing all along.There\u0027s no reason to be concerned, says Samsung: the TV is smart and beautiful enough to analyse that video and make sure it looks its glorious best on your vast new television. The arrayed computing power in the 8K TV allows it to upscale whatever content it is given and fill in the quality gaps to make it look right at home on the vast new displays.Yes, we have 8K coming out before we have a huge volume of 8K content, says Mayo. But you\u0027ll be able to enjoy everything at the world\u0027s best quality.It upscales any of the content you love watching today. So Netflix box sets, the rugby world cup, the olympics – our TV allows you to upscale any of that content and it will be superior.Hidden behind all TVs is what is perhaps the really important part: a processor that is the engine room of the TV and delivers the picture experience that appears on the display itself. Making the 8K TV has largely been made possible by advances in that kind of technology that allows the whole set to be doing far more work, and more smartly: inside of the television is artificial intelligence that can analyse the huge images, take them apart, and then use its technology to work out how best to show them.However beautiful and lush the TVs look when they\u0027re doing their thing, there is one ugly fact that remains true no matter how smart they are: that they are an unfortunate obelisk of black when they\u0027re turned off. That gets even more of a problem as the TVs get bigger and take up more space, swallowing up rooms with their big black void.Samsung thinks it has a fix for that, too, with its ambient mode. As well as allowing the television to be helpful even when you\u0027re not watching anything – by showing news headlines or other updates, for instance – it has something that Mayo refers to as its chameleon feature. Users take a picture of the wall behind the TV and the display then replicates that, allowing the television to effectively disappear. As TVs get bigger and more beautiful, Samsung is also working to make sure they can be a little more invisible, too.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As they do, a fast wind is thrown off, moving as fast as\u0026nbsp12 million kilometres an hour.Eventually the system is going to throw out a\u0026nbsplong-duration gamma-ray burst, according to the astronomers who found it. They can last just a couple of seconds but throw out as much energy as the sun will emit in its whole lifetime.The two stars appear to be rotating so fast that they are close to ripping each other apart. It\u0027s that fast rotation that scientists expect will mean that Apep is likely to throw out one of the GRBs\u0026nbspwhen its core collapses at the end of its life.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

of asylum seekers as report shows almost half of asylum properties \u0027not fit for purpose\u0027\u0026nbspor in need of \u0027urgent\u0027\u0026nbspactionClick to followThe IndependentInspectors found examples of accommodation that was dirty and had visible defects including leaks, damp and broken equipmentThe Home Office has been accused of “underplaying” poor treatment of asylum seekers in a government report which finds people seeking sanctuary in Britain are residing in dirty, unsuitable accommodation that fails to their meet basic needs.Research\u0026nbspby the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) states that ministers\u0026nbsphave been “too accepting” of the limitations of the current system and were\u0026nbspfailing to cooperate with private providers to improve current conditions.Since 2012, the Home Office has outsourced the provision of asylum accommodation to private providers Serco, Clearsprings and G4S, and despite widespread criticism of the conditions in the housing, the original five-year contracts were extended in 2017 for another two years.Asylum seekers forced to make 40-mile journeys to Home Office meetingsAsylum seeker facing removal despite daughter being at risk of FGMAsylum seekers ‘could contribute £42m to UK if allowed to work’The new findings show that less than a quarter of asylum properties met contractual standards, while almost half were deemed “not fit for purpose” or in need of “urgent” action.Inspectors found examples of accommodation that was\u0026nbspdirty and had visible defects including leaks, damp, and broken equipment, as well as\u0026nbspfailing to meet the basic needs of\u0026nbspvulnerable\u0026nbspgroups such as\u0026nbspsurvivors of torture, pregnant women and LGBT+ asylum seekers.In one property, a converted basement flat used to house a married couple and their three-year old child, inspectors found numerous problems including ventilation, damp, a water leak and noise from the house above, plus a lack of outside space for the child to play.The child had health issues and inspectors were shown a letter from the NHS which stated that these were caused by the ventilation and damp conditions in the flat.Another property, used to house seven asylum-seeking mothers with children under two years old, contained broken equipment, window bars – which one resident said made them feel like that they were “in prison” – blocked drains, an infestation of rodents, damp and mould.It comes after The Independent revealed new research showing asylum-seeking families were being placed in accommodation so dirty it has made children ill and driven some women to self-harm.Of 43 stakeholders from which the new report gathered evidence, two-thirds focused on poor property standards, with frequent references to defects, damp, dirt and vermin, while almost half referred to the unsuitability of the accommodation provided for vulnerable asylum seekers.Women and child asylum seekers ‘living among vermin’Inspectors said discussions with the Home Office, the providers, NGOs and service users about particular properties revealed how difficult it was to agree on what was “an acceptable standard” of accommodation.They said the Home Office was not working hard enough to identify, record and share information on the vulnerability of LGBT+ asylum seekers,\u0026nbspin large part due to its “hit or miss” recording and sharing of sexual orientation and gender identity information\u0026nbspand “inconsistent categorisation of complaints and incidents” by the providers.The report also found that many pregnant and post-partum asylum seekers were unable to access sinks and sterilisation equipment or facilities to boil water, as well as not being provided with essential equipment such as a cot and facing delays in additional support payments.The Home Office was unable to say how many pregnant women were in asylum accommodation, which inspectors said was “essential to a proper understanding of whether the present policies and practices are meeting the needs of this particularly vulnerable group, especially in relation to the availability and continuity of medical care”.In light of the report, chief inspector David Bolt said: “For all its efforts, this inspection found the Home Office too accepting of the limitations of the current contracts and how things are, and too optimistic that the work it has in hand and the new contracts would bring about improvements.”He added: “While it has accepted all of my recommendations, the Home Office’s formal response\u0026nbsplooks to underplay the evidence of poor accommodation standards. This is unhelpful when it comes to building trust.”Asylum seekers forced to make 40-mile journeys to Home Office meetingsIn response to the report, the Home Office said it had accepted all of the recommendations and had a\u0026nbsp”comprehensive action plan” to\u0026nbspsupport customers in raising issues with their accommodation and ensure vulnerable people receive a “more tailored service”.But\u0026nbspAndy Hewett, head of advocacy at the Refugee Council, said he was “deeply concerned” and accused the Home Office of ignoring some of the report’s\u0026nbsprecommendations.“While\u0026nbspa concrete assurance plan is welcome, as is the recognition by the Home Office that some people have specific needs that should be considered by safeguarding experts, it has ignored the point made about people being routinely placed, with no choice, in the same room or same long-term accommodation as unrelated adults,” he said.Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the charity had worked with asylum seeking families “housed in cramp, dark, and damp accommodation far away from the services they need, pregnant women placed in homes without easy access to a bathroom, and parents whose children have to miss out on school because their home is too far from any school places”.He added: ”We are glad that the Home Office has accepted all of the report’s recommendations and call on them to act with urgency to ensure that people in the asylum system are housed in good quality, appropriate accommodation where they are able to access essential services.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

Bacteria found 600m underground ‘hint at alien life on Mars’Stomach bug bacteria can produce electricity, study findsWhat is E coli and what are the symptoms of infection?Healthy people may be ‘resistant’ to ‘good’ bacteria in probioticsTony Lewis, of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, who analysed the findings, suggested bacteria in such high concentrations, and the presence of coliforms, could indicate failings in cleaning standards – and may even represent a potential risk to health, particularly for people with weakened immune systems.Watchdog Live presenter Nikki Fox\u0026nbspsaid: “These results are really disappointing. I don’t think most people would expect this type of bacteria to be present in things we’re actually consuming – and certainly not in some of the biggest names in the business. What we’ve found suggests that the procedures all these chains have in place aren’t always being followed at a local level.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

The other bacteria found can come from a number of sources, including growth in storage and dispensing systems.He said: “Ice is like any other food. We consume it, we ingest it, it goes into our stomachs, into our guts, and if it’s loaded up with the wrong type of bacteria then it can make us ill. So that’s why this is a concern. “On the basis of the chains that we’ve looked at, the industry needs to do better, making sure that their cleanliness is being well managed.”The findings come almost 18 months after Watchdog Live found traces of faecal bacteria present in the ice at high street coffee shops including Starbucks, Caffé Nero and Costa.

Hungry Horse also said it had begun an internal investigation and had deep-cleaned all ice and soda equipment.Slug and Lettuce said it was re-investigating the claims made by the programme, had commissioned audits and “reiterated our processes to all sites”.JD Wetherspoon said the company would “take on board the findings of the report”.Harvester said cleanliness and hygiene was of “critical importance”\u0026nbspat their restaurants.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Three courses were charged at £39.50.After The Independent asked Tate Modern to comment, it was dropped from the menu.\u0026nbspFoie gras comes from the fatty, enlarged livers of ducks and geese that are force-fed grain and fats, twice a day or more, until they are grossly overweight.Last week footage was released from a French foie gras farm that activists said showed geese and ducks experiencing extreme suffering as they were force-fed using metal tubes.The activists\u0026nbspsaid they witnessed “terrified, panting ducks crammed into tiny, filthy cages, while\u0026nbspgeese struggled\u0026nbspto escape as a vast amount of food was pumped down their throats using a large metal tube”.Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer, not a privately owned restaurantEmma Milne, who witnessed the animals’\u0026nbsptreatment, said: “The birds’ vocalisation made absolutely clear that it was an extremely unpleasant experience. If that’s what they’re happy to show you, I dread to think what some of the worse farms are like.”Animal Equality are now\u0026nbspasking all British restaurants not to offer foie gras.“Tate Modern offers it only on its festive menu, not year round, so is reinforcing the idea that foie gras is a luxury product to treat yourself to at Christmas,”\u0026nbspToni Shephard, the group’s executive director, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Offering foie gras is completely at odds with the idea of a ‘modern’ institution. It is produced in a barbaric and outdated way, and production is banned in this country on welfare grounds.“Tate is a charity and partly funded by the taxpayer – not a privately owned restaurant that is accountable to no one but its shareholders. The Tate’s own website states it is accountable to the public via parliament for the services it provides.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

It would be a huge upset if they did not sign the agreement.The Daily Mail and the  could save us from a hard BrexitThere will not be any negotiation on the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – that, as far as the EU is concerned, is settled. Many countries have said as much publicly, in the face of cabinet Brexiteers demanding a rethink.But the second part of the deal, the future relationship, is far from sealed. If anything, EU states believe their negotiators might have given away too much to Britain: some are unhappy about concessions given with little in return, and want quid pro quos like guaranteed access to British waters for their fishing fleets.If there are changes there, things could get even trickier for the prime minister at home – but these are real countries fighting for their own interests, not fantasy negotiating partners only committed to making things easy for the prime minister.None of the details for the summit are finalised yet, with an agenda set to be released later this week. We’re not sure at this point whether actual negotiation will take place at it, or whether it will just be a glorified rubber stamp. Brussels is known to favour the latter.I was on holiday during the Brexit chaos – what did I miss?Legally, the summit has to take place, because only the European Council – that is the 27 leaders meeting together in Brussels – can sign off the deal and make the political declaration about the future relationship.Those in Brussels and other EU capitals do not like being seen to “meddle” in British politics, precisely because they know how poorly they are perceived.They mostly stayed out of the referendum, they accepted the result, and they have mostly declined to call for a rerun or anything to that effect.But it is possible some may break the habit of a lifetime at the gathering and urge British members of parliament to back the deal. If they do not do it directly, they might apply pressure through other means – perhaps by warning of the prospect of no deal if it is voted down.This will be a difficult sell, however. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said as recently as last week that Brexit could be stopped if Britain wanted. If the deal is voted down, staying in is still an option. And there is clearly not a majority for a no-deal departure in the House of Commons.But despite conspiracy theories from both some Brexiteers and the odd\u0026nbspRemainer, everyone around the summit table will want a deal – just not necessarily at any cost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Instead votes to elect South Korean candidate. Reason prevails in this dark world.”“Now, the clear next step is to suspend Russia from Interpol for its consistent and serial abuse of the Red Notice and diffusion system for political purposes. My legal team is preparing an initiative to use Interpol’s own rules to begin this process.”Mr Kim, a police official in South Korea, was serving as interim president after Mr Meng’s departure from the post and was senior vice president at Interpol.\u0026nbspBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing “red notices” that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world’s “most-wanted” list.\u0026nbspHuman rights groups raised their concerns two years ago when Interpol’s general assembly approved Mr Meng as president. Amnesty International criticised “China’s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad”.Several prominent Kremlin critics warned that electing Mr Prokopchuk— who has ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin — would have undermined the international law enforcement agency and politicised police cooperation across borders.\u0026nbspRussia accused critics of running a “campaign to discredit” Mr Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\u0026nbspSir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned the Russian’s election would be “an absolute insult to the victims of the Salisbury attack”, while Marina Litvinenko, widow of poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko, had said Mr Putin’s critics in the UK would not feel safe if he\u0026nbspwon.The White House came out on Tuesday against the election of Mr Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying “the Russian government abuses Interpol’s processes to harass its political opponents.” He said the US\u0026nbsp”strongly endorses” Mr Kim.\u0026nbspThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Washington encourages all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world’s most critical law enforcement bodies.“We believe Mr\u0026nbspKim will be just that,” he said.Russia, however, secured a win for its ally\u0026nbspSerbia\u0026nbspon Tuesday, when Kosovo’s bid to join Interpol failed to garner enough votes at the general assembly in Dubai.The move would have boosted Kosovo’s efforts at recognition of its statehood. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Small boats provide the bulk of jobs in the catching sector and contribute to the economy of coastal towns around the country.

Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter. We were snowed in for a week. Nobody could come to visit.The missus couldn’t get to the shops to buy anything.It was just about perfect. All you need is a few bottles of Jack Daniel’s and some soup. Make sure you’re prepared.LUCKY, lucky earthquake victims.Here’s Paris Hilton in Mexico, visiting survivors of the  earthquake.And giving them bottles of Paris Hilton perfume and cushions with “Paris Hilton” stamped across them.Just exactly what they needed.Paris said: “I love the people, I think they are all beautul, they have great hearts, they are beautul inside and out, they are very genuine and incredible.”Just like you, Paris, just like you. A WOMAN who met the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester says she was offered an interesting proposition.Have sex with me, the -year-old goat suggested, and I’ll make you a baroness.Can’t say fairer than that, can you The most I’ve ever offered is a bag of Pickled Onion Monster Munch.Lester has been suspended from the House of Lords as a result.Thing is, it’s always the liberals who get up to this kind of stuff.Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and now Lester.Ladies, I’m telling you,a liberal bloke approaches you in a bar telling you how pro-feminist he is, activate your alarm, call the Old Bill and get the hell out, sharpish.THIS is Sophie Michelle. She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off. Threatening to kill anyone who supports her.We should give the poor woman asylum in our country, away from the Islamist savages in Pakistan.But the Government fears “reprisal” attacks by the extremists.That’s a gutless response and devoid of ­principle.Give Asia Bibi a home here. We’ll deal with the savagesthey try ­anything on.We’re getting used to it, after all.I’M trying to work out which of the Remoaners I dislike more. Gary Lineker or Tony Blair.I suppose Gary didn’t illegally invade a sovereign country.But then Blair never sported a stupid goatee beard or spent half of his le selling crisps.Although I daresay he would have donethere’d been enough dosh in it.Lineker, like many other remoaners, was demanding a second vote on Brexit.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show.

Even at these levels, smoking is not a major risk factor for this rare disease.MPs have previously called for e-cigarettes to be free on the NHS as a stop smoking device.E-cigarettes are less harmful than conventional smoking and the two should not be treated as the same, according to a report by the Science and Technology Committee .Public Health England estimates suggest e-cigarettes are at least  per cent less harmful than smoking.Around . million Brits use e-cigarettes, and its thought , use them as an aid to stop smoking.A report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vapingtoday sugguests employers should provide designated indoor vaping areas - including in the Houses of Parliament.They want vaping to be more acceptable around the workplace with proper vaping policies for businesses and public places to be put in place in a bid to tackle misunderstandings about the practice"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450871607.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"google fuels hypochondria health conditions","story":"They say searches for serious health conditions have increased by thousands of percentage points over the last three years.UK search volumes for terms such as how to know chest pains are serious have risen by , per cent from  to , analysis of Google data has found.And searches for keywords such as sciatica, acne and IBS plus the word treatment are now searched more than , times on average every year since .Stomach ache and aching legs were also found to top online searches, with an average of , and , searches yearly since .GP near me was googled , times between January and August alone this year.Hannah Sims, product manager for Perkbox Medical, which commissioned the research, said: “The NHS has been looking after the health of the nation for  years now.“It’s a wonderful system, but it isn’t without its challenges, particularly in primary care.“Currently, over one million people a week in the UK struggle to get themselves seen by a doctor when they need it.“GP surgeries tend to only be open during the usual working hours and are stretched to fit everyone in, pushing appointment waiting times to around two weeks.“Similarly, the average health insurance premium in the UK costs £,.The NHS lists hypochondria as health anxiety.

Yes There was a mixture of outrage and jubilation on Twitter after many felt their biscuit eating beliefs had violated, while others were relieved to finally find someone who shared their technique.New techniques were offered, confusion was expressed and someone even threatened to call the biscuit police. Its safe to say its a heavily contested subject matter, especially to the biscuit fanatics.One tweeter named Margaret responded saying you might as well just chew on some hay, unless you have the chocolate on the bottom.Paul on the other hand had a more aggressive technique - to shove a whole one in my gob for maximum effect.Similarly, another tweeter suggested just having two, in a sandwich format, meaning more biscuit and less mess - so everyone wins.In response to Amna, @sjh_canada offers this bizarre explanation.Although it contradicts Amnas way of thinking, this tweeter has a well-thought-out theory behind their technique.Meanwhile this tweeter is taking things to another level threatening to call the police.Hes clearly not a fan of chocolate thumb prints all over his possessions.After all this debating, Anna seems to find an answer to her own question when she Googles the question and receives this answer.Margaret agrees with Amna as her technique provides the most most tasteMcVities have actually previously stated the chocolate actually goes on the bottom, confirming Amnas tweet.Someone wrote to the company on Facebook to ask the all-important question.Despite these answers, that wont stop social media users fighting over their biscuit opinions.And that definitely wasnt the end of this online debate as Amnas tweet was then shared on Reddit, with predictably hilarious results.Rawrbear writes: The packaging shows it chocolate side up.

I think we’re onto something here.However there is a sense of artistic licence coming into play when you eat your own biscuit.Witchfinder_Specic follows on from the point about logo branding by saying the fanciest side should be at the top.They write: On a plain digestive, the side with the name and logo pressed into is fancier than the flat side, so that is the top. But dip the flat side in chocolate and it becomes fancier than the non-chocolaty side, so the biscuit flips and the chocolate side now becomes the top.This Reddit user ends the debate with a parodied speech of physicist Brian Cox.He claims its all subjective as the universe has no up or down, among other scientic theories written in a Brian Cox voice.The Sun Online has approached McVities for comment - to end this debate once and for all."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004505886061.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nadine dorries brexit coup theresa may","story":"Brexiteers trying to oust the PM have so far been frustrated by failing to cross the crucial threshold of  letters.But today a leading rebel insisted there are  backbenchers who have demanded a leadership vote.That means only two more are needed to trigger a challenge - suggesting a vote could come later this week.Nadine Dorries was one of the first MPs to announce in public that she wants the PM to go.Today she claimed backbench boss Sir Graham Brady has almost got enough letters for a vote of no confidence.She told the BBC: I think the numbers about .

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are nor delivering on our joint priorities - which is the Union.”The demand comes as the PM heads out to Brussels this afternoon to take personal charge of negotiations ahead of Sunday’s summit of EU leaders to sign off the deal.During a  minute meeting with EU Commission boos Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May will spell out what she still wants to see in the deal’s political declaration of future hopes for a trade deal.The Cabinet yesterday backed Theresa May to “win a game of two halves” and turn around bitter Tory and DUP opposition to her orce deal by winning a promise of a good trade deal from the EU in the future.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox presented the PM’s top table with the football analogy, adding: “I am confident we can win it back in the second half”.Environment Secretary Michael Gove added: “It’s a European Cup tie - a home fixture and then an away fixture”.But the DUP also insist she must tell Mr Juncker she is to abandon the controversial Irish backstop agreed last week that places Northern Ireland under a dferent set of EU rules to the rest of the UK.The DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: “It is time for the Prime Minister to work for a better deal.“The only option is to look beyond this Withdrawal Agreement.“A stubborn determination by the PM to pursue a binary choice of this deal or no deal is not in the country’s interests.”Mrs May’s minority administration relies on the DUP’s ten MPs to give her a majority in the Commons.If they abstain on votes, it reduces her majority to just three andthey vote against the Government the Tories will be defeated.Chancellor Philip Hammond as well as Brexit rebel Boris Johnson are both expected to speak at the DUP’s annual conference this weekend to try to court the pro-British party for their opposing causes.But when asked who had the best ideas for Brexit a bleak “None” was the highest response to a list of MPs, with  per cent of people choosing that option.Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg and ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage had eight per cent and Theresa May five per cent, said OnePoll’s survey.But the DUP’s Sammy Wilson told ministers that they will not back down with more bribes, adding: “We fought through a terrorist campaign - we had , people killed in Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom.“If you think we’re going to be bought off by a few baubles in order to allow this deal to go through we won’t be”.Sources claim Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell told Cabinet Ministers last week the Government was “one nil” down given concessions in the Withdrawal Agreement.When told, Eurosceptic Iain Duncan Smith joked: “I’d say they’re three nil down, against Barcelona and they’ve had a player sent off.”Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also professed her loyalty to Mrs May yesterday during Cabinet after last week’s resignations, despite being the ringleader of the ‘Pizza Club’of plotters.Brexiteer Ms Leadsom opened her speech to the table by saying: “Prime Minister, I don’t even like pizza”.Last night the Government took the extraordinary step of accepting opposition amendments on the Finance Bill, which is the legislation that passes the Budget.Government whips feared a humiliating loss on the votes - which were Labour and SNP demands for more action on tax evasion and tax avoidance - in the wake of the DUP’s decision not to back the Government in the crucial votes.It raised even further questions about Mrs May’s ability to govern a majority in the Commons.A Labour source said: “The Government in all effect has given up on government. Governments simply do not accept amendments to the Finance Bill. They’ve been forced to accept amendments. It’s extraordinary.“Fundamentally when a government can’t pass Budgets, they’re not in power.This is a pretty signicant moment.”Former Tory leader Lord Howard last night tore apart Mrs Mays plans to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He questioned how the proposed backstop plan would mean taking back control.He said: Under Article  the United Kingdom has a unilateral, untrammelled right to leave the European Union.Under the backstop provisions of the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom can only leave with the consent of the European Union.How can that be described as taking back control Brexit Minister Lord Callanan replied: There are mechanisms to bring the backstop to an end. But he is right to say they are mechanisms that would need to be mutually agreed.I do understand the point he is making.They want the Irish “backstop”, which weakens the Britain Northern Ireland union, binned.

For more than two years the Prime Minister has warned the EU no deal is better than a bad deal - despite fears it could cause food shortages and civil unrest. Now she has turned No Deal into a threat against Labour - warningthey dont accept her version of Brexit, No Deal is inevitable. But today Amber Rudd directly contradicted that, just days after ed to Mrs Mays Cabinet as Work and Pensions Secretary. It is my view that Parliament, the House of Commons, will stop No Deal, she told the BBC. There isnt a majority in the House of Commons to allow that to take place.  The comments by Ms Rudd, a committed pro-EU Tory, are a blow to the PMs PR push with Labour as she heads towards a crucial Commons vote on her Brexit deal. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman declared triumphantly: It was a bluff, of course it was a bluff. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer added she had ignored the No spin and must now drop the  choice between a bad deal and no deal. But the remarks could also scare Tory Brexiteers into backing Mrs Mays deal - to avoid having, in the Prime Ministers words, no Brexit at all. In an explicit new threat today, Ms Rudd warned: The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit. The Sunday Mirror revealed this week that Mrs May was planning to launch this strategy in a bid to persuade Leave-backing MPs to come on side.   The deal is due to be signed off by  EU leaders in Brussels this Sunday after Mrs May meets today with EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker for afternoon tea. It will then be followed by a Commons vote before Christmas. Mrs May faces the prospect of defeat by Labour, the DUP and rebel Tories, but today Ms Rudd said I dont accept that at all. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. This is the cake its been baked the Prime Ministers going to bring it back, she said. She warned MPs anything could happenthe deal is rejected and that is not going to be good for the country. She added MPs must take a careful look over the abyss and the likelihood is, despite what people say, that the withdrawal agreement will get through. Ms Rudd added she did not believe there would be a second EU referendum - moments after a Tory colleague called for one.   Damian Collins, a Tory MP and Remain backer, said that he will not back Theresa Mays Brexit deal as it stands when it comes to the Commons vote. The Commons Culture Committee chairman said he wanted further negotiations to ensure the UK cannot be trapped under EU rules against its will. And he said thatMPs cannot agree on a withdrawal deal, an election or second referendum should be called before March  to allow voters to decide whether they want to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit. Theresa Mays Cabinet has signed off a -page draft Brexit deal with Brussels - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UKFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HERE If we couldnt get an agreement and we were stuck in a situation where it was a deal we dont want or the clf-edge... I dont think as Parliament we could just stand back and watch the country fall off the edge of a clf without asking the people whether that was the step they wanted to take, he told BBC Radio s Today programme. Confirming he will vote against Mrs Mays current offer, Mr Collins said: I dont accept that this is a deal we have to accept or face the clf-edge. We would be in this deal in a situation, I believe, worse than the one we are in now and something no-one voted for, where we would be bound to abide by all the European rules and locked into a system we cant independently leave.

But Esther McVey has not been holding back on Twitter since she was liberated to speak her mind. The MP - who was accused of misleading Parliament over the welfare shake-up Universal Credit - has retweeted messages calling herself gutsy and dignied. At least one of her tweets, however, appears to have backfired. A critic pointed out Universal Credit claimants can be sanctioned for three years for giving up their job.  Wonder whether @EstherMcVey will see her MPs salary reduced for quitting  Paul Treloar asked. She replied: Hi Paul. In answer to your question. By resigning, my salary has been halved.  This is, of course, mostly true. Ms McVey has lost her pound, top-up for being a Cabinet minister, forcing her to scrape by on a pound, MPs wage. But its fair to say it went down like a cup of the proverbial.   Many Twitter users claimed the MP was trying to relate to the plight of people forced to food banks by Universal Credit. Edward Paxton told her: So your trying to relate to people who barely get pound a year who literally have to freeze or starve let alone the rest regardless of situation, when youre on what pound get an extra house and expenses paid for and probably get paid for all sorts of other things  Twitter user Tom Lines told her: The question was whether the large salary you get as an MP would be reduced. It wasn’t. Naturally, you lost your ministerial salary when you decided to stop being a minister. But that is not the point that @PaulieTandoori was making. Another user joked: Halved to poundk as an MP mate... hardly straight to ramen noodles is it. And Liverpool Lib Dem councillor Kay Davies told her: You should quit as an MP. You have brought unprecedented levels of misery to so many people. And you continue to mock them. How much do you claim for weekly groceries off the tax payer  The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place.

But despite Tory George Osborne slashing billions from benefits she claimed: What I resent about his approach is the motives he attributes to us. The motives are wrong.  Ms Rudd admitted there had been problems with Universal Credit including soaring use of food banks adding: I’m looking at what we can do to get cash into people’s hands earlier.

Tipping the paperboy and binmen and even watching a James Bond film on December th are no longer part of the festive routine. Researchers who carried out a detailed study found time and financial pressures are to blame along with a fear of not wanting to give the impression of being old fashioned. Overall more than half the , adults who took part expressed a belief that old traditions are falling by the wayside.  The stats show just a third of Brits will hang a wreath on their door this year, and only  per cent will put up a Christmas tree. Amazingly, one in four will NOT enjoy a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings this year. In fact, only seven in  are planning a traditional giving and receiving of gts. British Corner Shop – who export products to Brits around the world – carried out the in-depth research. A spokeswoman said: “Our research found there are lots of classic traditions that appear to be falling by the wayside.  “In fact, what we consider to be ‘traditional’ Christmas customs may no longer have a place at the Christmas of the future. “However, where old traditions die off, new ones are coming up to take their place – and there are still lots of old traditions that are as popular as ever.” It also emerged one tenth of festive Brits are set to watch a James Bond film on television – often a staple part of a long Christmas afternoon slumped in front of the TV. And just one in seven plan to have a nativity scene taking pride of place in their front room. Fewer than one in  plan to do Christmas carolling this season, and only five per cent will take part in Christingle. Nearly eight in  adults think that people have fewer interactions with friends and neighbours as a result of traditional Christmas activities decline.  And the majority of Brits believe that as years go by, Christmas gets less special, with the Christmas spirit peaking at age , then petering out. Of more modern traditions that have come to prominence in recent years, a fth of Brits now take part in a ‘Secret Santa’. And three in  love wearing novelty Christmas jumpers, with a further one in five visiting German Christmas markets in the run-up to the big day. A huge  per cent of respondents believe Christmas seems to start earlier and earlier every year, with eight in  Brits wishing it would revert to its old values. The study also uncovered the key dferences in how younger and older Brits will choose to celebrate Christmas this year. While the Christmas dinner remains the focal point for the day, and the festive event Brits cannot do without regardless of age, there were some key dferences.  Brits aged  to  are more likely to prioritise putting up a Christmas tree to mark the occasion. They are also more inclined to watch a Christmas film, open an advent calendar in the run up to the big day and listen to Christmas songs, according to the OnePoll study. Brits over the age of  prefer to celebrate by eating mince pies, hanging a wreath on their door and going for a post-dinner walk to burn off some calories. British Corner Shop’s spokeswoman added: “Young or old, some things are so quintessentially Christmas we couldn’t be without them. “While the entirety of the Christmas season is made up of a patchwork of traditions, nothing is more vital to the experience than friends and family gathering around the table for the most indulgent supper of the year.” Christmas traditions on the wane - and percentage of nation who WILL adopt them this year- Send a letter to Father Christmas through the fire - %- Christingle - %- Drink eggnog - %- Put a sixpence or penny in a Christmas pudding - %- Going out to sing Christmas Carols - %- Decorate a gingerbread house - %- Donate a shoebox to charity- %- Watch a James Bond film - %- Set fire to the Christmas pudding - %- Go to the Christmas pantomime - %- Hang mistletoe - %- Give a tip to your postman or binman - %- Have a nativity scene - %- Put holly and ivy up - %- Leave a mince pie and carrots out for Santa and his reindeer - %- Have a real Christmas tree - %- Drink mulled wine - %- Watch The Queens Speech - %- Put a stocking out - %- Go for a post-Christmas dinner walk - %"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram copycat stalker accused mimicking","story":"NewsInstagram copycat stalker accused of mimicking students posts committed NO crimeDundee University student Chloe Cowan says a woman using the name Honey Basra copied dozens of her photosShareCommentsByMark McGivernJames MoncurChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video creepy-classmate-copies-students-social-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA law student who claims her Instagram posts were copied by a stranger for two years was told by police that no crime was committed, it is claimed. Dundee University student Chloe Cowan says dozens of her photos - from bikini snaps to bedroom selfies - were recreated by a fellow undergraduate down to the tiniest detail. The -year-old was so terried after discovering the alleged copycat, who used the name Honey Basra on the social media site, that the situation was reported to police. Her family hoped that police would investigate it as a stalking offence, claiming the imitation crossed a line from flattery into creepiness, the Daily Record reports.  But she was left disappointed when she made a complaint. Chloe’s family made a follow-up call which prompted an officer to be sent to speak to the student, but they claim she’s not heard anything for a week. Chloe is understood to have told police that the imitation of her le went beyond photos and that the stranger also copied her food choices.  Dundee University are probing the claims. Chloe’s sister Linzi, , told how the family were unhappy with the police reaction to the complaint. She claimed: “The police were saying to my sister it wasn’t a crime and the call handler was very patronising even though my sister said she was scared in her own home.  “Then I called back and said I wasn’t happy with that. I wanted someone to go out to my sister.”has attempted to contact Police Scotland to respond to Linzis claims. Chloe was spooked after being told her posts were being used as a template for Basra’s on Instagram.  She claims that whenever she posted something on Instagram, Basra would copy them within hours, using the same poses, clothes and wording.

Jamie Barretts we Leanne was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in October after a growth the size of a pea grew into a five-centimetre mass on her left lung. Leanne, , gave birth to their baby boy  weeks prematurely after doctors decided the growth hormones caused by her pregnancy were stopping her from responding to treatment. The couple are now raising funds for le-prolonging treatment as Jamie, , said: Im not ready to lose my we and my kids arent ready to lose their mummy.  After her diagnosis, Leanne decided to continue with the pregnancy and endured a series of agonising investigative procedures throughout, reports Derbyshire Live.Leanne had been given the option of an abortion but decided against it as she had bonded with her unborn child, Jamie said.The couple were later told they were having a baby boy after losing his unborn twin before the -week scan. But doctors were forced to deliver the baby early as Leanne needed further treatment. Their baby boy, Beau Hudson Barrett, was born via Caesarean section atThe Royal Derby Hospital on November , weighing just lb oz. The couple are also parents to daughter India-Lily.Beau remains in neo-natal intensive care but his dad Jamie says he is coping well. He said: Hes doing well, hes fighting and hes improved day by day. The team down there have been absolutely brilliant.   Jamie, from Rolleston, who is thecaptain of Gresley FC, said of his daughter: Were trying to keep her away from all this. She knows that her mummys been poorly but she thinks that its just to do with the pregnancy. Jamie and Leanne have been together for  years and Leanne enjoyed a happy, healthy and active pregnancy in  when their first child, India-Lily, was born. The couple were married in , but shortly afterwards Jamie said Leanne developed what looked like a pimple on her nose which they got checked once it continued to grow. Doctors said this was likely a symptom of an auto-immune disease called Sarcoidosis and sent her for aseries of CT scans and X-rays. Further scans on her chest showed that Leanne had a mass of enlarged lymphnodes in her chest, which later tests showed were benign. But in July , Leanne began to complain of having chest pains and trouble breathing, which is when doctors found the five-centimetre mass on her lung. After visiting a specialist lung doctor at the Nuffield Health Centre in Derby, Leanne was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Doctors had already offered aiety of biopsy options to try to get to the bottom of what caused the growth, but some of these could have threatened her pregnancy and she was determined to give her baby the best possible chance. She even underwent painful investigative procedures, including chest drains and blood thinning injections, with minimal pain relief to minimise the effect on her unborn baby.  But since the birth of her son, Leannes cancer has progressed and spread rapidly to her liver, bones and brain. Jamie said Leanne had always beenvery active, enjoying running, swimming and gym classes, and had never smoked. He said: Id just say to everyone go and get checked out and be persistent, always get asecond opinion. I know not everyone has the option of private healthcare but I dread to think where we would be now without having had that second opinion. You always think its never going to happen to you, but no-one should be naive enough to think that. Jamie said he had been told that Leannes is the first case in the region where the cancer is known to have spread so quickly.He decided to start a JustGiving page not just to raise money for her treatment, but to raise awareness of her case and hopefully find someone who might be able to help.He said: It was something that I considered long and hard. We both had hard-working jobs and we lived a comfortable le, but now were not working and we need that extra treatment and to spread awareness of her story. Hopefully there is someone  out there who might be able to help us. Jamie, who is the captain and holder of the record number of appearances for Gresley FC, said he has a number of contacts in the football community and was hoping to get the page shared by some high profile names. But even he did not expect the overwhelming response that they got.   In less than  hours, they had smashed through their initial pound, target and by Tuesday they were heading rapidly towards a revised target of pound,, with more than,people having contributed. We cant thank people enough, he said. People have been incredible. Theres a lot of people supporting us and everyones been so generous. The money is set to go towards funding direct specialist treatment and other alternative homeopathic treatments to prolong Leannes le. Jamie said: Weve started some new treatment now which will keep her comfortable. Yes we want to prolong her le but ultimately we want to defy the odds, were praying for her every day and were remaining positive that she can and will beat this. Leanne has been simply overwhelmed by the well wishes, messages of support, flowers and gts that shes received.

Sue and Noel Radford welcomed baby Bonnie earlier this month, adding to their huge brood in Morecambe, Lancashire.

Now, the -year-old mum has opened up about how she manages the day-to-day chores when it comes to caring for such a large family. The family go through a staggering nine washing loads every day, and  bottles of washing up liquid a month. They also use four toilet rolls every day, reports The Sun.  Feeding the family on around pound a week, Sue revealed how they usually eat large pasta or stew dishes - using meat from their local butcher and beg from the greengrocer.Sue said: For us the kitchen is the heart of our home and the kids just love to be involved with the cooking side of it. If we had to cook three or four dferent meals, it would be absolute chaos. Speaking about the endless washing the parents are faced with, Sue said putting it away was the worst part of her laundry routine. She said: Definitely when you have a lot of children you have a lot of washing and putting it all way - I do not like putting it all away. While the parents might struggle to get a minute to themselves sometimes, Sue said always having children around is actually the best part of having such a large family. Sue added: The best thing about having a big family is you are never lonely and the kids are never lonely.   When it comes to ferrying their children around, Noel drives a minibus - which allows him to use bus lanes because it carries more than nine passengers. Six of the children are at the same primary school around  minutes away from the family home, and five attend the same secondary school.

The furious mother, who only wants to be named as Marta, become embroiled in a massive row with the parent who had ordered the seven-year-old girl to move. Marta, , told the woman not all disabilities are visible as they waited for Father Christmas to arrive at Princes Quay shopping centre in Hull, East Yorks., on the weekend.A dad had to calm the warring women, Hull Daily Mail says.Marta said: My daughter has autism and I put myself in the disabled area. I just found the area by coincidence. I was looking for a place and then saw the area and I thought why not   My daughter is OK with crowded places most of the time, but she rocks a lot to the sides and sometimes disturbs people by doing that, so I just thought lets go in there. When the woman saw me going in the area she said you cant be there, thats for disabled people. So I said not all disabilities are visible and she said Its not for prams. She thought I was there because I had a pram with me. I said Look, my eldest one has autism, then she said get out of my face. I said excuse me, how can you be so disrespectful  So she went shut up, be quiet, and it went on and on an on.  I told her things like you cant judge people so easily, you are disrespectful, its ridiculous all this. She was just telling me to shut up then saying to her kids this woman is being silly. It just made me mad she was telling me to shut up. At least once seeing her mistake she could have apologised. The argument upset other children around the mums. Marta, of Hull, added: I got loud, which I regret, then a dad of another disabled child in there told meI wanted to stand there I needed to be quiet because I was disturbing his daughter. I apologised to him and shut up. I was then in tears, due to frustration, shame and I was upset with myself for disturbing that other family, humillated. Honestly I felt judged and insulted. It was horrible.  I obviously didnt want to disturb them and this is what I regret from the whole story. If another family with a wheelchair had arrived I would probably have let them the place. I do not want to bother anyone or get advantage of anything but the place was there and she has the same right as any other disable person. She had more space for her to rock and regulate herself in there, thats why I went in there. But Marta praised staff at the shopping centre. The mother continued: A security lady was very helpful, offering me to move to another area or to have a tea as she saw how broken I was.

The -month-old’s family are clinging on to the hope he will be able to have the heart transplant he needs to save his le. His parents are now calling on peers to support Max’s Law – which would change the rules on organ donation – when it is debated on Friday during its second reading in the House of Lords. Oscar’s mum Abbie Burkmar said: “I just want him to have a normal le, go to school, go on holiday, to have a le like any other child. “He hasn’t really known that and has been in and out of hospital for most of his le. He doesn’t know what normal is.” Oscar, who has a dangerously enlarged heart, almost died recently when the powerful drugs keeping the organ beating nearly failed. His dose was increased but his family know this cannot go on for ever.   Abbie said: “It’s been horrendous. Oscar went floppy and he had no energy. “We have to live day by day. Last week I felt so sick, I didn’t think he was going to make it. He was just so weak.” The nightmare started when Oscar was diagnosed aged four months with dilated cardiomyopathy – meaning parts of the heart are enlarged and the organ cannot pump blood properly. It is the same condition that struck -year-old Max Johnson who has fronted the Daily Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign. We are pushing for organ donation in England to be changed from an opt in system to opt out – meaning it would be presumed people want to be a donor unless they specically say otherwise. It will be known as Max’s Law. He finally had a heart transplant last year, and Oscar is now waiting for the same leline before it is too late. Oscar’s condition was managed until September when he was taken to hospital near home in Bournemouth, Dorset, with suspected bronchitis.   His parents were then given the devastating news he was having heart failure and may only have days to live. Since then the family have been staying with Oscar at the specialist Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. He is clinging on to le thanks to a drug called milrinone which allows blood to flow more easily through veins – reducing pressure on the heart. Abbie said: “A few weeks ago he really deteriorated. We thought he was going to die. Now he is up and laughing at me.” She added: “He has been urgently listed for a transplant.” Abbie had to quit her part-time job and stopped her degree at Bournemouth University so she can be at his bedside. As often as possible, they are joined by the lad’s dad Josh Dunkley, a factory machine operator, and Oscar’s four-year-old brother Jack. They were all there in October when Oscar came back from the brink.   Last year  patients died while on the transplant waiting list. This included  children – seven needed a heart. There are currently , people on the active transplant waiting list including  youngsters. Abbie said: “People aren’t thinking about organ donation until it is too late. When someone dies you can save up to nine lives. A lot of organs are being wasted. It means we are wasting lives. “A lot of people agree with organ donation but they aren’t taking the time to sign up. I think this [law] change will make a dference.” Writing for the Mirror today Dan Jarvis MP, who has helped spearhead the campaign, said: “The story of baby Oscar is another reminder of why England so urgently needs to change our organ donation system.” MPs last month gave the green light to Max’s Law following our three-year campaign. It must now be approved in the Lords.   The bill will be introduced in the Lords by Labour peer and former health minister Philip Hunt. He told the Mirror: “Up and down the country there are people waiting desperately to have an organ transplant and that’s why we need to do everything we can to increase the number of donations. “It’s a very precious gt and I have been amazed by the generosity of the families of loved ones who have supported donations.” He added: “We need to do everything we can to get more donations so we can save more lives.” Children needing an urgent heart transplant have to wait two-and-a-half times as long as adults because bereaved parents of youngsters are less likely to agree to the organs being donated.The Scottish government is also considering a bill that would presume people’s consent on being potential donors. In Wales an opt out system for organ donation was introduced in December . Angie Scales, who is lead nurse for organ donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “Our thoughts are with Oscar and his family and we hope that he gets the heart transplant he desperately needs. “Hearts need to be matched by size for a successful transplant. For many young children, their only hope is to receive a heart from another young child.   “Losing a child is a terrible tragedy but we know that many parents take comfort in being able to save lives through organ donation. “There are many children alive today thanks to parents making the decision to donate when saying goodbye to their own child. But sadly hundreds of adults and children die every year due to the shortage of donated organs. “We urge people to tell their loved ones they want to become a donor and to join the NHS Organ Donor Register.” Dr Matthew Fenton, consultant paediatric cardiologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: “This has been an incredibly dficult time for Oscar and his family. “At GOSH we’ve seen first-hand the impact that the gt of organ donation can have on a young le... “Anyone can consider this amazing gt that will save lives, and we hope everyone reading Oscar’s story will be encouraged to share their organ donation wishes with their families.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poo found ice soft drinks","story":"NewsPoo found in ice and soft drinks served by these favourite pub chainsFaecal bacteria was found at Harvester, Hungry Horse, JD Wetherspoon, Slug and Lettuce, and Marston’s Two For OneShareByNada Farhoud:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsBacteria were found at Harvester, Hungry Horse, JD Wetherspoon, Slug and Lettuce, and Marston’s Two For One last month \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIce and soft drinks served at pub chains was contaminated with faecal bacteria, an investigation found.

Butyou thought your family indulged in some strange traditions over the festive season, spare a thought for the royal family. It will be Meghan Markles second Christmas as a royal so theyll be no surprises this year. From handing out coal to poor people, to eating penny-sized sandwiches and handing out silly gag gts, here’s what the Royal family will be up to this Christmas... Presents from the Queen If you thought you organised Christmas well this year, you’ve got nothing on Her Maj, who asks her more than  members of staff what they want present they want her to buy them as early as March. The Queen gives a gt to everyone in the Royal household, as long as they have worked for her for more than a year. But they must choose what they get, to a value of   pound for the most junior staff, increasing year by year to a maximum of pound. Then, a week before Christmas, staff gather in the State Apartments, and one by one come forward to receive their gt from the Queen. They thank her, saying it’s exactly what the wanted without even opening it - of course, because they chose it themselves. The Queen buys her presents from just one shop, Harrods, and has been known to shut the entire department store for hours so she can wander round. These days, however, she does most of her shopping on the internet. By tradition, the Queen also gives one hundredweight of coal to “deserving and needy” people in Windsor before Christmas, although because of central heating the numbers have dipped from around  in the early days of her reign to less than  today.  Christmas cards in the Summer   The Queen writes her Christmas cards earlier than the rest of us too - normally during her stay in Balmoral during the summer. She and Prince Phillip send  Christmas cards to heads of state, leading politicians, Commonwealth leaders, friends and family. Phillip also sends another  of his own to the military, naval and civilian organisations with which he is associated. And recipients can tell how dear they are to her by the way she signs them. Close family members have theirs signed Lillibet - the Queen’s childhood nickname. Long-time friends such as Countess Mountbatten get theirs signed Elizabeth, without the R, while others like the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and the Speak of the House of Commons get a formal Elizabeth R. Those right down the bottom of her Christmas list don’t get a personally-signed card at all, just one rubber-stamped with the Queen’s signature.  Arriving at Sandringham  A week or so before Christmas, those family members who have been invited to spend the holiday with the Queen and Prince Philip are told by the Crown Equerry in what order they are to arrive at Sandringham House and at exactly what time. Royal protocol being what it is, it’s all worked out according to precedence and seniority, with the most junior and least important arriving first. Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Prince Harry are always the last to turn up. They then form a “welcoming” committee for the Queen and Prince Philip. Despite having her own Royal Train, the Queen usually makes the journey to Sandringham via public transport, and startling oblivious passengers on the Thamelink train to King’s Lynn has become a Christmas tradition in itself.  Princes’ football matchIn recent years, it has become tradition for Princes William and Harry to play a Christmas Eve football match alongside workers from the Sandringham Estate, with the Princes always on opposing sides. The brothers usually wear the socks of their favorite teams - Aston Villa for William and Arsenal for Harry, and they take it pretty seriously, with William even sustaining an ankle injury one year, and William once demanding that the ref give his brother a yellow card.  The Princes broke with tradition only once in  when they played on the same side, for the local Black Horse Inn pub, winning -.  Unwrapping gag gts The Royal family sit down at exactly pm on Christmas Eve open their presents in the red drawing room at Sandringham. During the afternoon family members creep down to secretly place their gts in the room, where trestle tables are laid out and sections marked off with table to show where each family member’s presents should be. The rule is that no-one should open their present until given permission by Philip, who supervises the proceedings, and that every present should be a cheap “joke gt”, and the cheaper the better.   Among memorable Christmas presents down the years are a ‘Ain’t le a bitch’ bath hat given to the Queen by Harry, a grow-your-own-girlfriend kit given to Harry by Kate, and a white leather toilet seat given by Princess Anne to Prince Charles, although he actually liked it so much he now takes it with him on overseas tours. Princess Diana once fell foul of the family cheap and cheerful motto when on her first Christmas at Sandringham as a newly-wed in  she gave a cashmere sweater to Princess Anne who, in , handed over a loo-roll holder. The next year she cracked it giving Fergie a leopard-print bath mat.  Jam-penny sandwichesWhile the Royal Family enjoy much of the same traditional food as the rest of us, some customs are still exclusively royal. Like “jam penny”, sandwiches cut into circles the size of an old English penny, which are served when the family gathers for afternoon tea in the white drawing room on Christmas Eve. They also enjoy scones cut into the size and shape of a -pence piece. Later on, the family meet up again for a black tie dinner and drinks, where each royal has their own traditional tipple. The Queen favours a cocktail call the Zaza, made from Dubonnet and gin, Prince Charles prefers cherry brandy, while William and Harry both enjoy a pint of Sandringham cider, made from apple trees planted by the Queen’s father King George VI. During the dinner the Queen is known to read out corny jokes from the Christmas crackers. Later the family play charades until midnight, with nobody permitted to go to bed until Her Majesty retires.  Two church servicesOn Christmas Day the family go to church twice. First, the family attends a private service at am, when the Queen receives Holy Communion from her chaplain. Then she leads the Royal family to St Mary Magdalene Church for the traditional Christmas Day service at am. All the family walk to church except the Queen, who is driven. When the collection plate is passed round, Her Majesty’s equerry, who sits in the pew immediately behind her, hands her a pound note - the only time in the year the Queen uses money.  Whiskey with the chef  Just like most of the rest of the country, the Royal family will stuff themselves full with a traditional Christmas dinner. Theirs starts at .pm with a starter of salad with shrimp or lobster, followed by roasted turkey with traditional sides like parsnips, Brussels sprouts and carrots, then Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. Menus are all in French and the family eat from blue and white Copeland dinner service and drink from crystal stemware engraved with EIIR. As is tradition, just before the family tuck in, the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the rib roast of turkey, after which the Queen presents him with a glass of whiskey and they toast - the only time in the year that the chef joins the royals in the dining room.  After lunch the family will watch the Queen’s annual address to the nation, before adjourning to the Saloon, where the Queen’s favourite jigsaw puzzles are laid out.

Watts was sentenced to le in prison without the possibility of parole for murdering pregnant we Shanann, , along with their daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three.But Watts former neighbour, Cheryl Hallowell, , who lives two doors down from the murder house, says she wishes hed got the death penalty.  Speaking to Radar Online, she said: My husband, he called me and told me that he got a le sentence and said ‘thought you should know so you could be relieved. “I was already crying because I so was happy.” Ms Hallowell believes Watts should have been sentenced to death for annihilating his family. She said: “I just wish we had the death penalty. I hope somebody kills him in prison. It’s just wasted space. This guy killed kids, he was just really bad. Nobody understands why he had to kill them.  “I’m relieved to know that he will never be out again. We are happy that our neighborhood is safer. “He won’t be coming to this neighborhood in my letime.” During his sentencing hearing at Weld County District Court in Denver, Colorado, brutal new details of the murders came to light.The harrowing account of events told to the court detailed how Bella, , fought for le and bit her tongue as dad suffocated her. Her body was then scraped as he pushed her through a small hatch in the oil tank where he hid her and her sister Celestes bodies. Their pregnant mother Shanann was buried in a shallow grave nearby. While looking for the missing mum and daughters, investigators found a tuft of soft blonde hair on one of the tanks. Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke told the court that Watts strangled Shanann first in the early hours of August . It would have taken two minutes to kill her.  The autopsy report said Shanann had bruises in the shape of fingers on her neck. He then smothered his daughters. Bella, , fought against her father and bit her tongue as he smothered her. She was found to have several cuts in her mouth and had bitten her tongue. Mr Rourke told the court: Imagine the horror in Bellas mind as her father took her last breaths away, Bella fought back for her le.  Watts then put their bodies in his truck and drove to the site of his former employer, Anadarko Petroleum. Shanann was buried in a shallow grave and he shoved the girls bodies through the small hatches on top of oil storage tanks. However, Watts has never revealed his motive behind the murders. Rourke surmised that Watts killed his family because he wanted to stated a new le with Nichol Kessinger, who he had started dating a few months earlier. In an interview with the Denver Post, Ms Kessinger said Watts told her he had finalised a orce with his we.  “None of this answers the questions of why,” Rourke said. “If he was this happy and wanted a new start, get a orce. You don’t annihilate your family and throw them away like garbage.” The court heard that the afternoon before the murders, Watts rearranged his work schedules so he would be the only person at the site where he hid the bodies. He then called the girls school and said he was unenrolling them before discussing putting the family home up for sale with an estate agent.  Watts has never given an explanation for what he did or an account of what happened. Rourke says Watts has never shown remorse for anyone but himself. I dont think hell ever tell us, he said.

Jesus Zambada claimed to have paid off an underling of Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in . He also said he paid millions of dollars in bribes to former Mexican government official Genaro Garcia Luna on behalf of his brother, drug lord Ismael El Mayo Zambada, who remains at large. Lopez Obrador has yet to comment on the accusations. Garcia Luna said the accusations were defamation and perjury and made without any proof.   Garcia Luna said he had received commendations from high-level U.S. officials for his labors in fighting organised crime in Mexico and that he had been systematically defamed due to the actions he took against criminal networks. There has never been a single proof or evidence of all those infamies, he said. Zambada gave his testimony about the bribes on the fth day of trial under cross-examination by one of Guzmans lawyers, William Purpura.  Guzmans lawyers have said they will try to prove that Guzman is being scapegoated and that Ismael Zambada was the real head of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzman, , is charged with  criminal counts and faces le in prisonhe is convicted. He was extradited to the United States in January , after twice escaping Mexican prisons. Zambada, who was called to testy against Guzman under an agreement with U.S. prosecutors, previously told jurors that his brother and Guzman worked together for years to move multi-ton shipments of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the United States, while arranging for their rivals to be murdered.   During Purpuras cross-examination, Zambada said he paid a few million dollars to a Mexico City government official while Lopez Obrador was head of government there. He said the bribe was paid because it was believed at the time that the official could become Mexicos next secretary of public security.

Josephine Repique, , said the pregnant goat went into labour earlier this month on November  at the small farm in Sultan Kudarat, the Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn’t right.  There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby looked like a pig, with a mix of human. The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: We were shocked. We cant explain how it looks like that. “All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look. Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed mutant devil that brought bad luck.  Josephine added: Nobody knows what it is, but its not a goat. Its scary. Were all wondering why it happened andit is bad luck. Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb. He added: It is a possible case of genetic mutation. It is also possible that the mother contracted a disease called Rt Valley fever from mosquito bites and this caused the impaired development of the infant.

If the Aberdeen man hadn#t got there, Dor Peretz would have been left with a tap in.Midway through the half Scotland tested Ariel Harush in the Israeli goal. Granite City-raised Stuart Armstrong charged down the left, he played it on to former Don Ryan Fraser, his cutback found Steven Fletcher who couldn#t get a shot away.The loose ball broke for Callum McGregor  yards out and his fizzing volley was touched behind by Harush for a fruitless corner.On the half hour Forrest made a promising jink into the box on the right, but the shot was tame and blocked.Soon after Zahavi flashed in a cross from the right which strike partner Munas Dabbur was inches away from heading home after ghosting away from David Bates.But, on  minutes, Scotland hauled themselves back into the contest with an equaliser.Armstrong#s left-foot drive from the edge of the area was blocked by Sheran Yeini, the loose ball fell for Forrest, who took a touch to control before rling into the bottom right corner.Just two minutes from the interval Scotland took the lead and what a goal it was.Andy Robertson#s chip found Fletcher, the striker#s deft head flick set Ryan Christie away down the left and, with the Israeli defence caught out, he squared for Celtic team-mate Forrest to slot home from  yards.The second period started with both sides on the front foot and, on  minutes, Fletcher headed a Fraser corner just over the crossbar and soon after Callum McGregor fired a long range shot high and wide.The match and top position in the Nations League C Group One looked to be secured on  minutes.Intricate play down the left ended up with Fraser finding space on the left side of the area, the Bournemouth player#s low centre picked out Forrest, who beat a defender and calmly finished from eight yards.A great way to get his hat-trick and a fth goal in two games for the national team.After the third goal the Scots looked like they could add more with Fletcher mistiming a header at the back post from an Armstrong cross.On  minutes sub Dia Seba sent a shot just wide from the right side of the area, but  seconds later Israel had a goal back.Zahavi was given too much time and space on the edge of the area and he planted a right foot shot into the bottom right corner.Immediately after that goal Aberdeen skipper Graeme Shinnie was sent on along with Matt Phillips as Scotland attempted to see the game out.They were indebted to goalie Allan McGreor as he pulled off a magnicent point-blank save with two minutes to play to keep out sub Tomer Hemed#s volley and after that the Scots saw it out.Scotland: Allan McGregor, Callum Paterson, David Bates, Scott McKenna, Andy Robertson, Stuart Armstrong , Callum McGregor, James Forrest, Ryan Christie , Ryan Fraser, Steven Fletcher .Subs not used: Scott Bain, Jamie MacDonald, John Fleck, Jack Hendry, Gary Mackay-Steven, Oli McBurnie, Johnny Russell.Israel: Ariel Harush, Eli Dasa, Bibras Natcho, Eran Zahavi, Munsa Dabbur, Dor Peretz , Sheran Yeini, Taleb Twatha , Loai Taha , Omri, Ben Harush, Beram Kayal.Subs not used: Guy Haimov, Daniel Amos, Dan Glazer, Ayad Habashi, Shir Tzedek, Ben Sahar, Dor Micha, Manor Solomon, Ben Bitton."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/11/5beaac881c8fd.jpg ","title":"mckenna hails brave scotland team mates","story":"Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna today praised Scotland’s battling character after securing a Euro  play-off spot.Centre-back McKenna earned his eighth cap as the Scots overcame Israel -

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match. The Argyll Derby kicks off at pm and will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G, weather permitting."},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning the brambelles 2","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowFollowing the recent outstanding MOJO festival of original music in Ardfern, the Argyllshire Advertiser takes a look at what the leading musical lights of Argyll are up to following their rockin# display at MOJO.The Brambelles, Kirsteen Black from Colintraive and Alana Mathers from Glendaruel, had already been involved in singing together in their local choir, so were well acquainted with each other before deciding to start their band in .Initially covering classics, they used their skill for singing harmonies, gained at the choir, and Alana#s acoustic guitar playing, and almost immediately started playing at big festivals such as Fyne Fest, Mama Fest and Best of the West, along with many other local events and fundraising gigs where they have always been well received.Following in the footsteps of country duos The Shires and Maddie and Tae, from  they  started creating their own material, leading to their first original act at MOJO in October and created their debut EP, Golden Days.Their choir singing is plainly heard in their harmonised vocals giving a beautully calming sound, invoking memories of listening to Enya in the bathtub.

It starts with an idea focusing on a particular topic and then grows around that.#Kirsteen said: #Every moment a song comes together for the first time, hearing us singing it is such a buzz.#When asked what they thought of MOJO, Alana said: #Genuinely, MOJO was amazing. It was the first time we’ve performed an entire set of all our own work, which was pretty special.#Kirsteen said: #MOJO and the reception we got performing our own music for the first time was very special.#When asked where they would most like to perform, there was some surprisingly touching answers.Alana said: #I personally would love to play in Nashville, the country capital in the Bluebird Cafe. That would be my absolute dream.#Kirsteen said: #I would have loved my dad to hear our songs, but next best, a live performance to my brother who lives in New Zealand during our world tour would be fabulous.#But no one is squeaky clean, and the duo revealed their biggest secret.Alana said: #I’ve randomly been singing Mambo No  by Lou Bega all weekend. That#s my guilty pleasure. My favourite song of all time is Hotel Calornia by the Eagles, so maybe that will allow me to redeem myself.#Kirsteen said: #I#m a sucker for some Abba.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Five primary schools in the area were ordered to raise standards by Education Scotland inspectors. They include Catrine, Logan and Drongan and Kilmarnock schools Hillhead and Mount Carmel. Four of the schools: Drongan, Logan, Catrine and Mount Carmel have seen head teacher changes since the inspections took place. Hillhead got a new school boss shortly before the Education Scotland visit. The recently recruited heads appeared before a council meeting to report on progress this week. Commenting on the shake-up of leadership in the schools, Councillor George Mair said it “seems to be head teachers disappear”.

But he added: “What has been going on before  What is the problem with head teachers ”  Committee chairman Councillor Barry Douglas said: “We are not here to discuss inidual head teachers.” The council’s chief governance officer David Mitchell said there is a link between the strength and quality of leadership in schools and reports received. The meeting heard about the status at each school with the new heads giving updates to councillors.

I have had a lot of support from the local authority and my colleagues, which is appreciated.” A report presented to the meeting said: “An experienced head teacher within the local authority was re-deployed within the school.  Progress at the school is now rated satisfactory and good at the nursery. Another update on the primary from the council is due at a later date. Sean Maddocks has just become acting head of Drongan Primary and nursery. Both the school and nursery received two weak and satisfactory scores in May from Education Scotland.

Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo.

What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire.

I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges. Working out whether cuts or charges are the best way forward, whilst protecting the vulnerable, will make this yearrsquos budget no easy task. This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further. I am hoping that the budget will provide an opportunity to improve the position."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-for-140-holiday-lodges-at-former-golf-course","story":"Whitekirk Hill, which already has planning permission to revamp the clubhouse at the former Whitekirk Golf and Country Club, hopes to build ldquocirca  holiday lodges and woodland pods on the site.Debate centring on the development, which will be determined by the councilrsquos planning committee, has been ongoing for months.Tony Thomas, representing Whitekirk Hill, said: ldquoWhitekirk Hill Ltd is delighted to reach this milestone after months of hard work completing the environmental impact assessment .

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month.

For while Labour grandee Peter Mandelson famously said that history would remember Mr Cameron ldquosimply as the prime minister who took us out of the EU, the legacy of another of the former member for Witneyrsquos bright ideas - austerity - shows just how unfit for office he really is.Dreamed up by Mr Cameron and fellow Bullingdon BoyGeorge Osborne - who, inexplicably, has reinvented himself as the Tory-bashing newspaper editor par excellence - austerity was announced in  as the antidote to the Labour Partyrsquos preceding ldquoage of irresponsibility. With the country brought low by unscrupulous bankers and misguided borrowers - not to mention profligate Labour politicians - the time had apparently come for us all to tighten our belts for the good of the nation.Yet while Mr Osbornersquos ldquowersquore all in this together mantra rang hollow right from the off, the extent to which austerity has ravaged the poor while allowing the rich to amble along just fine was last week laid bare in a damning report from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Indeed, thanks to austerity measures such as the introduction of what Mr Alston termed ldquoUniversal Discredit,  million people in the UK are now living in poverty, with the poor, women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, single parents, and people with disabilities most severely affected. Not only is this shameful in a nation that boasts the worldrsquos fth largest economy but, as Mr Alston said, it is ldquopatently unjust and contrary to British values.Nor can Scotland claim the moral high ground. Though the UN report noted that we have the lowest poverty rates of any UK nation, Scottish Government figures show that the number of people living in relative poverty north of the Border has increased by  per cent since the advent of austerity, from , in   to a million in  , , of whom are children. And while the Alston report praised measures such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fairer Scotland Action Plan and said its nascent benefits agency is ldquoguided by the principles of dignity and social security as a human right, the author stressed that accountability has not been written into the system while no mechanism is in place to ensure the most vulnerable can access what assistance is available to them.When he announced his age of austerity David Cameron said the intention was to show that ldquofiscal responsibility can go hand in hand with a social conscience. It is about as far from a ringing endorsement as you can get that Mr Alston has found the exact opposite to be the case, with his report highlighting that ldquoBritish compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instil discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with todayrsquos world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the wellbeing of those at the lowest levels of British society. Whether or not the policy has been ldquofiscally responsible, meanwhile, remains moot.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough, Warwick University economics professor Thiemo Fetzer published a paper earlier this year that drew a direct link between austerity and Brexit, with the deep cuts to welfare from  onwards thought to be responsible for pushing many in the UKrsquos most disadvantaged communities into the arms of UKIP and the vote-Leave camp. Sold on the promise of a new dawn of Great British prosperity, those voters - like the rest of us - are now forced to live in a country so economically damaged that the Financial Times reckons the average household is pound a year worse off than it was before the vote. What that figure will be once we make our final, shambolic exit from the European Union is anyonersquos guess, though we can all rest assured that it is highly unlikely to be heading south.Given his role in getting us into this mess, the idea that Mr Cameron is our best hope for getting out of it is far-fetched in the extreme. Whether he meant to or not, our former prime minister inflicted great misery on the UK the day he declared a new age of austerity, with his Brexit gamble only serving to compound the effect.The Tory Party under Theresa May may be intent on ripping itself ndash and the country ndash apart right now, but Mr Cameron is not the answer. Austerity and Brexit are indefensible allowing him to heap yet more misery on the people of the UK would be utterly unforgivable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-proclaimers-to-play-edinburgh-castle-as-they-announce-four-special-gigs","story":"The band will play inEdinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Melrose as part of their tour in support of their new album Angry Cyclist.The band will play a big top tents at Melrose Rugby Club on June  and Inverness Bught Park on July .They will also play Edinburgh Castle for the first time in a decade on July  before rounding off the-monthtour at Glasgows Hydro on September .Read more:The Proclaimers demand law change as touts sell tickets for their new tour for nearly poundThe Proclaimers, brother, Craig and Charlie Reid, said: \"We are looking forward immensely to coming home during the summer for four major Scottish shows.

That would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.\"In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs Mays Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid would vote against the withdrawal deal at a special EU summit on SundayGibraltars future was not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.ldquoIn the past  hours, none of the documents has claried something which is fundamental for us: Gibraltar is not part of the UK, declared Mr Sanchez.ldquoAs a country, we cannot assume what is going to happen in the future with regard to GibraltarhellipIt should be negotiated between Spain and the UK.

Number  hopes that everyonersquos minds will be addled by John Lewis Christmas ads by then, and that Labour will abandon its facile suggestion that it can go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Angela Merkel herself has spoken ndash the answer is ldquoNein, danke.The -page document has been so tightly drafted, and language so massaged and manipulated, that itrsquos passed the stage when words have any fixed meaning. Constitutional lawyers think that some concessions have been made to the UK ndash at least in distancing the European Court of Justice from dispute resolution. But the Luxembourg court is still there, in the background, standing as the ultimate authority on all those aspects of EU law Britain accepts: state aid, environment, workplace regulations, trade marks and so on...:Letters: What the country needs now is politicians of principleSimilarly, while Northern Ireland wonrsquot remain formally in the European single market after Brexit, it will be more closely integrated with the European Union than the UK. There will be regulatory ergence. As Theresa May has admitted, firms located there will have a competitive advantage: frictionless access to the single market. Goods entering the EU from the rUK will be subject to checks. Therersquos no getting round this, however opaque the language.The document is a masterpiece of obfuscation, weasel words, circumlocutions and qualications, which suits both sides right now. Brussels knows it can roll back from much of the deal after March when Britain has formally left the EU and paid its bill. Mrs May just wants to get past the March exit date, so she can get a le. The agreement really only covers the Irish backstop, the orce bill and the rights of EU citizens. If the negotiations on the future trading relations are successful, Mrs May insists, the Irish backstop may never be needed. But these negotiations havenrsquot begun. As soon as this document is agreed, the whole dismal process begins again. Another two years of legal wrangling, red lines, ultimatums, delays and last minute compromise.In fact, the transition period is already being extended to , and could go on to ldquoXX according to the Political Declaration. The UK will certainly remain in the EU orbit for many years, eventhere is that Canada plus Norway minus Switzerland-type deal that Mrs May envisages. Itrsquos mind-numbing. If only someone could just stop the whole process now, Irsquom pretty sure most British voters would accept it. Theyrsquore past the point of capitulation and worrying about their sanity.:Questions over governmentrsquos battle to stop Brexit legal caseAll credit to Nicola Sturgeon, therefore, for holding talks with Labour in Westminster about halting the Brexit process by delaying Article , which formally takes us out of the European Union in  days. She says her MPs would endorse a Peoplersquos Vote on staying in the EU. This is good ndashunfortunately, there seems vanishingly little chance of them having the opportunity so to do. Scotland getting a special deal like Northern Ireland or remaining in the single market. Scotland fell off the Brexit map after the aborted independence referendum in , and no longer counts.Mrs May is clearly not willing to call a Peoplersquos Vote, and shersquos not going anywhere. The Prime Ministerrsquos authority has been greatly enhanced by the stupidity of the Brexiters. They staged a premature leadership challenge and, effectively, lost it by not delivering the numbers for a no confidence vote. Just about sums up their entire self-deluded approach.Labourrsquos still hoping for a General Election, even though therersquos no chance of getting one. If and when Labour MPs vote against Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement next month, the Government wonrsquot fall. There needs to be a two-thirds majority to force an election, and Tory MPs wonrsquot vote for an early Christmas. The Prime Minister will simply come back to the house with a face-saving amendment or two, perhaps agreeing to extend British participation in the customs union or ldquoterritory beyond the backstop.By then there will be huge pressure on Labour to sign up to her deal ndash not just from the PM. The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, Michel Barnier, Angela Merkell, the CBI, the UK presswill all be screaming for Labour to endorse this deal as the only way of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Is Labour really going to walk through the lobbies, with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, to vote for chaos at the ports, a stock-market crash, the Army on the streets and tens of thousands of Labour voters laid off work Labourrsquos grounds for opposing the Withdrawal Agreement are anyway paper thin. Eventhe negotiations could be restarted before March, what would Labour be asking for  Jeremy Corbyn doesnrsquot want the ldquoNorway Option of staying in the EU single market, because that would involve free movement. He doesnrsquot want to stay in the EU Customs Union either, only ldquoa customs union, which Labour says it would negotiate. But Theresa May has already been there, done that.Anyway, Mr Corbyn wants Brexit, a ldquojobs Brexit to succeed. He is avoiding any firm commitment to a Peoplersquos Vote, which would undermine Labour in English Brexit constituencies. I doubtMs Sturgeon is going to persuade him otherwise. Labour may not avoid voting, in the end, for withdrawal under EU terms.So we have it. Britain plunges ahead into a Blind Brexit no one wants, leaving the EU, and all its benefits, without any future trade deal. Itrsquos a self-inflicted disaster that historians will argue over for the next century: how a great nation simply took leave of its senses."},{"url":null,"title":"householders-face-tens-of-thousands-of-pounds-of-debt-over-rogue-energy-firm-linked-to-uk-government","story":"Citizens Advice Scotlandhas demanded the UK Government take action to help customers who have been let down by Home Energy and Lestyle Management Systems , which has since gone into liquidation.Consumer experts are aware of , complaints about the company, but fear this could be the tip of the iceberg.Experts also believe householders may have complained to their MP about the firm in addition to CAS which said almost  per cent of its complaints were about the company.The Green Deal energy scheme helped consumers pay for energy efficiency measures in their homes such as solar .

Of  Green Deal loans in Scotland from HELMS, % of them have payback period of  years or more.\"Anyone aged  or above taking out a loan could be stuck with this until they reach pension age and clearly older tenants should never have been allowed to access finance over such a period.\"Derek Mitchell, chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland said consumers were entitled to be treated fairly and expect action to be taken taken when they are not.He said: \"A company like HELMS should not have been able to treat people as it did, and while they are undoubtedly the bad guys here, there are clear lessons to be learned about how to make sure this does not happen again.\"But for now our main focus is on the people who have suffered at the hands of this company. That is why we are calling on the UK government to ensure every HELMS client is contacted.\"He said CAS had great respect for those who have sought redress so far, but suspected they were just the \"tip of the iceberg\".Mr Mitchell added that the government must ensure every complaint about HELMS or its associated companies is independently investigated and redress is provided.A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"Where customers believe they have been mis-sold they are able to take their complaints direct to the Green Deal Finance Companywho can cancel or reduce loansthe evidence supports this.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-what-the-country-needs-now-is-politicians-of-principle","story":"That is the nub of the matter. The effect on society has now become secondary to political dogma. We are in this current predicament because a weak Tory Government is in thrall to a right wing which wishes to turn us back into a lone, island nation in the Atlantic, yearning for the days of Empire. The Labour Opposition will vote against whatever deal is proposed regardless of whether it is the land of milk and honey promised by the leading Brexiters. Its sole aim is to discomfit the Government in an attempt to force an election and thereby gain power. The SNP see the shambles as a godsend in their pursuit of independence.Oh, for politicians like Teddy Taylor, John Smith or Charles Kennedy whose aimwas the good of their constituents and our nation.Jim Coley,Calderwood Road, Rutherglen, Glasgow.THE pages of history are littered with examples where the stubbornness and determination of a leader have simply served to worsen what was already a desperate situation. While Theresa May has to be commended for her survival skills, we surely have reached a point where her actions are compounding the serious errors of judgement that have characterised her troubled premiership.Having campaigned, albeit somewhat half-heartedly, to Remain, she succeeded David Cameron and proceeded to give key Cabinet posts to arch-Brexiters whose febrile anti-EU rhetoric has come back to haunt her. She has consistently failed to take them on and to discipline them for their all-too obvious disloyalty to her premiership.Presumably it was to appease them that she made the awful mistake of triggering Article  in March . By doing this she set the exit clock ticking before any serious due diligence had been carried out as to the drastic consequences of Brexit for the UK. As a result, we are playing a desperate game of catch-up. Scarcely a week goes by without another sector of our community flagging up serious worries and concerns. Permanent damage has already been done, witness the number of companies and organisations choosing now to relocate where. They are highly unlikely to ever come back to the UK. Some of this harm could at least have been predicted and considered before that fateful triggering of Article .Then in April , Mrs May opportunistically called a General Election rather than wait for  as laid down in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act . Here was yet another mistake as with her Parliamentary majority gone, she has had to rely on the dubious ndash and costly ndash support of the DUP.To make matters worse, in September  in her Florence speech, Mrs May laid down the \"red lines\" that would underpin the UKrsquos negotiating position. It was clear at once that her determination to leave the customs union and to end the free movement of EU nationals threatened aof a hard Irish border. To believe that the EU would compromise on its founding principles to accommodate the departing UK was fatally flawed.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN your coverage of the Brexit crisis, you carried a piece with the headline \"Mundell may quitUK tied to EU fishing\"which I read in conjunction with Owen Kellyrsquos description of David Mundellas lsquothis most inconsequential of politicians\". Why our Secretary of Statersquos apparent threat of resigning merits a headline is beyond me ndash frankly, who would notice, or care,he did go  Mr Kellyrsquos description is quite accurate, and I hardly think Theresa May is going to lose any sleep over Mr Mundellrsquos eventual decision around his recently-acquired interest in the fishing industry.At another level, it is of some consequence that we have a Secretary of State unable to make any political utterance that doesnrsquot include a Pavlovian request to the SNP to take a second independence referendum off the table. Constructive policies, as with Ruth Davidson, are nowhere to be seen. In this respect, Mr Mundellrsquos vacuity is emblematic, of course, of the Toriesrsquo indference to Scotland and its distinctive needs. So perhaps he has the usefulof reminding us of this, and holding it in mind come the next election. In the meantime, my advice to Mr Mundell is: just go now, and go back to your knitting.Dr Angus Macmillan, Georgetown Road, Dumfries.AS a citizen of Scotland, the UK and Europe I would urge First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP not to get into bed ndash metaphorically speaking ndash with the ideological purists and the to-hell-with-the-consequences led by Jacob Rees-Mogg by voting down the agreed deal between the EU and the UK.It would be absurd and sad to see the progressive SNP vote on the same side as a bunch of reactionary Tories. Surely that cannot and will not happen.As independent-minded people I am sure that our Westminster SNP members can see the reckless folly of the path being pursued by Mr Rees-Mogg and his cohorts. If they cannot then Britain and particularly Scotland will pay a high price.David McMillan, Strathmore Avenue, Paisley.NICOLA Sturgeon faces signicant challenges ahead,she attempts to demand an independence referendum be held in the short to medium term.She was of course rejected in March  by Theresa May because of Brexit uncertainty. Eighteen months on its clear \"now is [still] not the time\". The UK Government is in a state of massive upheaval and seemingly no one has a clear view of what Brexit may mean, or indeed whether itll definitely happen. Possibly Mrs Mays compromise will be rejected by the Commons we may have a new prime minister and or there may be another General Election leading to either a Labour or a Tory government ndash theyre close in opinion polls. Should or can another deal be negotiated with Brussels  Will there be another EU referendum ndash and what question would be asked  Again opinion polls predict another close result.\"Now is not the time\" is an even more appropriate response to the SNP leader than last March.Brexit may be the drama du jour but our relationship with the EU will feature heavily in British politics for many years.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has highlighted concerns over delays in issuing flu jabs to over-s in Orkney with the Scottish Government.

Descendants of both Vice Admiral Fremantle and Rear Admiral von Reuter will be attending the conference.The conference will cover not only the scuttle, but also the history and impact of that fateful day.Speakers will explore the American navy#s vital role in the war, how the scuttle was interpreted in Germany and how the legacy still lives on today.Six months before the centenary itself, this will be a wonderful opportunity to share Scapa#s history, stimulate ideas for  and build a lasting knowledge of what happened and why.Nick Jellicoe will publish two books next year: The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet and, in partnership with the Orcadian, Scuttle to Salvage, a book about in photographs. He is shortly launching a website to support the centenary, Scapaflow and will be producing another animation The Scapa Flow Naval History Conference will take place at Kirkwall Grammar School, Friday and Saturday, November  and .Details on the conference can be found on https:shop.scapaflow copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Wednesday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

According to Theresa May, Brexit might even not happen at all: she’s now saying we can have no deal, her deal, or no Brexit. Only a few ideologues, on right and left, want no deal. Her deal isn’t a deal at all. It’s a promise to have a deal in two or three or four years’ time. Parliament looks like throwing her plan out anyway. No Brexit flies in the face of the referendum result. To navigate our way out of such a shambles, we have to be frank about how we got into it.It began with a lie: that Britain could leave the EU but still keep all the advantages of membership. We could walk away from the responsibilities and irritations of political union, but still claim all the benefits of the economic union that comes with it. The EU would be so keen to keep us, they’d agree whatever we asked for. We’d be inside it and outside at the same time – inside for the bits we liked, outside for the bits we didn’t. Cake could be had and eaten.Then we moved from cake to fudge. To keep the Tory party together, Mrs May’s approach has been to fudge, postponing the day of reckoning until after we’ve left. No choice had to be made. We can become both Canada and Norway. She’s still trying. It hasn’t united her party, and reality has caught up with her anyway. The rubber hit the road at the Irish border, but this isn’t really an Irish question. Leaving the EU is all about setting up new borders, for trade and regulation. It just happens that the only land border we have with the EU is that fractal line round six Irish counties which we’ve repeatedly promised would never be a hard border again. By its own lights, the EU has been reasonable, accommodating Mrs May’s ambiguity and fudge, but no amount of flexibility can avoid the fact that the EU’s border has to be somewhere, and we have to be inside it or outside it. Remember Schrödinger’s cat, in a box and supposedly alive and dead the same time  The point is that, when you open the box, it turns out to be one or the other.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysThat’s what Mrs May’s supposed deal tries to avoid: opening the box – making up our mind about the future relationship. But the Irish backstops remind us we must decide whether to be in or out of the EU’s customs and regulatory borders. Out means a border of some sort, either on the island of Ireland or across the Irish Sea. This basic contradiction in the Prime Minister’s position was willed on her by a split party, but her terrible tactics have made things worse. Triggering Article  put a gun to Britain’s head. She didn’t have to set the deadline we are now staring at. Her negotiating position was a criss-cross of red lines, ruling the possible out, and only the impossible in.Now, in the endgame, her tactics could do irreparable harm. Her deal will not survive parliament. Too many oppose it. She needs DUP support, but they know how to say No. Brexiteers denounce her. They cannot depose her, but won’t vote for her plan. Otherwise loyal Tories despair of her. She’s tells her party it’s her deal or no deal: take what’s on the table, or leave with nothing – no transition, no trade deal, no protection for citizens’ rights – only disruption and chaos. But they won’t all vote for it. Nor will the opposition.: Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit challengeWhen her deal falls, perhaps we’ll get a new government, maybe after an election. But the underlying problem remains: there’s no magic fix, and the EU is not going to reopen negotiations to listen to more fantasies. They might agree to our leaving the EU but staying in the customs union and single market. That’s what happens in the transition period, and is close to where the proposed backstop will likely take us anyway. This has been promoted by the SNP and is close to Labour policy. It’s clear and simple, but problematic. Outside a political union but in an economic union, the UK would have no say in many of its laws.Meantime, however, Mrs May’s tactics have changed signicantly. So far, she’s threatened no deal to frighten Tory remainers. Now she’s decided to threaten the Brexiteers too, with no Brexit. They’re not both going swallow it. Soher plan falls but her government doesn’t, she will end up offering either no deal or no Brexit.That isn’t a choice for the Government, or even for Parliament, but for the people. They voted for Brexit when told it would be easy. Faced with the no deal prospect – the Government is apparently planning for chaos, even soldiers guarding petrol stations – the choice must go back to the population in another referendum. People in all political parties are now supporting this. Some on the Conservative backbenches, many in the Labour Party , and the Lib Dems and SNP also. If the country faces such a possibility, they all need to get together to deliver a People’s Vote.Let’s not deceive ourselves. Having another referendum might avoid the chaos of no deal, but doesn’t solve every problem. The big political lesson of this decade is that referendums create ision. Remainers might think that another vote will be the end of the matter, but the country needs to address that ision and the economic and social concerns of those who voted leave.

The Cairns of Coll are so small that you have to look quite hard for them on the map, but there they are, some of them not much more than an expanse of rock raised up from the surrounding sea. The largest island is about  acres, a low hill that discloses signs of ancient occupation but is now home only to seabirds and, at its edges, colonies of seals. On one, the most northerly, a small Stevenson lighthouse sits, powered by solar energy, dutully sending out its warning to passing vessels.You can beach a boat here on one of the slopes of pure white sand. You can explore the low saliences that afford a view of the Hebridean Sea to the west, of Rhum, Muck and Eigg to the north, and of the high ramparts of Skye beyond. With exception of the lighthouse, nowhere are the works of man to be seen. There is a beauty here that is beyond price in a world where such places are becoming more and more sullied by the pressure of human population – and by the relentless human desire for more of everything.I was in the fortunate position of being able to buy these islands from the person in Barra who was selling them. Her family had looked after them for years and now she wanted to hand them over. I have no plans to do anything with them – they are to remain pristine, a natural reserve in a world that is increasingly being covered in concrete or stripped of its plants. They will be there for those who can get to them – most often, people going out on whale watching or nature cruises – or for sailors who are able to go ashore and picnic and explore. Divers sometimes land on them and explore the rich seabed around them. I go out there once or twice a year and just stand and breathe in the air and close my eyes, knowing that I am being watched by curious seals, their heads popping up out of the surrounding waters. If anybody really owns these islands, it is those seals.: Kelp ban branded a ‘chilling’ message for scientistsThe marine environment in that part of Scotland is now being threatened by a proposal to license the large-scale commercial harvesting of kelp from the sea-bed. This will involve mechanical removal of kelp forests, essentially stripping them out by their holdfast. The proponents of these schemes say that this can be done only in limited areas and that there will be little overall damage to the seabed and the le systems it sustains. There is weighty evidence from many reputable marine scientists that contradicts this. This technology will destroy the habitat of fish and many other creatures. Our kelp forests should be left untouched – completely. It is no good saying that only a little will be taken , tonnes a year – what the scheme proposes to take – is too much. Even , tonnes a year would be too much for the bit of the sea bed affected.Opposition to this scheme has come from many quarters. No less a naturalist than David Attenborough, whose credentials in the defence of nature are above question, has joined the clamour of protest. Local communities, including fishermen, have made known their opposition to what is proposed. A petition against the proposal has been signed by thousands of people who live in the area and who have a stake in preserving our precious marine environment frm destruction. The matter is to be voted on at Holyrood today. : Kelp dredging  Why it’s time to stop pundering the sea – Jonny HughesEverybody understands that we have to make some use of the sea and that we cannot always leave nature undisturbed. But surely we have to be extremely cautious that any intervention we make in the marine environment is kept to the minimum, and that in particular we should we should avoid industrial activities that will inevitably destroy signicant areas of the marine habitat. Kelp can be harvested, but must be cut by hand, on a controlled scale, rather than left to the mercy of marine combine harvesters.What we lose we cannot always get back. Our poor world is reeling, and as it reels, the metaphors abound. We are now in injury time when it comes to global warming the nuclear disaster clock is set at a few minutes to midnight. Scotland is a tiny bit of our natural world, but it is a precious and lovely part of it. Holyrood is its steward. Those who sit there must listen to the conservationists and scientists who are trying to get them to hear a simple, urgent message: don’t do this.I think of the Cairns of Coll. I think of those waters, those hills, those breathtakingly lovely places that make up the world of the Hebridean islands. The underlying eco-system will unquestionably be harmedlarge scale harvesting of kelp is allowed. There will be fewer fish. There will be less protection for the shoreline. Little marine deserts will be created. So, little by little, we destroy the things we love and need.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832523.1542731038!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence unionists wrong about new poll linda fabiani","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland in Union#s bid to secure an opinion poll to support their vision of Brexit Britain has badly backfired, writes Linda Fabiani.For all their self-confessed attempts to engineer a question which deliberately seeks to conflate independence with Brexit, the findings offer them little comfort.Aside from confirming the SNP’s commanding lead for both Holyrood and Westminster, the poll also shows that Brexit is set to boost support for an independent Scotland.: Poll: % of Scots would back ‘remain’ in new Scottish independence voteAnd the headline finding is clearly an outlier from almost every other independence poll conducted since September , most of which show support for independence at or above the  per cent the Yes vote achieved then.The truth is that independence is the very opposite of Brexit.: Scottish independence: If UK didn’t exist, we’d invent it – Pamela NashInstead of the insular, parochial, backward-looking worldview offered by the Tories – and defended to the hilt by people like Pamela Nash of Scotland in Union, whatever the cost to Scotland – independence is about Scotland taking its place in the world as an equal partner.That is what makes Ms Nash’s suggestion thatthe UK didn’t exist it would have to be invented so risible.: Readers’ poll: Would you vote for Scottish independence in a second referendum To suggest that anyone would opt to join the chaotic, dysal sinking ship that the UK has become under the Tories is stretching credulity beyond breaking point.Does anyone believe, to indulge Ms Nash’s claim a bit further, thatScotland was already independent then people would vote to be governed by the current shambles of a government at Westminster The fact is, as the poll also confirms, unionist scare stories about independence are crumbling one by one.: Nicola Sturgeon: Decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’The poll shows that people in Scotland overwhelmingly think an independent Scotland would be granted EU membership – something the Spanish foreign minister has just confirmed his government would not oppose, thereby demolishing a favourite  Project Fear scare story.Then, Scotland was told that the only way to protect our future in Europe was to vote no to independence.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues.

However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing. The bans, which were pretty lenient in any case, should stay. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"mid yell shetland ","story":"Guide Price* £,+A rare opportunity to acquire a former local shop in the heart of a rural community.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates -

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"strike continues at north belfast school","story":"TEACHERS at St Patrick’s Primary School held a second day of strike action on Tuesday in a protest at “the culture” in which they are expected to work.Members of the NASUWT union at the school began the first of six planned days of strike action last Tuesday.The union said that the work environment at the school is having an “adverse impact on theirworking conditions, their health and wellbeing.”Further strike action is planned for tomorrow , Tuesday , Wednesday  and Thursday  of November.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand Board of Governors at St Patrick’s had previously called for dialogue, appealing to the NASUWT to call off the strike.While strike action has gone ahead as planned thus far, NASUWT said it was willing to engage in negotiations.Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official, said: “While many issues of workplace stress are generated by wider pressures around budgets, many of the issues in St Patrick’s arise from how situations are dealt with at a local level. These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"allister dismayed at ufus support for mays brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Have you forgotten the business supply chain is a two way process and therefore, rushing to impede GB NI trade is as dangerous as it is absurd \"However, the bosses of the UKs four major farming unions show no sign of backing down. A joint statement on behalf of the UFU, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said: \"We have argued for free and frictionless trade with the EU to continue, with no tarfs or non-tarf barriers.\"The default of trading with the EU under WTO rules alone is unacceptable and would decimate our industry.\"The draft Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food  drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.\"Yesterday, Hospitality Ulster published a poll indicating that three quarters of businesses it asked here in a survey supported the May deal. The industry body said: \"The current draft agreement to exit the EU is far from perfect, and still causes some concern, but when faced with a no deal scenario, % of respondents to our industry poll support its acceptance, whilst recognising that further clarication on a number of issues is still required.\"We believe the current draft agreement is commercially better than a no deal scenario and will support the wider domestic economy on which our members depend, providing a framework for unfettered access to goods and services and visa free access for EU visitors to support the growing tourism market.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exharland wolff boss raps selfindulgent mps opposed to draft brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are not acting in the interests of the British people.

Ex-Harland  Wolff boss raps self-indulgent MPs opposed to draft Brexit deal Northern Ireland still to receive £m of Tories £bn deal with DUPAllister dismayed at UFUs support for Mays Brexit dealLast night, the Government was forced to cave in to a raft of Labour demands to amend the Finance Bill, as it could not rely on DUP votes in the House of Commons. Labour accused Mrs May of being \"in office but not in power\" and her Government of \"falling apart\".It casts doubt on the future of Mrs Mays confidence and supply arrangement with the  DUP MPs, secured with a controversial £bn funding deal for Northern Ireland.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Its absolutely staggering that the Government has accepted all Labour amendments to the Finance Bill because it couldnt rely upon the DUPs support. The Tories are in office but not in power. Were watching a government falling apart in front of us.\"The Government climbdown and unwillingness to force votes came after the DUP voted with Labour once and abstained five times during Finance Bill votes on Monday. Yesterday, Mr Dodds had made clear the DUP was ready to continue voting against the Government and called on Mrs May to dump her exit plan.The North Belfast MP said: \"With the rejection of the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement on all sides of the House and across all parties, it is increasingly clear this deal does not have support necessary to pass the meaningful vote in Parliament. Unionists in Northern Ireland, and indeed unionists across the UK, are appalled at the constitutional implications of the deal.\"While the DUP had \"kept to our word\" on the agreement, the resignation of several Tory ministers showed that Mrs Mays deal \"does not represent those shared objectives\", he said.He added: \"The Government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom.\"If the Government can look beyond a Withdrawal Agreement, which is uniting people from across the political spectrum against it, and instead work towards a better deal, then an outcome can be delivered that truly works to benefit all parts of the United Kingdom.\"Shortly afterwards, the Impartial Reporter, a Co Fermanagh newspaper, reported that leading Brexiteer and former foreign minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond are due to attend the DUPs conference at the weekend.And last night, former DUP MP Rev Willie McCrea used his maiden speech in the House of Lords - traditionally reserved for uncontroversial issues - to argue the proposed Withdrawal Agreement would \"drive a coach and horses\" through devolution.Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown said the draft Brexit deal \"threatens the integrity\" of the UK.Speaking in the upper chamber, the veteran politician insisted the draft document was \"not a good deal\" for the UK and warned his party would reject it.Lord McCrea said: \"If these proposals were implemented, we in Northern Ireland would have to take rules from a body without any representation, governed by laws which eventhey damaged our economy could not be changed and which we have no say in. These proposals drive a coach and horses through the devolution settlement and our constitutional practices, to suit the European Union.\"But in a move likely to be welcomed by Brexiteers, No. confirmed the Government would look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish border open. Mrs Mays spokesman confirmed that references in last weeks draft agreement to \"alternative arrangements\" for the border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the \"maximum facilitation\" solution, or Max Fac.And last night, Independent Unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon revealed she had a \"constructive and at all times amicable\" meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday night over concerns she had about the plan.\"During that meeting I raised a number of issues with her and it was agreed No. would let me have written clarication on those points,\" she said. \"In addition, since the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement are already written into the Withdrawal Agreement, I suggested it would be helpful to repeat those in a separate political declaration.\"Meanwhile, the Tanaiste has said the draft agreement is not open for renegotiation.Simon Coveney said it should no longer be considered a draft and that instead it should be seen as the only agreement. Mr Coveney told the Dail that it was \"not going to be re-opened\".\"This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government. So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it is now the text, and it is not going to be reopened,\" he said.Mr Coveney said the text should not be changed at this stage because it had taken two years to put together.\"Its sensitive, its dficult. Its a compromise on both sides, by the UK and the EU, trying to accommodate each others concerns.\"Mrs May is scheduled to travel to Brussels today to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of a special EU summit on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast primary school teachers take to streets for second day of strikes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I like bringing a smile to people’s faces.”Mr Porsz caught the photography bug when he bought a camera after his first child Simon was born in .He looked to the streets of Peterborough for inspiration and quickly developed a passion for street photography. He later decided to hone his craft by visiting other cities.“Over the years I’ve tried to visit as many cities as possible. I’ll spend hours walking around, taking hundreds of photos and often deleting lots to,” he said.“Sometimes I set my stage and waited for someone to walk past, such as with a billboard or a statue. Other times I managed to snap unusual interactions that most people would just blindly walk past.A Belfast family enjoying the weather“Some cities were full of characters, such as Brighton, and it was easy to get lots of good pictures, but others I had to keep ing to until I got what I needed. I’ve tried to capture a snapshot of a day in each of the cities.”Mr Porsz said it could be frustrating when someone walked in front of the camera at the wrong time or he missed the moment but other pictures would make up for it.He added: “My near misses would fill another book, but any moments of dejection and self-doubt are soon forgotten when I see a man in Newcastle wearing a pink suit and a horse’s head, or a pensioner walking around Nottingham with an owl on his arm, as you do.Pub le in Belfast“I cannot resist snapping the drunken hens and their inevitable ‘here I am, tadar!’ pose. Every town too, has its fire and brimstone brigade so I just wait patiently for a ‘sinner’ to come along to make a lucky juxtaposition.”He said his work as a paramedic at Peterborough City Hospital helped with his street photography as he was able to “reassure complete strangers” and “react instinctively to the unexpected\".“My favourite cities were Edinburgh, Glasgow and Brighton, which were teaming with interesting characters and opportunities,” he said.Youngsters play fighting by the Big Fish of Knowledge“Although in Glasgow I found that I was hugged by some guys and challenged by others when I tried to take a photo. I’ve discovered that people don’t seem to mind having their picture taken by a mobile phone but can be suspicious of big cameras.”Sometimes Mr Porsz would talk to the subjects of his photos and discover an exciting story.The front cover of his book is one of his favourites.“The lady was about  and lived in Peterborough and was describing how as a young girl on Bonfire Night she set off a rocket and it went through the window of a policeman’s house and burnt it down.“Although it looks like she is giving the finger, she is actually putting her finger up to demonstrate the rocket going in the air.”Mr Porsz published another book - Reunions - two years ago, which reunited people he had photographed  years earlier. Last year he published Streets of Europe.Contact him on www.chrisporsz or message him on FB or Twitter to order your copy.

Ahead of the meeting the North Down MP said she required \"personal assurances\" before committing her support to the draft withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK. Lady Hermon told the Belfasther meeting with the Prime Minister had been \"constructive and at all times amicable\". \"During that meeting I raised a number of issues with her and it was agreed No  would let me have written clarication on those points,\" she said. \"In addition, since the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement are already written into the withdrawal agreement I suggested it would be helpful to repeat those in a separate political declaration.\"The principal of consent included in the the Good Friday Agreement refers to the clause for self-determination, and that Northern Ireland should remain British - or become part of a united Ireland - depending on the will of the majority of the people. A vote on the deal agreed between the United Kingdom and the EU is expected in early December and doubts have been expressed on whether the Government will be able to secure sufficient backing for it in the House of Commons. The DUP is staunchly opposed to the withdrawal agreement in its current form due to the Irish backstop proposal included within it. Tensions over the deal have led to a straining of the confidence and supply agreement between the DUP and the Conservative Government. On Monday and Tuesday nights the DUP abstained and voted against amendments to the Finance Bill put before the House of Commons. In its agreement with Theresa Mays Government the DUP agreed to give its support to votes on budgetary matters. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said the action did not mean the end of the confidence and supply agreement, but should be taken as a warning to the Government.

The   report is based on a response rate of %, with , iniduals aged  and over taking part.According to the most recent statistics, % of youngsters aged between two and  were classed as overweight, while % were deemed obese - a similar level since  .More worryingly, over a quarter of adultswere categorised as obese, with a further % classed as overweight in  . Obesity levels have shown an upward trend from the % recorded seven years ago, with males more likely to be overweight than females.Margaret Carr, Cancer Research UKs public affairs manager in Northern Ireland, said the findings were alarming. \"Carrying too much weight is responsible for around  cases of cancer in Northern Ireland every year, including breast and bowel, so its deeply concerning so many people here are too heavy,\" she said.\"Swt action is needed including the pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV, as well as tighter regulations for online ads. \"These measures would go a long way towards protecting the health of future generations.\" Around one-fth of peoplesmoke cigarettes - a fall of % from last year and % since   - as the use of electronic cigarettes increased by %.But smoking in the most deprived areas surveyed was still as high as %, three times higher than in affluent areas .Ms Carr said that although the percentage of people smoking is lower than last year, it could be due to natural iation. \"It is disappointing that so many people in Northern Ireland are still smoking,\" she said. \"Smoking is the largest preventable cause of cancer, causing around , cases in Northern Ireland every year. It is hard to quit, but theres help available. Studies show that those who use stop smoking services are four times more likely to stay off cigarettes, so seeking support is well worth while.\"The survey also found that around three quarters of respondents aged  and over drink alcohol, equating to % of men and % of women.It showed that men are three times more likely than women to drink too much. Only % of women were found to drink more than the recommended weekly limit but % of men did.The proportion of respondents drinking above recommended weekly levels has, however, fallen from almost a quarterin   to % this year.There was also a sizeable drop in numbers eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day from a high of % in   to % this year.Around a fth of those surveyedshowed signs of a possible mental health problem, with those from the most deprived areasmore likely to be affected than those in the least deprived areas .Women were more likely to feel lonely than men, with % showing signs of loneliness compared to % of men. Those living in urban, deprived areas were the most likely to be lonely, with rural, wealthy people less likely.For the full study, visit https: www.health-ni.gov.uk topics doh-statistics-and-research health-survey-northern-ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"pintdrinking pet spotted at belfast pub lapped up by online fans","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Cllr Seamus ODomhnaill, who led the delegation along with Cllr John Boyle Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, believes that these types of engagements are essentialwe are to raise the profile of the region as an investment location. “Having these key influencers and potential investors in a room focusing on the northwest region and sharing with them our vision and ambition as well as the practical supports and assistance available to businesses in the region is vital,” he stressed. “There is no better way to build meaningful connections and relationships than face to face engagements.”Mayor John Boyle believes that: “The strength of the region is underpinned by the strong collaborative approach which sees industry, government at both central and local level, and further and higher education institutions from both sides of the border working together to fuel further economic growth and prosperity. This is something that investors value greatly in terms of facilitating ease of access to supports in the region.” Local businesses from a range of sectors across both Council areas also participated in the mission meeting with potential clients and business partners with a view to increasing sales and expanding their businesses. Derry based Bridie Mullin Irish Linen Ltd. participated in the mission and brought her eponymous label of handcrafted quality Irish line to Boston in an effort to tap into the US market.Bridie explains that the trade visit was an opportunity to build on her own research, and to visit stores and meet with potential clients gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly the customer is looking for. It also allowed her to get an insight into the potential costs associated with exporting and logistics assisting in finalising price points for trading.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe trade and investment mission also involved engagement with educational institutions with a memorandum of understanding being signed by the North West Regional College and Philadelphia Community College and the State of Pennsylvania during the mission that sees the consolidation of relationships developed over the last two years.Samantha Traynor, Vice Principal of the North West Regional College, who also participated in the Trade and Investment Mission, explained: “The MoU represents the first step in building and consolidating a partnership through education and training with a specic focus on sharing best practice in Work Based Learning to include Traineeships, Apprenticeships including Higher Level Apprenticeships and also the continued professional development of our respective professionals in our workforce.”The week also saw the announcement by both Councils of an exciting research project with Hard Graduate School of Design, exploring how the cross-border northwest city region can be shaped in light of the economic, political and social realities of Brexit. This project is being led by Assistant Professor Gareth Doherty in Hard GSD, who is originally from Donegal. Reaching out to the diaspora was also a key objective of the mission and this manested in events in both Philadelphia and Boston, where members of the diaspora from across the region attended and shared with the delegation the opportunities and challenges faced by the diaspora and their commitment to continue to engage in a way that is meaningful and mutually beneficial. The Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council also had the honour of accepting on behalf of Donegal Hospice a cheque of , raised by the Donegal community in Philadelphia.Speaking after the trip, Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, Seamus Neely, said: “This Trade and Investment Mission is part of the ongoing positive work being done by both Councils. We are committed to continuing with the positive work we are doing to drive forward our economy and to maximise the opportunities we have as a cross border gateway to both the UK and EU markets. “We have longstanding connections with Philadelphia and Massachusetts and these connections transcend economic, cultural and political linkages. The Golden Bridges conference has provided the Northwest region with an important  in the Massachusetts region allowing us to reach out, connect with and form meaningful relationships and collaborations with stakeholders in ious sectors that have been instrumental in progressing growth and prosperity in the region.”Reflecting on the visit, Chief Executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council, John Kelpie, said: “It takes time to make connections, develop relationships and build trust. Our ongoing positive engagement with Massachusetts has to date resulted in a number of exciting developments including the investment and success stories around One Source Virtual and Metaverse. “Results such as these are part of our key objectives in terms of strengthening the profile of the City Region as outlined in our Strategic Growth Plan and are evidence that our direct approach of travelling to the US, making those connections and building rapport, really works.”Pictured at the launch of the new research project led by Hard GSD exploring how the northwest region can be shaped post brexit are Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council Cllr.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and donrsquot have to climb up to get them.Cararsquos infectious personality shone through in the programme as did her determinism to try out everything despite her stature.Her love of sweets are shown in the denrsquos decor which has Gummy Bear windows, a roof made of strawberry laces, a Coca-Cola-shaped door, a lolly-pop-themed dance floor so Cara can show off her moves and several sweet dispensers that are positioned at reaching height for her.One of the highlights is a height-adjustable desk that Cara can change to suit as she gets older.Cara lives with her mum Trish, a P teacher at Cedar Tree Integrated School in Crossgar, dad Sean and two year-old brother Noah.She shares the same condition with her mum and Noah.Mrs Mailey is delighted that Cara has this special space to play in.ldquoI had never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday. They were the nicest team and Cara was their number one priority throughout it all.ldquoAppearing in this programme has given Cara a lot of confidence.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

European Union#s top official under pressure from Tory Brexiteers to secure further concessions.The Prime Minister will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks ahead of the special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.Theresa MayShe is under pressure to make changes to the Northern Irish backstop contained in the Brexit orce agreement, making it clear how the UK can exit the controversial arrangement.The trip to Brussels, and another potentially tricky session of Prime Minister’s Questions, come amid mounting evidence of tensions between Mrs May and the Democratic Unionist Party over the Brexit deal.The Government caved in to a series of opposition amendments to its Budget-enacting Finance Bill in the latest sign that the DUP’s MPs would not support Mrs May’s minority administration.Mrs May’s talks with Mr Juncker follow confirmation from Number  that the Government will look at potential technological solutions to keep the Irish border open.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman confirmed that references in last week’s draft agreement to “alternative arrangements” for the border could involve technical measures of the kind previously promoted as the “maximum facilitation” solution, or Max Fac.Brexiteer ministers want her to press for clarity on how the UK can avoid or end the use of the backstop, which would require the whole UK to be in a single customs territory with the EU and force Northern Ireland to align with many of Brussels’ single market rules after  unless an alternative is found.A Brexit-backing minister said that the negotiation process was “not over until it’s over” and it was now a case of “who blinks first” as Brussels did not want either the backstop to be implemented or the prospect of the UK crashing out without a deal.Brussels has indicated that the withdrawal agreement, setting out the terms of the UK’s orce from the bloc, will not be rewritten - although work is ongoing to flesh out the political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship.Ireland’s deputy premier Simon Coveney told parliament in Dublin: “This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiations teams, it has been agreed by the British government.“So to that extent, it is not a draft text, it’s now the text, and it is not going to be reopened.”The Brexit deal has angered the DUP and jeopardised the confidence and supply deal which props up Mrs May’s minority government.Brexit: Government forced to accept Budget changes amid DUP tensions Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"After a DUP revolt in the Commons on Monday, the Government accepted a series of amendments on Tuesday without votes to avoid a repeat.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds: “We have kept to our word in relation to the confidence and supply agreement, but even Cabinet members have found themselves having to resign because this deal does not represent those shared objectives in relation to the Union.“The Government will require DUP support to deliver its domestic agenda. We will continue to use our influence for the good of everyone across the United Kingdom.”Leading Tory Brexiteer Boris Johnson - a prominent critic of Mrs May’s approach - is expected to address the DUP’s conference at the weekend.In a sign that the Government is seeking to keep its arrangement with the DUP alive, Chancellor Philip Hammond is also expected to attend the gathering in Belfast, according to Co Fermanagh newspaper the Impartial Reporter.But Labour claimed the DUP’s approach meant the Government was on the brink of collapse.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “It’s absolutely staggering that the Government has accepted all Labour amendments to the Finance Bill because it couldn’t rely upon the DUP’s support.“The Tories are in office but not in power. We’re watching a government falling apart in front of us.”The DUP may have given the Prime Minister a political headache, but she appears to have averted an immediate challenge to her position from Tory critics.The attempt to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership spearheaded by Jacob Rees-Mogg has so far failed to win enough support to force a showdown.Last week, senior figures from the pro-Brexit European Research Groupof Tories were confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Mrs May’s leadership.But ERG chairman Mr Rees-Mogg acknowledged they were struggling to get the support they needed and warned Tory MPs that unless they acted now, Mrs May would lead the party into the next general election despite a lack of enthusiasm for that prospect within the Conservative ranks.“You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised,” he said.try catch     .               ..

Our new security provider, Wilson James, took over this contact on  November and have an ongoing recruitment drive with  vacancies currently available at enhanced rates of pay. “We are working hard behind the scenes to try to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but the recruitment, training and security clearance of staff will take time to implement. “We would ask all our passengers to arrive two hours before their flight and fully prepared for the security search process as this will speed up processing times for everyone.”A spokesperson for Wilson James said: “Wilson James took over the security contract at Belfast International Airport on  November .“Wilson James inherited a staffing shortage from the previous provider which has continued to impact the service delivery. However, we are pleased to confirm that the recruitment process for  employees is already under way and candidates are moving through a rigorous security vetting process to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained.“To complement our recruitment strategy, we are also pleased to confirm that last week we agreed an improved pay deal which will raise pay rates across the whole the security contract. “We are confident that this priority on our employees will deliver a higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport.

ICTS said it had provided an “excellent service” and claimed the inadequate service provided to customers over the summer months was beyond its control.Meanwhile, George Best Belfast City Airport, which has officially opened upgraded terminal facilities following a £ million infrastructure investment, says its new security search area has reduced average queuing times to just six minutes.• See Morning View in tomorrow’s News Lettertry catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.
