On the evening of 9 September, 400 people will gather outside the doors of Waterstones’ Piccadilly store in London for the midnight release of the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, her dystopian novel-turned-feminist touchstone-turned-meme-machine.Fans, invited to dress up in the regulation ankle-length cloaks and bonnets worn by the handmaids in Atwood’s fundamentalist republic of Gilead, will snake round the block waiting for what Waterstones is calling a “one-night festival” of, immersive theatre, political speeches and themed cocktails. At 8.15pm doors will open to a four-storey Gileadean Glastonbury, featuring guest appearances from actor Romola Garai, activist Caroline Criado-Perez, Guilty Feminist podcaster Deborah Frances-White, plus a discussion of Atwood’s legacy with authors Jeanette Winterson, Elif Shafak, Neil Gaiman and AM Homes.It’s an inventive, slightly surreal programme of events that – like Atwood – is a bit political, a bit geeky, a bit cerebral and unapologetically big on silly hats. It’s the ultimate hashtaggable celebration of a novelist who in the sixth decade of her career, having written more than 50 books of fiction, poetry and criticism, has mastered both Twitter (1.9 million followers) and Instagram (82,300). You know a writer has become a global phenomenon when the support act for their launch event includes two rivals for this year’s Booker prize. Winterson and Shafak’s novels were both longlisted, along with The Testaments, back in July.At 11pm on the night of the launch, the tiny, sprite-like 79-year-old Canadian author will emerge to read the first extracts of a 432-page book that has been kept under the tightest of wraps. Only her closest associates have glimpsed the manuscript – apart from the Booker judges, who have described it as a “terrifying and exhilarating” follow-up to her 1985 novel. Publisher Liz Calder, who was one of Atwood’s longest-standing editors, is on this year’s judging panel. While she’s not allowed to reveal anything about the book’s content, she will say: “It represents not the work of a writer who might be at the end of her career but it’s like her peak, it’s amazing in that sense.”All we know is that The Testaments is set 15 years after the final scene in the first book, in which narrator Offred is hauled into a van by heavies, who might be from the resistance or the regime that extinguished so many of the human freedoms we take for granted. When Atwood leaves the stage at midnight, fans will finally lay their hands on a book many have waited 34 years to read.Atwood’s books have sold millions. She has won the Booker, for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and had five other novels shortlisted. She has yet to be given the Nobel prize for literature but that is widely seen as an error to be righted. When an embarrassed Kazuo Ishiguro was honoured with the award in 2017, he apologised to the Canadian writer: “I always thought it would be Margaret Atwood very soon and I still think that, I still hope that.”While she has been prolific throughout her career, there is little doubt that the Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale has helped make Atwood a superstar. It has connected the novelist to a vast new audience fascinated by her vivid nightmare of an America in ecological meltdown and a totalitarian regime that is systematically stripping women of hard-won rights, leaving many as little more than walking wombs. The timing has been crucial. Since the election of President Trump, the novel’s depiction of misogyny and witch-hunts feel chillingly prophetic and the red-cloaked handmaids have become an international symbol of women’s resistance.But even before these developments, the novel had become a modern classic, translated into more than 40 languages, studied in schools and adapted into a film, an opera, a ballet and a graphic novel. “I’m a serious writer,” Atwood once said. “I never expected to become a popular one.”“She couldn’t have seen that The Handmaid’s Tale would do what it did,” Winterson says. “She’s just got on with her work right from the beginning and allowed all this success to happen. But The Testaments has come at the right moment for her as well as us because she’s now a real sage.”Sage she may be but this level of ceremony, cosplay and cult worship – involving no fewer than 120 Waterstones branches – is usually reserved for long-dead authors or Harry Potter. Certainly, the craft sessions and costume competitions celebrating her new novel seem a little kitsch, especially for a writer who delivers such apocalyptic prophecies about environmental havoc, predatory capitalism and overnight assaults on human rights. However, Atwood wouldn’t necessarily see the contradiction:“She always takes herself seriously, but she has a great respect for play and inventiveness,” says her British agent, Karolina Sutton. She recalls an occasion three years ago when she accompanied Atwood to the basement of a King’s Cross pub for the Kitschies, awards that celebrate speculative fiction. The prize was a knitted octopus tentacle, so Atwood insisted they wear homemade orange molluscs on their heads. “That’s what’s unusual about her, to have someone so intellectual who is so playful.”Still, when you’re reading about totalitarianism in The Handmaid’s Tale or man-eating mutants in the Oryx and Crake trilogy or child sexbots in her 2015 novel, The Heart Goes Last, you may relish her wit and verve, but you never lose the eerie feeling that each feature of her dystopias might soon materialise in our own society – if they haven’t already. In recent years, Atwood has been hailed a prophet for creating stories about climate disaster, lab-manufactured meat, the western fertility crisis and human organs grown inside pigs, as well as societies increasingly ruled by misogynistic strongmen, years before they were on most people’s radar.“She’s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later,” says Carmen Callil, founder of Virago Press, the publisher of books by women, who back in the mid-1970s was the first to bring Atwood’s work to a UK readership. When she first met the author over a lunch at Mon Plaisir in Covent Garden, she says she found her so “ferociously clever” that she “exploded my mind”.Atwood is a writer with many gears she can turn out transfixing character studies of Victorian women, poetry about sex between snails, essays on the history of debt and apocalyptic stories about bioengineering. Many novelists only dare to write about technology once it enters the mainstream, but she is interested in it from its inception – and rarely does it feel heavy-handed because it’s never been a chore for her to explore science in her fiction. It’s a quick hop from organ harvesting to sexual intimacy to high farce.Callil says: “There is this tradition of women’s writing that uses irony and lightness of touch to deliver monstrous concepts and beliefs. It’s that ironic voice that has helped her seamlessly move from one generation of reader to the next. That is the test of a great writer.”The Handmaid’s Tale remains Atwood’s most protean novel, with so much to say about how quickly and easily democracy can be dismantled. It remains one of the finest novels ever written on the relationship between sex, power and the social position of women. The novelist Valerie Martin, who was the first person to read it in manuscript, predicted a hit: “I told her: ‘You’re going to be very rich,’” Martin says. “Usually you read speculative fiction and squirm when sex comes up but she really gets how dangerous it is.”Lennie Goodings, publisher of Virago Press, who has known Atwood since the late 1970s, agrees. “I love the sexual politics of her books. She gets sex and I think it’s because she understands power. She’s not a moralising writer but she’s a great observer and very honest. When you read her, you feel enlarged as a human being.”Many novelists have written warnings about a future that come to seem eerily prescient. But Atwood is rare in that she has been around long enough to see systems come and go, witness various waves of feminism – and the reactions against them – and managed to respond in a second book. Such longevity, and depth of experience, is a surely a new experience for a writer.Born in 1939, a few months after the outbreak of the second world war, Atwood spent much of her early years in the wilds of Canada, where her father, Carl, an entomologist, was studying leaf-eating insects. Her childhood was unusual. Her mother, also called Margaret, was a dietician who liked being in the wilds so she didn’t have to do housework. There was no mains electricity and few roads. Atwood – known as Peggy to her family and close friends – and her older brother, Harold (her sister, Ruth, was born later, in 1951), were schooled at home with textbooks that their mother obtained. If they worked through enough pages, they were left to their own devices.This isolated childhood in the wilderness made Atwood fearless and pragmatic. Martin describes how when the family were staying on an island, the writer and her brother “dug a hole for an outhouse and nobody told them to stop so they dug this really, really deep hole. It’s still there, I believe, one of the wonders of the family. She knows how to get along without anything and if you have that knowledge, it makes you not care so much about unimportant things.”By then, she had married the writer Jim Polk, a relationship that ended in orce in 1973. Shortly after, she became involved with novelist and ecological campaigner Graeme Gibson. The couple, who live in Toronto, have been devoted to each other ever since and have one daughter, Jess, born in 1976 and now an art historian who lives in Brooklyn with Atwood’s grandson.Gibson has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and also suffers problems with his legs – but friends say he still travels with Atwood. The couple are used to an itinerant lifestyle, often spending several months a year in Norwich (where Atwood writes in local bookshop cafes). Earlier this year, they went on a boat around Australia and New Zealand. However, Gibson’s health may mean Atwood has to reduce the amount of travel she undertakes. “She’s being very brave about it and so is their daughter, Jess,” Martin says. “They’re going to figure out how to deal with it as they go along.”One senses Atwood wants to seize every opportunity for fun. She delights in playing the mischievous granny, dispensing eldritch predictions. During a recent appearance at the Moon festival in Greenwich – one of many eccentric grassroots events she supports – she stood in front of a packed-out theatre and sang the opening of Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana before performing bird calls. Bets are on as to whether she will break into song or cast a spell when she appears at the National Theatre, the night after the midnight launch, to discuss The Testaments for the first time.At the event, which will be livestreamed to more than 1,500 cinemas worldwide, BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed will chair a Q\u0026ampA session with fans who have tweeted their questions to #askatwood, and actors (including Lily James) will read extracts from the book. Tickets sold out in a day, though 500 UK cinemas will be screening the event, which the organisers claim is comparable to the popularity of a Marvel movie. Atwood may be two months shy of her 80th birthday, but her star is still on the rise, a regular fixture at red-carpet events and in women’s fashion magazines.Martin believes that now that The Handmaid’s Tale has entered popular mythology. “In some ways, the book has been spun away from her,” she says. “Perhaps what’s happening with this new novel is that she’s pulling it back in.”I ask how much control Atwood likes to have. “A lot…” Martin replies, drily, “although not consciously at all. It’s necessary to control things in her world. She pays attention and is very good at understanding market forces and what people respond to.”Such is the iron-clad security around the sequel that predicting its content is a little like writing a horoscope. Atwood has dropped a few breadcrumbs here and there. “Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book,” she has said. “Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”“That’s part of what The Handmaid’s Tale is about,” Winterson says. “How would we respond to the issue? And we probably will respond in a totalitarian way. When the first big smash hits the west, I’m sure martial law will be introduced. Given that the west has moved so sharply to the right, I can’t imagine it won’t be an excuse for those powers to shut down all the things that have worried them so far. Just as it is at the beginning of The Handmaid’s Tale, when none of the women can get money out of their bank accounts any more.”Novelist Naomi Alderman echoes the point. Atwood mentored Alderman for a year while she developed the concept for her bestselling novel The Power, a sci-fi story about what happens when teenage girls discover they have the power to electrocute others. The part of The Handmaid’s Tale that still unnerves her most is when women are robbed of their financial independence: “How simply it happens, how easily, how convincingly. Just cut off all women’s credit cards and bank cards. Just declare it illegal to employ a woman,” says Alderman. “It’s something that could happen to all of us, without any new technology needing to be invented. All it would take would be a bad government, a war, a stolen election. That possibility is never going away.”Nevertheless, when it comes to the current gender wars, Atwood refuses to stick to a feminist script. She has faced a backlash for calling for due process for a University of British Columbia professor who was accused of sexual misconduct last year. But she has always expressed ambivalence about the feminist tag.Goodings says there is nothing “sloppy” or “sentimental” about her view of women: “She is so much about equality but one thing she always says is that if women are going to be equal to men, we must also see that they do bad things too. There was a school of feminism that felt sisterhood was everything and that if women ruled the world, it would be entirely different, but she doesn’t have much truck with that. She’s pro-women but she doesn’t want to whitewash the truth.”Martin says Atwood isn’t necessarily comfortable with the idea of being a famous feminist. “It’s sad how some people absorb what they find in her work on such a banal level,” she says. “People who dress in costumes and go stand around the street is sad to me. When she talks about power, she’s careful to make clear that the women are in power as well and what we’re talking about is human tendencies, not just male and female tendencies. But obviously the condition of women historically is of interest to her.”Winterson believes Atwood is a “proper feminist” because she has helped champion so many other women – but can understand why she has resisted the term. “It’s the fear of being labelled, just as she resisted the science-fiction label and wanted to call it ‘speculative fiction’. Labels are annoying and usually they are limiting. I used to hate being called a gay writer because I knew damn well it was about patronising men trying to limit the scope of the work.”“No one will influence her choices,” says Karolina Sutton. “She doesn’t chase trends, she’s not interested in following success. If there’s something that interests her about humanity she will write about it.” Sutton, an agent with many big-name authors on her roster, says she has never met anyone as “superhuman” as Atwood. “She’s ahead of everyone in the room… she doesn’t make mistakes. She’ll be asked to write a 3,000-word piece about a subject that’s just thrown at her – on plastics or the Russian revolution. If there’s a phone at hand, she will do it.”Friends say she can be very tough. “I’ve seen her make strong women quail,” says Calder. But they all speak of her generosity. “She’s big-hearted,” Winterson says, “and the older I get, the more important I think that is, to be big-hearted towards life and not worry too much about your own position within it.” Atwood also likes a prank. Alderman says that the day after they first met, she tricked her into thinking she could speak Anglo-Saxon. “It seemed believable! Who was I to say? She got a good laugh out of that one.”Atwood is reportedly in good health and has always been disciplined about her diet. Martin jokes that she is so productive – baking pies, hosting large dinners, knitting sweaters, signing books and lending support to charities and community campaigns – that she must have a secret double chained to a desk in a windowless room in Saskatchewan, maniacally typing her manuscripts. “I’ve spent a lot of time with her, days on end, and I never see her write!” Martin laughs. “I don’t get when she does it! I think she’s made out of space-age plastic or something.”Calder, who was Atwood’s UK editor in the 1980s and 90s, notes that she constantly renews her working methods. She was the first person to use the story-sharing website Wattpad she even invented, with her stepson, a remote book-signing device called the LongPen that allows her to sign books for fans all over the world. Calder also describes how one year, Atwood decided to overhaul the process by which her books were edited, having grown fed up with responding to different editors around the world: she called a summit. “We all trooped to Toronto where she presented us each with the new manuscript which was beautifully tied up with a blue bow. We read solidly for two days without consultation and we didn’t discuss it until we had to put our suggestions to her – it was immensely practical.”The “summits” continue to this day, and often conclude with a snowy walk to her house for supper. In January, a smaller group flew to Toronto, where it was minus 20C, to discuss The Testaments. Sutton says: “It’s an editorial process like no other and she makes it very special for everyone. There’s always more theatre, it’s more creative. But no one can dictate to Margaret Atwood! She will say: ‘Well, everyone wants it to be a different book but it is my book and it is what it is.’”Atwood might joke that “all the books are compensation for being short” but she’s rarely self-deprecating. Goodings says she’s not embarrassed by her power. “She wields it cleverly, I think.

The novel was notable for its relentless nastiness: at its heart is a horrific act of teenage violence (which the meal has been convened to discuss), and the adults are all equally ghastly. This grimness may be the best explanation for its success: there was a sense that Koch was holding up a mirror to bourgeois life, and revealing – none too subtly – the darkness at its heart.Koch’s latest novel is set in a broadly similar milieu. Narrator Robert Walter is the mayor of Amsterdam (one of the diners in The Dinner was a famous politician). Everything about his life seems correct, well-ordered: he is contentedly married, with a delightful teenage daughter, and his professional life involves plenty of hobnobbing with the rich and famous (Bill Clinton, he reports, is a “turbo-charged version of myself”). Aside from an intense aversion to wind turbines, Robert appears to have few convictions or principles: his skill lies in that old politicians’ trick – telling people what they want to hear. Yet while he is cynical, you can’t help warming to him – and he’s certainly more sympathetic than any of the characters in The Dinner.Yet, inevitably, a serpent steals into paradise. At the city’s new year bash, Robert spots his wife, Sylvia, chatting with an unprepossessing alderman. The alderman says something that makes Sylvia laugh and, for a split-second, his hand rests on her elbow. This is the only prompt that Robert’s imagination needs: he is instantly cast into a world of suspicion. Are Sylvia and the alderman having an affair? On the surface, it seems unlikely, but soon Robert is devoting every waking moment to mentally pursuing this possibility.As an exploration of pathological jealousy, The Ditch is largely convincing. Koch is especially good at inhabiting Robert’s looking-glass world, in which every little thing becomes grounds for suspicion. On a weekend break to Paris, Sylvia affectionately teases her husband. “Would she still tease me (and smile and wink),” he asks, “if she were having an affair with Maarten van Hoogstraten?” But then a darker thought intrudes: is her friendliness merely a “five-star performance”, put on for the express purposes of allaying his suspicion? At a certain point, jealousy becomes almost indistinguishable from comedy in the lengths to which it goes to distort reality.The focus on Robert’s jealousy, however, proves short-lived. Other plotlines come to the fore: the imminent deaths of Robert’s ageing parents a possible scandal from his past. His jealousy, it becomes clear, had a defensive function: it was a means to distract him from more pressing (and real) concerns. Yet this realisation doesn’t particularly help the novel. The various strands never fully cohere, and in an apparent effort to make them do so, Koch makes his characters do implausible things. Nothing in the book’s latter stages proves as compelling as the paranoia it initially explored. The Ditch, you can’t help feeling, would have been more successful had it cleaved more tightly to its opening theme.• The Ditch by Herman Koch (translated by Sam Garrett) is published by Picador (£14.99).

This is a smash-and-grab raid on our democracy, to force through no deal, which is opposed by a majority of the public.Most people in Britain reject a Tory no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson’s government wants to use no deal to create an offshore tax haven for the super-rich and sign a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump.No deal would destroy jobs, push up food prices and hand our public services and protections over to US corporations. And most of the public want nothing to do with this Trump-deal car-crash Brexit they are being driven towards.Johnson and fellow Conservatives who campaigned for Leave in 2016 promised people that they would get a deal. In 2017, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, proclaimed: “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a deal.”But clearly they haven’t got a deal. And now, running scared of being held to account for his reckless plans for a Trump-deal Brexit, Johnson has decided to shut down parliament to stop them doing so.But you don’t have to go back to 2017 to find our new prime minister flip-flopping and U-turning to suit whatever position he has adopted at the time.In late July he promised EU citizens he would legislate to protect their rights. Now we learn the home secretary will end freedom of movement on 1 November without any new immigration rules or protections in its place. Clearly, this is not a prime minister people can trust.Last week the Advertising Standards Agency banned a Home Office ad about EU citizens registering to stay because it was misleading. And the government registration app won’t be ready until the end of the year (months after the home secretary plans to scrap their rights).As the Spectator – the magazine Johnson once edited – warns: “There are worrying signs of sloppiness, even negligence, in the way the Home Office is handling all this.”We already know the kind of consequences such decisions can have. The hurt caused to the Windrush generation by the government’s hostile environment policy is now in danger of being repeated on an even bigger scale, with around 3 million EU citizens living in the UK.Every week I meet EU citizens who are stressed about their future in this country. Sadly, many are leaving – taking with them their skills and support from our NHS, social care and schools.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, let the cat out of the bag when he told his French counterpart that parliament is being suspended because “we’ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority”.There is an obvious and practical solution when a government finds itself without a majority. It is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election.This week could be the last chance to stop Johnson’s Tory government taking us over a no-deal cliff edge that will threaten jobs and our NHS, mean a restoration of the border in Ireland – threatening peace – and cause shortages of food and medical supplies from day one.Industry after industry is warning of the deeply damaging impact of a no-deal Brexit. During the summer I listened to the fears of farmers, car workers, NHS staff and many others across the country.And as Trump’s close ally, the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, lets the Amazon rainforest burn, it could not be clearer that we need to build stronger relations with other international allies in the global fight against the climate emergency.The threat of a no-deal crash is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. But I am determined to ensure Labour brings people together by giving hope and confidence that a different future is possible, and real change can be delivered for every community, nation and region of our country.There is a rapidly growing movement of people determined to stop no deal. Last week spontaneous protests sprung up around the country.People are angry that those who claimed we would “take back control” are now keeping control for themselves – with the aim of handing it over to Donald Trump and US corporate giants in a race-to-the-bottom free market trade deal.This weekend, Labour MPs have been joining more protests across the country. People are determined that they will not allow a phoney populist cabal in Downing Street, in hock to the vested interests of the richest, to deny them their democratic voice.It is the people, not an unelected prime minister, who should determine our country’s future.A general election is the democratic way forward. And in that election Labour will give the people the chance to take back control and have the final say in a public vote, with credible options for both sides, including the option to Remain.In the maelstrom of the coming days and weeks, we need to remember that sovereignty doesn’t rest in Downing Street, or even in parliament, but with the people.Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea755fc8a15216f44237a1e1e275bd825c54ca8/0_48_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec3e835b9b24b22f384a52d0f16a79b","title":"life game of chance draw lots jobs","story":"The sweaty palms, the swotting, the tricky question that prompts your heart to plummet: job interviews are no one’s idea of a good time. The other side of the equation is hardly fun either: days out of a busy schedule spent interviewing candidates, some of whom you know within a couple of minutes you would never offer a job.Interviews are time-consuming for all involved. But we persist in doing them because recruitment decisions are some of the most important we take in the workplace and it follows we should invest time and energy into a robust recruitment process, right?Experimental studies show how unreliable interviewers are at accurately predicting someone’s capabilities. This is borne out on the rare occasions it gets tested in the real world. In the late 1970s, there was a doctor shortage in Texas and politicians instructed the state medical school to increase its admissions, after it had already selected 150 applicants after interview. So it took another 50 candidates who had reached the interview stage and been rejected, even though many of the stronger rejected candidates had already been snapped up by other medical schools. Researchers found these 50 students performed just as well as the original crop. Once the candidates got through the on-paper sift, they might as well have been drawn out of a hat.Not only are interviews a generally bad way to spot talent, they are terrible at smuggling in bias. There are the obvious implicit biases – sexism, racism, ageism, class discrimination – but others also exist. According to psychologist Ron Friedman, we tend to perceive good-looking people to be more competent, tall candidates as having greater leadership potential and deep-voiced candidates as more trustworthy. Interviews also encourage us to pick people who look like us, think similarly to us and with whom we strike up an easy rapport. The myth of the meritocratic interview allows all sorts of prejudice to flourish.These days, huge effort goes into trying to unpick these biases in interviews. Vast sums are spent on unconscious bias training, but the evidence as to its effectiveness is mixed at best. It turns out training a person’s subconscious to think differently isn’t as easy as a half-day course.This is why it is no substitute for breaking down the structures that allow these biases to fester. For example, managers might only be allowed to make an appointment once they have a sufficiently erse shortlist. I’ve long been a believer in quotas for underrepresented groups where improving ersity is happening at a glacial pace, for example, in Oxbridge admissions.But a recent conversation with a friend who works at Nesta, a charitable foundation, got me thinking about whether we should ditch the pretence that we can accurately predict people’s potential. Her organisation is experimenting with a lottery to award funding to staff for innovative projects. Employees can put forward their own proposal. All of those that meet a minimum set of criteria go into a draw, with a number selected for funding at random.My initial thought was that this sounded bonkers. But ponder it more and the logic is sound. Not only does it eliminate human bias, it encourages creativity and avoids groupthink, discouraging staff from self-censoring because they think their idea is one management simply wouldn’t go for. It chimes with those who have argued that at least some science funding should be awarded by lottery, because in the contemporary world of peer review and scoring grids, risky ideas with potentially huge pay-offs do not attract sufficient funding.Random selection embodies a very different conception of fairness to meritocracy. But if we accept that what we call meritocracy is predominantly a way for advantage to self-replicate, why not at least experiment with lotteries instead? Big graduate recruiters or Oxbridge courses could set “on paper” entry criteria, select candidates who meet them at random and test whether there are any differences with candidates selected by interview.I am willing to bet that, as observed in Texas, they would do no worse. And that there would be other benefits: ersity of thought as well as ersity of demography. Quotas are often criticised for their potential to undermine those iniduals who benefit from positive discrimination everyone knows they are there not purely on merit, or so the argument goes. An element of random selection might engender a bit more humility on the part of white, middle-class men it goes alongside being honest that meritocracy is a convenient mask for privilege.The reason such experiments remain unlikely is that studies show that even when people are aware of the fallibility of interviews, they sustain incredible self-belief in their ability to buck the trend. Not only that, there are a lot of powerful people with a stake in maintaining the illusion of meritocracy. Oxford and Cambridge want to preserve the misconception that their selection procedures embody the creme de la creme of today selecting the creme de la creme of tomorrow.But if you find yourself balking at random selection, ask yourself this: have you ever formed a first impression that was wrong? It might go against the grain, but making more liberal use of lotteries might produce not just a fairer but a better and more erse world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae2380a87a7ab01c2d1765f6f44fc372462084e8/0_185_2343_1405/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd739d90681464c4a13bc0b15a515ab","title":"stop whining empty nesters child going to uni not about you","story":"Why are parents hijacking their kids’ experiences to put themselves at the centre? It’s not healthyAs a fresh contingent of British kids gears up for university, who should we be most concerned for – them or their parents? I ask because sending a child off to university seems to have morphed from an exciting rite of passage (for the child) into some dark, angst-ridden melodrama starring the parents. How do they feel about it? Are their hearts broken? Will they cope?This is usually accompanied by emotional accounts of parents staring forlornly into their child’s empty bedroom, perhaps weeping on to a favourite toy from childhood, or bravely talking about taking up new challenges to “fill the void”. What emerges is a sense almost of competitive empty nest syndrome. “I’m sad about my child leaving for university.” “I’m even sadder.” “I’m practically suicidal.” And on it goes. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the most bereft of us all?It’s not all parents and in any case people are entitled to be emotional about their children leaving home. It’s a huge deal. But whose huge deal? Parents should be careful that this doesn’t turn into an unseemly hijacking of a moment that by rights belongs to the child. You hear about parents sobbing as they drop kids off – not exactly a positive start to the university experience. Other parents rather overdo helping children “settle in”, practically getting in professional decorators for their dorm-rooms, embarking on huge food shops (guilty, I did this), taking them out for lunch, then dinner… How to put this politely – parents, eff off. The time when new students arrive is hugely important – for them to mingle with their peers, not sit in Wagamama with you.A university professor has commented on “needy” British students demanding feedback and pleading “special circumstances”, much more than the Mexican students he’s also taught. Some of this might relate to the exorbitant cost of university these days, but perhaps “needy” student culture extends to hyper-needy parents too, with Mum and Dad emerging as the true, perma-melting snowflakes.For some years now, there’s been a strange generational blurring, where kids can’t even go to rock festivals without their parents shouting “cooee!” from the next yurt. It’s usually nice, parents being friends with their kids, but, occasionally, things whiff more than a little of parental narcissism, where everything that happens to their child becomes more about them, and how they’re feeling about it.Parents must resist inserting themselves into the central narrative of their child’s every experience – accept that parental marginalisation, even outright irrelevance, at the university stage is not only inevitable, but it’s healthy and crucial for the child’s independence. The good news is that, if your child is going off to university, or to do anything else positive, you did it, you launched them, miraculously everything is going to plan. Time to send up a quiet hallelujah to the parenting gods and toast yourselves with a celebratory glass of wine.And if you miss them, don’t fret – they’ll soon be ringing home for money.Cadbury has produced the first “woke’ chocolate bar. The Unity Bar features different colours of chocolate – from dark to blended to milk to white. It was released on India’s independence day, with the tagline: “Because sweet things happen when we unite.”I’ve yet to taste the Unity Bar, but here’s hoping that earnest misplaced liberalism is as delicious as it sounds. There have already been witty Martin Luther King parodies on Twitter: “I have a dream that my children will be judged not by the colour of their chocolate, but by the content of their creamy filling.”Clearly, Cadbury meant no offence – quite the opposite – but it’s still a little disturbing to see skin colours represented across the choccy spectrum. Is the blended one supposed to be mixed race? Did they actually go there – and with chocolate? Indeed, so many questions... Is Cadbury aware of the ongoing segregation problems in parts of India or of the oppression in Kashmir? Does Cadbury truly believe that confectionary activism is the future for racial harmony? Did no one in-house balk at the production stage of the wrapper, which appears to comprise illustrations of light and dark-skinned Indians?An important lesson has been learned: while, for some, chocolate is the answer to myriad woes, it probably isn’t going to solve racism.Roman Polanski is at it again. In press notes for his new film, An Officer and a Spy, when it was shown at the Venice film festival, Polanski, 86, appeared to agree with the interviewer, the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, that he was nothing less than a victim of “neo-feminist McCarthyism” – dismissing allegations of underage sexual abuse made against by him by several women.“Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing of the case,” said Polanski of his 1977 conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. I’d say it was common knowledge that he drugged and sodomised 13-year-old Samantha Gailey in a whirlpool bath at Jack Nicholson’s house. And that he scarpered from the US to avoid serving his rightful jail time. It’s also well known how feted he has since been, including that rapturous applause when he won the best director Oscar for 2002’s The Pianist (Polanski has since been expelled from the Motion Picture Academy).As much as anyone could get away with a serious sexual crime, Polanski has. Yet still he seems to view himself as a victim of a global hounding by a society that simply doesn’t understand the creative soul. In truth, he is a convicted child rapist who evaded full justice, and that’s why he can’t return to the US.It ill behoves either him or Bruckner to try to frame this as evidence of a vindictive philistine world. It remains a stain on those who still work with him, the standard, rather grotty argument being that a genius film director is different to a regular child rapist. With all that’s passed in recent years, it says it all that he doesn’t even bother to fake penitence. It’s still all about him and how maligned he’s been. His genius seems to be one thing, his self-awareness quite another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17317bc121791e9f875968656d03cc2545e32880/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23869e4240d0a1f8b871cf612a026aa5","title":"observer guide autumn culture books art films tv theatre classical music dance","story":"Long-awaited albums, audacious political theatre and TV fit to follow Game of Thrones, plus film, dance, classical and more… our critics preview the new seasonYou know Oscar season is approaching when the weather gets chillier and the options at the cinema get a little more literary – and so autumn duly brings two star-laden adaptations of major modern American novels.First comes The Goldfinch on 27 September: Donna Tartt’s epic Pulitzer prize-winner sprawls in a way some pundits thought more suited to a TV miniseries, but building on the Oscar-nominated success of Brooklyn, director John Crowley is tackling it for the big screen, with Ansel Elgort heading the cast as semi-orphaned wanderer Theo Decker, and Nicole Kidman ideally cast as Mrs Barbour.On 30 November, Jonathan Lethem’s celebrated detective odyssey Motherless Brooklyn hits cinemas courtesy of director and star Edward Norton – venturing behind the camera for the first time in 19 years.Both are challenging projects: will they do their source material justice? Meanwhile, you have some catch-up time if you haven’t read either novel – otherwise how can you say “the book was better” with any kind of airy authority? Guy LodgeAny UK tour by Ariana Grande will always be emotional. Fresh off a run of August London dates and a special performance in Manchester for Pride, the singer now takes her huge album of last year, Sweetener, around the rest of the UK she’s recently added a further two London dates at the end of October.Our own Charli XCX, meanwhile, wondered whether she would ever release another album proper. But after five years of innovative mixtapes and arresting standalone singles comes a full-on studio effort – Charli – on 13 September, studded with guests as erse as Christine and the Queens, bedroom pop auteur Clairo and self-styled queen of New Orleans “bounce”, Big Freedia.Charli’s former tour mate, candid US singer Halsey, has hinted – in a mocked-up mugshot in the video for her track Nightmare in May – at an October release date for her own “loud” third album, widely expected to be called Manic. Halsey has described the writing process as one of “learning to forgive myself”. Kitty EmpireSince Game of Thrones slayed the world – let’s forget that damp squib of a final series – the fantasy genre is back in televisual vogue. Screenwriters have been raiding the bookshelves for similar sagas to adapt and the first wave of Westeros-influenced series arrive this autumn.Most promising, though, is the BBC and HBO’s ambitious adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy. With a cast led by James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and, of course, an armoured CGI polar bear, confidence in its success is so high that a second series is already commissioned. George RR who? Michael HoganAfter her triumphs with Enron and The Effect, dramatist Lucy Prebble turns her unswerving gaze on the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Based on the book by the ’s Moscow correspondent Luke Harding, A Very Expensive Poison considers how in 2006 the Russian spy, MI6 informant and Putin critic died of radiation poisoning after drinking a cup of green tea in a central London hotel. The play is at the Old Vic until 5 October: John Crowley directs Tom Brooke and MyAnna Buring play the Litvinenkos, Reece Shearsmith is Putin. Susannah ClappKen Loach brings the same scalding anger to the gig economy in Sorry We Missed You as he did to the benefits system with I, Daniel Blake. And, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the films also share the same location. This portrait of a family strained to breaking point by a treadmill of hard graft and mounting debt is superbly acted and unwavering in its focus. The deliberate pacing and edgy, restless camera give the story a cruel momentum and sense of the walls closing in on a hapless delivery driver who just wants to do well by his kids.

From 21 November to 8 March. Laura CummingWe are quite possibly in UK rap’s golden age, and autumn’s live shows epitomise that. Two of this year’s Mercury prize nominees, the powerful Little Simz and raucous Slowthai, are both touring the country, as is one of Afroswing’s finest, MoStack, riding high off his debut LP. Ladbroke Grove star AJ Tracey will be playing Ally Pally, while Charlie Sloth’s infamous Fire in the Booth show will be getting a September live edition with a first-time festival in Sheffield (with the somewhat dubious title of Fire in the Park), featuring the likes of Giggs and Yxng Bane. Grime don Skepta is heading up a phenomenal Warehouse Project line-up in November (rising stars Octavian and Flohio are among others playing that day). Finally, the release of Kano’s Class of Deja has arguably been the biggest grime moment of the year (second only to Stormzy at Glastonbury) – accordingly, Kano’s tour this October is a must, culminating in a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Tara JoshiBen Lerner’s third novel, The Topeka School (3 October), is an education in the sympathetic imagination, a deep and bracing intellectual challenge, a powerful political statement. As usual, Lerner plays winningly in the fertile ground between fiction and memoir, as usual he is often hilarious and occasionally infuriating. Wider-reaching, subtler and kinder than his earlier works, this is a novel to cherish.We return to Gilead in another Booker-longlisted novel, Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments (10 September) which carries powerful messages for the #MeToo generation. It’s striking that this novel is published just before another highly anticipated book, She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Both should be required reading.Zadie Smith’s short stories are predictably luminous, insightful and full of glorious prose. It’s hard to believe that Grand Union (3 October) is her first collection, drawing as it does on more than a decade of writing for the New Yorker. She’s already one of our best novelists and essayists this reminds us that her short stories are right up there too.Jonathan Safran Foer is always fascinating on the subject of vegetarianism – his Eating Animals persuaded me to (almost) give up meat. We Are the Weather (10 October) shows the clear link between industrialised animal farming and climate breakdown in a book of scintillating relevance and authority.In these times of political turbulence and an increasingly rabid and scrofulous commentariat, the sanity, wisdom and clarity of Rebecca Solnit’s writing is a forceful corrective. Whose Story Is This? (5 September) is a scorchingly intelligent collection about the struggle to control narratives in the internet age. Alex PrestonTwo of the UK’s most accomplished satirists, Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, both launch films this autumn. But the pair, who previously collaborated on the TV series The Day Today, take markedly erging approaches with their respective projects. Morris, who skewered Islamist terrorism in Four Lions, turns his focus on the US law enforcement agencies that manufacture threats in order to justify department funding. The anger in The Day Shall Come is to be expected the stab of poignancy comes as a surprise. Iannucci, meanwhile, has left his habitual political arena (Veep, In the Loop, The Death of Stalin) and adapted Dickens’s David Copperfield. The Personal History of David Copperfield stars Dev Patel in the title role and opens the London film festival. WIMargate expanded as a centre for art with the opening of the Carl Freedman Gallery in the old Thanet Press building, next to Tracey Emin’s studio, in May. Its second exhibition, Gossamer, curated by Zoe Budeaux, brings together 22 artists – including Uday, Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas – who work with tights or stockings, and will open on 28 September. Also from 28 September, actor and art collector Russell Tovey curates Margate NOW, a town-wide festival of music, art and drama, including events in unexpected places from the railway station to the shore. And all of this accompanies the opening of the Turner prize show at Turner Margate (28 September) with one of the strongest shortlists in many years, bringing together Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo. LCAnticipation around Martin Scorsese’s plan to dramatise the real-life story of mob hitman Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, who was involved in the notorious disappearance of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975, has been cranking up for years. Now it’s finally hitting cinemas on 8 November, with Robert De Niro as Sheeran and Al Pacino as Hoffa – but with only a brief window before it streams on Netflix on 27 November. This is familiar ground for Scorsese but the pedigree is high: Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List) wrote the script and Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin co-star. Killian FoxBritish ballet promises some intriguing major debuts by dancers. The Royal Ballet’s Marcelino Sambé marks his recent promotion to principal dancer by reprising his raffish Lescaut for Kenneth MacMillan’s Manon, opening at Covent Garden in October, before taking a lead role as Franz in Coppélia on 28 December. Expect buoyant technique and giddy charisma from this young ace.Northern Ballet’s Antoinette Brooks-Daw is moving into the company’s top rank following rich turns in Cathy Marston’s Jane Eyre and Victoria. Catch her displaying her narrative chops in Morgann Runacre-Temple’s Kingdom of Back – part of a new mixed bill along with David Nixon’s Dracula (Leeds, Doncaster and Canterbury, SeptemberOctober).And then there’s former Washington Ballet star Brooklyn Mack who joins English National Ballet as a guest artist. Fresh from a well-received stint at American Ballet Theatre, he has roles in Christopher Wheeldon’s Cinderella (Manchester, Southampton, October) and Anna‑Marie Holmes’s Le Corsaire (Milton Keynes, November). Sara VealeTwo starkly different views of the capital arrive on the streaming service this autumn. In a period of flux for the real royal family, it seems timely for sumptuous biopic The Crown to return with a fresh cast. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as the Queen, with Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip and, deliciously, Helen Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. Covering the period from 1964 to 1976, it glides majestically on to Netflix on 17 November.The other comeback is more surprising but entirely welcome. Top Boy, writer Ronan Bennett’s down-and-dirty thriller about Hackney drug gangs, was bafflingly axed by Channel 4 six years ago. Now it’s been revived on Netflix with the backing of Canadian superstar Drake. The reboot, which drops on 13 September, sees Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane “Kano” Robinson) return from exile to reclaim their territory, only to find an ambitious new generation are now running things. Rappers Little Simz and Dave join the cast, alongside exciting new discovery Micheal Ward. (See feature on page 20.) MHAway from the superhero glut of summer, autumn has become the new season for more grown-up sci-fi escapism: recently Interstellar, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 all opted for the cooler months. The biggest-budget project yet from American auteur James Gray (revered in France, underrated everywhere else), Ad Astra stars Brad Pitt as an astronaut venturing deep into the solar system in search of his father it premieres in competition at the Venice film festival and opens shortly after, on 18 September.Unpredictable as ever, two-time Oscar-winner Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi) returns with Gemini Man (in cinemas 11 October), a high-concept, hi-tech thriller with Will Smith as a hitman pursuing his younger self – it sounds a bit derivative of Rian Johnson’s Looper, but in Lee we trust.If Hollywood fantasy doesn’t do it for you, seek out Aniara (out now, reviewed page 32), a fascinating, meditative Swedish mission to Mars. In this version of space, no one can hear you scream, but at least you can hear yourself think. GLA decade on since landfill indie seemed to consign guitar music to the dustbin of history, a new wave of innovative, boundary-pushing releases is on its way to expand the genre’s horizons. Erstwhile Sexwitch vocalist Bat for Lashes embraces a dreamy 80s vibe on her forthcoming album Lost Girls (AWAL, 6 September): saxophone solos, arpeggiated synths and lyrics about female vampire biker gangs feature.Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard releases her debut solo album, Jaime (Columbia, 20 September). Dedicated to her sister, who died of cancer when they were teens, it has a tender, expansive sound, encompassing soulful ruminations on love, spirituality, and growing up as a mixed-race child in the deep south.Angel Olsen follows up 2016’s excellent My Woman with the magisterial yet delicate All Mirrors (Jagjaguwar, 4 October), preceded by a mesmerising new single of the same name with a cinematic black-and-white video.Finally, Michael Kiwanuka’s meditative, assured third album Kiwanuka (Polydor, 25 October) s psych-gospel, politics and self-acceptance, as well as nodding to his Ugandan heritage. Kathryn BromwichTate Britain is gathering new momentum this year, after the success of Van Gogh and Britain and Mike Nelson’s elegiac Duveen Commission. Huge crowds are anticipated for its autumn exhibitions. These include William Blake, from 11 September, which doesn’t focus on one particular area so much as the all-embracing originality of his vision, entering his mind through the works, and recreating the tiny room where they were made. Two Turner prizewinners follow: Mark Leckey (from 24 September) builds a life-size replica of a motorway bridge on the Wirral, where he grew up, as the scene for new video and audio works. And Steve McQueen brings his mass portrait of 70,000 primary school children to the museum: the nation’s future, from 12 November. LCWritten for the Venice carnival season, Handel’s early-career gem Agrippina, about one woman’s lust for power, and rivalry in love, is staged for the Royal Opera House by the director of the moment, Barrie Kosky, with a glittering lineup led by American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, British countertenor Iestyn Davies and British soprano Lucy Crowe. Packed with explosive music and showpiece arias, this is a story for our times, of leadership and failed diplomacy. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and cast are conducted by the Handel specialist and harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev. Fiona MaddocksNot one, not two, but four short new works by our greatest living dramatist have landed, fully formed, in the Royal Court’s lap, and are being staged in one quadruple bill. Which is basically Christmas come early for theatre fans. As usual with the publicity-averse Churchill, there’s not much known about them yet, but Glass is reportedly about a girl made of glass, Kill deals with gods and murderers, Bluebeard tackles a serial killer’s friends, and Imp concerns a secret in a bottle. James Macdonald, with whom Churchill worked on Escaped Alone, directs the lot for a limited three-week run (18 September to 12 October). Holly WilliamsOn his 2017 album Peasant, Richard Dawson harked back to early medieval England to chronicle a nation at war with itself. No need for distant historical allegories on his latest record 2020 (Weird World, 11 October), which is less a snapshot of contemporary Britain than a full-scale narrative immersion. The Newcastle folk-rocker, whose interests extend to Sufi devotional music and beyond, tells first-person stories of ordinary Englanders trapped in an increasingly cruel system, which sucks their souls dry for profit. Listening to civil servants unravelling at the thought of depriving yet another poor soul of their disability living allowance may sound like hard going, but 2020 is funny, freaky and unexpectedly melodic as well as desperately moving – you won’t hear a better song about the hell of working in Amazon-style distribution warehouses than Dawson’s 10-minute Fulfilment Centre. KFIt’s farewell to Sarah Frankcom, who’s been a brilliant head of the Manchester Royal Exchange – but she should go out with a bang with Light Falls (from 24 October). A new play by Simon Stephens is always an event, but even more exciting is the man doing the music: one Jarvis Cocker. Light Falls connects five relatives living in cities across the north, and looks at how they’re drawn together after a devastating event. More cheerful, perhaps, will be The Boy in the Dress – the RSC’s new musical version of David Walliams’s children’s book, with songs by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The story of Dennis, a 12-year-old who likes football and dresses, is adapted by Mark Ravenhill, and opens 8 November. HWENO’s ambitious season explores the Orpheus myth – the grief-stricken hero tries to rescue his lover from the Underworld – with four operas from the 18th century to the present. Directed by the choreographer Wayne McGregor in his ENO directorial debut, Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice stars Alice Coote and Sarah Tynan Harry Bicket conducts. Offenbach’s comic Orpheus in the Underworld is one long, naughty, can-can dancing party. Ed Lyon and Mary Bevan head the cast. Sian Edwards conducts, Emma Rice directs. The unmissable rarities are Harrison Birtwistle’s ritualistic masterpiece The Mask of Orpheus, director Daniel Kramer, conductor Martyn Brabbins and Philip Glass’s Orphée, inspired by Cocteau director Netia Jones, conductor Geoffrey Paterson. Discounts if you book the series. FMYou might think we’ve no shortage of Ibsen – but two new productions look to be bold, essential reimaginings. Hedda Tesman is by Cordelia Lynn (whose Three Sisters has recently been at the Almeida), and promises to breathe new life into Ibsen’s classic, Hedda Gabler, for touring company Headlong. Haydn Gwynne stars in the title role (Chichester Festival theatre, 30 August-28 September the Lowry, Salford 3-19 October). A new version of A Doll’s House, written by Tanika Gupta – who moves the action to Calcutta and invites us to look at the play’s gender politics through the lens of British colonialism – opens at the Lyric Hammersmith on 6 September. It’s the first production by the west London theatre’s new artistic director, Rachel O’Riordan, and stars the captivating Anjana Vasan. HWGentlemen, start your engines because Mama Ru is strutting, sashaying and shantaying our way. After becoming a global phenomenon over the past decade, the long-awaited UK edition of RuPaul’s Drag Race launches on BBC Three in October, with 10 home-grown acts competing to be crowned “the Queen of Great Britain”. Guest judges include Graham Norton, Maisie Williams, Cheryl, Alan Carr, Stacey Dooley, Andrew Garfield, Michaela Coel, Lorraine Kelly and Twiggy, alongside stalwart Michelle Visage. Self-empowering positivity and upbeat bubblegum camp have rarely been more needed. They better werk. MHLondon’s annual Open House weekend (21-22 September) always delivers an embarrassment of architectural riches, providing free access to more than 800 buildings usually off limits to the public, accompanied by a programme of tours and talks. Where else can you take in Lambeth Palace and the Marx Memorial Library in a single weekend? Marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which made “housing for all” a government policy, some of London’s key postwar housing schemes will also open their doors for the first time. They include Alexandra Road in Camden, the Golden Lane Estate and Ernö Goldfinger’s twin monuments to brutalism, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower. Other London landmarks, such as the BT Tower and 10 Downing Street, will be available to visit by online ballot. Catherine SlessorBranden Jacob-Jenkins – who has had hits here with An Octoroon and Gloria – brings his 2014 play Appropriate to the Donmar until 5 October (see review, page 40). The Lafayette family return to their late father’s house, a former plantation in Arkansas – and this, being a Jacob-Jenkins play, is a slanted, subversive take on the classic American family drama. It’s directed by Ola Ince (The Convert), and stars Monica Dolan.There’s more family feuding in Fairview – which won Jackie Sibblies Drury this year’s Pulitzer prize for drama, and which promises to rip the genre to shreds. At London’s Young Vic from 28 November, directed by Nadia Latif, this race drama should provoke, unsettle and dazzle audiences here too. Annie Baker is back at the National Theatre – which staged her hugely acclaimed plays John and The Flick – with The Antipodes, in which people sit around a table, telling, examining, and categorising stories. Intriguingly, Baker herself co-directs with Chloe Lamford, who is also designing the show (21 October-23 November).

Kirsty Powell, a mother of four who recently set up a Facebook school uniform donation group in Stratford-upon-Avon, said academies were increasingly trying to copy the uniforms of private schools with expensive blazers and heavily branded PE kits. “If you send your child to a private school, you might expect to pay those costs. But these are state schools,” she said.Powell’s group, which she runs with two other volunteers, collects uniform donations for 31 local schools and has received more than 200 requests since mid-July alone.Jane Malcolm, CEO of Level Trust, a charity in Luton for local children living in poverty, said she had seen similar problems with a shift to branded uniform – “which means you can only get it from certain expensive suppliers”. Malcolm started collecting school uniform donations two years ago, and said requests from parents had doubled over the past year. She had even started a “naughty list” of state schools that had changed their affordable school uniform to one that could easily cost £250 per child, not including shoes or coats, she said.Campaigners are critical of the government’s failure to act on a 2015 promise to make it a legal requirement for schools to make value for money the main consideration when setting uniform policies. Mark Russell, chief executive of the Children’s Society, said it was “shameful”.“This simple change would prevent thousands of parents having to cut back on essentials or get into debt just to buy their children’s school uniforms,” he added.In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, families can apply for statutory support with the cost of school uniforms but in England it is up to inidual councils and schools to decide whether to make help available. An annual survey of school governors and trustees, to be published next week by the National Governance Association, is expected to show a drop in the number of schools offering families assistance with the purchase of uniforms.“Given that two-thirds of governors say that their school does not have enough funding to support pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, we believe that the reduction in support for purchasing uniforms is largely a result of the severe funding constraints that schools are currently facing,” said Emma Knights, the NGA’s chief executive.Joyce Tetteh, one of the parents being helped by School-Home Support this year, said she had had sleepless nights after calculating she would need to spend £465 on school uniforms by September. Tetteh, who lives in east London on benefits of £245 a week, has four school-age children. “I took medication to cope,” she said, adding that she had been about to cut back on food before the charity’s “life-saving” intervention. “I was really worried,” she said. “I thought I had no options.”Freema Chambers, a mother of three who set up the Facebook group Community School Clothing Scheme two years ago after running out of money to buy her son school trousers, said she had seen requests from parents “at least double, maybe triple” over the past 12 months. The scheme had handed out more than 4,000 items of school uniform, worth about £40,000 to local families, in Sunderland and the north-east since schools closed in July, she said.“Parents come to us distressed,” she said. “Schools are insisting that, for example, you buy trousers with the school logo on, which are nearly double the price of normal school trousers.” Vulnerable families are faced with terrible choices as a result: “It’s awful knowing that, if I can’t help a parent get hold of a particular item of school uniform, they are going to have to go without fuel or food in order to buy it.”Kate France, founder of the Uniform Exchange charity in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, said she had also seen requests double over the past year. More than 800 families have received uniform donations through the scheme this year.Another charity, Bromley Brighter Beginnings in south London, works with medical professionals, teachers and social workers to provide families with items they need. Its founder, Emma Martin, said she had received so many referrals requesting school uniforms for children this year that the charity had launched a campaign to attract more donations. “More people are struggling financially now, because of austerity. But when a child moves schools – which a lot of deprived families do regularly because it’s not up to them where they get housed – they’re expected to have a particular branded uniform.”Martin said uniforms in her area could cost as much as £400. “It’s expensive and unnecessary. I don’t think there’s any need for schools to put that much pressure on families.”Last November, Kristina Murphy, a mother of two, started collecting donations of school uniform for local families in Birmingham via her Facebook group Rubery Schools Community Swop Shop. After sitting on exclusion panels as a school governor she had noticed that, often, a pupil’s spiralling bad behaviour was triggered by reprimands for not wearing the right uniform or having their PE kit.“It made me reflect: what if you don’t have those items and you’re coming to school anxious you’re going to get into trouble? That could make a vulnerable child quite aggressive and emotive.” These children may then act as if they don’t care about the uniform as a defence mechanism, so that no one will find out their parents cannot afford it, she said. “They’re embarrassed.”Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “The prime minister has been clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools to level up education funding across the country. No school uniform should be so expensive as to leave pupils or their families feeling unable to apply to or attend a school of their choice.“Our guidance is clear: schools should prioritise cost when setting uniform policies, including making sure uniforms are available at different outlets, and keeping compulsory branded items to a minimum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce563cdcf76ac7ad15b06e83bb0649c34fc6d46/0_103_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c918c4f1610585cb01d9647142215b7c","title":"outstanding schools to lose ofsted exemption","story":"Outstanding schools will no longer be exempt from routine Ofsted inspections, education secretary Gavin Williamson has announced. The move is one of several government measures intended to bolster education standards.The new, expanded inspection programme aims to ensure that parents get up-to-date information and can be confident that schools rated outstanding continue to provide the highest standards, said Williamson. “Every parent wants to know their child is getting a great education and I will leave no stone unturned in my drive to deliver that,” he said.Since 2012, once rated outstanding, schools have been exempt from routine inspections to free them from external intervention. But many schools need up-to-date comparative performance information and parents deserve greater assurance that the education provided remains of the highest quality, Williamson has decided. His department will consult on how best to do this, subject to parliamentary approval, and bring these schools back into a regular inspection cycle.A new specialist academy trust will also be set up to take on schools struggling with long-term under-performance. The scheme is to be piloted in northern England.Sunday’s announcement comes days after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged a £14bn boost for education and outlined ambitions to close the gap in standards across the country. The funding package includes £2.6bn for 2020-21, £4.8bn for 2021-22, and £7.1bn for 2022-23.

It was an unusual sight. Salmon are rarely found in the Afan these days.The scene may have been unexpected, but it nevertheless illustrates a growing problem, say researchers – one that already affects rivers across Europe and could pose even greater threats to habitats and wildlife in future. Increasing numbers of dams, weirs, sluices and other barriers built in rivers over the past 200 years are, they say, fragmenting waterways, isolating habitats and weakening wildlife populations.The salmon on the Afan provides a good example, according to Peter Jones, a postdoctoral researcher at Swansea University. “It was lying on gravel in front of a weir. It would have been trying to get upriver, and although there are fish steps at the side of the weir it would still have had its progress slowed, and been left vulnerable to predators such as otters. The gulls are probably just having an opportunistic snack.”Jones is a member of a Swansea-led project called Amber (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers), which aims to find ways to halt the fragmentation of European rivers and the dangerous isolation of their habitats. “Flowing rivers are healthy rivers – and by flowing we don’t mean just water, we mean sediment, energy, nutrients and organisms,” said the project leader, Professor Carlos Garcia de Leaniz.The trouble is that very few rivers today have flowing, healthy waters. Apart from abstraction by water companies and farmers, which lowers river levels, more and more barriers are being revealed by the Amber project, which is funded by the EU.“In Europe we have detected 460,000 barriers, and by the end of the year we estimate that we’ll have 600,000,” said de Leaniz, director of Swansea’s Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Research. These dams and weirs pepper Europe’s rivers and prevent migratory fish from swimming upstream to reach their spawning grounds in river headwaters. They also stop vital nutrients flowing downstream to the sea, to the detriment of coastal marine ecosystems.Amber is intended to provide a European overview of the problem. In addition, a second, very detailed survey – called Reconnecting Our River – has been established to study the nearby River Afan. The lessons learned here could be applied to other UK rivers.“Technically the Afan is considered a free-flowing river because there are no big dams on it,” said Josh Jones, another researcher with the Swansea team. “In fact, our work shows there are about 600 barriers inside its catchment area, including weirs, culverts, pipes, channels and sluices.“In many cases, no one can remember why these were built. But each one contributes in some way to the fragmenting of the river environment.”It is also thought that the dams, weirs and culverts built on the Afan over the centuries may be playing a part in slowing its restoration as a salmon and trout river.In the 19th century coalmine waste and other industrial pollutants killed most fish in the Afan it was not until the middle of the 20th century that its waters were cleaned and restored.However, salmon and trout have been slow to return and the researchers point to the hundreds of barriers that have been placed across the Afan and may well be delaying the restoration of fish stocks in the river.Scientists also warn that, as the climate crisis increases its grip on the planet, river fragmentation will become an even greater problem. Pools of still water created by dams and barriers will become vulnerable to rising temperatures, for example. “That risks triggering major changes in wildlife,” added Richard O’Rorke, another Swansea researcher.The crucial point is that river barriers will need to be removed – which is likely to be costly. A major aim of Amber, and also of the Reconnecting Our River project, is to highlight ways of alleviating problems of river flow without spending vast sums.“It may be that, instead of knocking down a large dam to improve water quality in a river, we can interfere with smaller structures and make less expensive changes that will still bring significant improvements,” said O’Rorke. “That is a specific goal of this research.”All major rivers in Europe are now disconnected from the sea, and this has had a catastrophic impact on many species, according to campaigning organisation Amber.• Salmon and eel have become extinct or are threatened with extinction in many UK rivers, and the presence of dams and weirs is partly to blame.• In the Netherlands and Germany, barriers along the River Rhine prevent the migration of sturgeon and shad.• In Spain and Portugal, salmon have disappeared from all but a handful of rivers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d550b94d1f5eadb98a689e2b27c6912c5ccfc26/0_181_4960_2975/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=759b70986dc2d99ee57c6040eeddf2aa","title":"worcester led lighting help bats cross road","story":"Bats in Worcester are to get their own red-light area.

Standard street lights also attract insects that bats feed on, reducing the supply available in their feeding areas.The red-light scheme – believed to be a first for UK bats – will be installed to overcome these problems but also ensures the safety of all road users, said Ken Pollock, a local councillor. “These lights are a great example where we have been able to adapt the usual standards to better suit the local environment. The adapted lighting may look a little different at first, but we’d like to assure those using the area at night that the colour of the lights has been through stringent testing and adheres to all safety checks.”Visibility for drivers and pedestrians is not affected by the red light and the scheme is fully compliant with the required standards, the council added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

He’s excited about the new collection. The first pieces went into John Lewis’s White City store that morning and he is visibly chuffed. He’s already wearing the trouser samples, which will go on sale in November, and it looks like he’ll be living in them for a while. He’s his own best customer. “I personally like a dishevelled, worn garment,” he says. “I like that patina things take on when they look well-worn.”The tagline for the collection made exclusively for sale in John Lewis and Folk, is “Wear it out”. “It’s not fast fashion,” he says. “It’s important that people wear the garments out.” Folk already repairs clothes that are returned if they have been damaged. “If they can be repaired or upcycled, then the team will make sure that happens,” he says. The same will be true for It’s All Good Folk. “If something needs a minor repair we will replace the garment, if need be, then we can repair it and resell it, or we can make a charitable donation so it can be used and worn again.”Making clothes last longer is important, but it is only part of the story. Fashion has become an industry that even the people who work in it feel increasingly uneasy about. Designers and supply-chain managers like those in McAteer’s team are all too aware of news about microplastic-contaminated rain in remote parts of the world, about fashion brands burning clothes they can’t sell, and the unfathomable amounts of waste and pollution created by the production of fashion and textiles.McAteer’s team are keen to drive change within the business. When John Lewis approached Folk to collaborate on a menswear line, it made sense to do things a little differently and rethink the way the collection is sourced and made. He employed the services of sustainability consultant Dan Holmes. “We have been studying how we can make our supply chain, suppliers and ourselves do things better,” said McAteer. The result has motivated the team and re-energised the whole business.A lot of it made both common and business sense, like making sure factories were close to fabric suppliers so they were no longer shipping a material from, say, Japan to Poland, to cut down on air miles. “It’s always a balance,” says Holmes. “Is a recycled fibre better than organic? Is organic better than BCI – which is Better Cotton Initiative? It’s all about trade-offs. Is the focus on ocean plastic or climate change?” These are the questions all brands – big or small – should be asking. But there are no easy answers or quick fixes. “There are definitely people doing it much better,” says McAteer. This is a starting point. The whole team is really excited about the fabrics we’ve chosen to use, from BCI cottons to the organic cottons, recycled nylons, polyesters. It is definitely positive and we are pretty happy.”Rethinking materials and sourcing is all very well, but it still doesn’t address the issue that we are fundamentally making too many clothes. That’s why McAteer is so determined to communicate the “wear it out” message to ensure that nothing ends up being worn a few times before ending up in landfill.He shows me the video he made to promote the new collection and its underlying message. It was filmed in Glasgow, inspired by the early days of Folk, when he and a couple of friends would go on a road trip and take pictures. It perfectly encapsulates the Folk spirit – utilitarian clothes to have a good time in. It’s the details that are all important: the seams designed to flatter the lines of the body, the subtle logo printed on the side of a jacket, the fit that allows you to move.Cathal McAteer grew up in Cumbernauld, outside Glasgow, in the 1980s, with little interest in school and an obsession with clothes and design. He got himself a milk round at 12 so that he could save up money to buy cool stuff he was into, and, by the time he was 16, he was working in Glasgow’s cult designer boutique, Ichi Ni San.In 1990, Glasgow was the City of Culture (the Independent dubbed it “City of Couture”) and was enjoying its moment in the style spotlight with a thriving music and fashion scene. McAteer was at its epicentre, modelling for the store and soon travelling to the shows in London and Paris, in search of new collections to sell. Already, he was dreaming of his own shop and label.He moved to London in the late 1990s and, after a few years working for brands including Nicole Farhi, he was convinced there was a niche for a new label for people like him and his friends. In 2001, Folk was born. The name was suggested by a friend – the perfect unassuming tag for a quietly cool Modern British brand that was to gain a following of people in the know, tuned into the worlds of music, art and design, as well as the finer details of utility tailoring.Eighteen years on, Folk has grown a loyal and dedicated following. Womenswear was introduced in 2012 along with accessories, shoes and the odd bit of furniture and a selection of other products that have caught McAteer’s eye and share his values. There are now five stores and regular collaborations with artists, designers and musicians.The collaboration with John Lewis meant McAteer had to make sure his manufacturers were signed up to the partnership’s Responsible Sourcing Code of Practice that sets out expectations on pay, working hours, child labour, worker rights and the right to freedom of association as well as responsible sourcing of materials, with factories being audited by third-party companies. It meant asking some of his suppliers who weren’t already on the list to sign up, which he says is due diligence and good for them, too.While you could argue that if Folk is serious about reducing its impact, it wouldn’t be expanding with a new collection in 12 John Lewis stores, but fashion is a business and McAteer wants to grow in a measured way. The irony is, the brand now has a greater access to more sustainably sourced materials which were previously too expensive for him to buy in smaller quantities.McAteer doesn’t believe people should pay more just because a product is made in a more sustainable way. That, surely, should be standard. Through economies of scale, It’s All Good Folk is cheaper than the main Folk line. A print shirt is £75, while a T-shirt made from Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS)-certified organic cotton is £40.As he zips up his minimalist twist on a classic MA1 jacket, which is made of recycled polyester, he talks me through the collection. All the pieces are based on archive favourites, redesigned for today – which means not just the fabrications but the styling, too. There’s a shirt that was originally made in cotton but has been reimagined in a new low impact viscose called EcoVera. The original version felt stiffer, this one has a lovely drapey feel to it.“It’s all Good Folk is designed with the Folk ethos at heart – that’s unrestrictive clothes designed beautifully with every detail marked off,” says McAteer. “And then we apply this new ethos in that we make these garments in the best possible way, with a trusted manufacturer, using fabrics that are locally sourced next to the manufacturer in great factories. And we will make those garments as clean as possible. We will be scrutinised. But let’s do the best we can… we’re asking all the questions.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Interest in an experiment once dismissed as an ill-advised splicing of incompatible media (see squirmingly camp examples such as Night Trap) has been supercharged by Bandersnatch, an interactive episode of Black Mirror broadcast at the end of last year. Erica, a lavishly produced thriller about a commune-cum-hospital for troubled teenage girls follows Charlie Brooker’s mode. You play as Erica, a nightmare-racked orphan (played engagingly by Holly Earl, best-known for her role as Agnes in the Channel 4 drama Humans) returning to the institution that defined her childhood. Founded by Erica’s father, the place is unnerving, with tropes including a syringe-wielding matron, murmuring inmates and an ominous, polite and well-dressed director. Every detail, from the ritualistic animal masks in the commune’s lobby to the motif of an ancient symbol scratched on just about every surface, from wall to skin, shrieks 1970s-style institutional abuse.The oppressive ratcheting of atmosphere is tempered by the game’s regular demands for interaction from the player. The designers urge players to use their smartphone to control the game, and with good reason: the swipes and rubs of one’s finger on glass mimics closely the action on screen as, for example, Erica cleans a brass plaque in order to read an old inscription, flicks open a Zippo lighter, or pulls a photo from a sheaf of papers. These somewhat pedestrian interactions sit alongside some stylish effects where, for example, you trail your finger back and forth over the phone screen to trigger a flashback that starts playing in the marks left by your impression. The transitions between video are ostentatiously elegant and show just how far technology has come in two decades. And yet the old questions remain over how much the interactivity and branching paths add to a story that, it seems, could have been just as well told in a traditional mode.No such criticism could be levelled at Telling Lies, a spiritual sequel to designer Sam Barlow’s award-winning 2015 game, Her Story. In Erica and Bandersnatch the player’s role is to jostle the story along by poking at the scenery and, occasionally, choosing one of a few narrative branches to follow. Telling Lies, by contrast, is a thriller built from a thousand fragments, which must be sifted and pieced together as much in the player’s mind as on the screen. You play as a woman who, via her laptop, has access to a vast archive of secretly recorded video calls pulled from the computers and mobile phones of four distinct iniduals. The clips, which last between 30 seconds and 10 minutes, are sifted by searching for keywords that appear in the footage. Type “pistol”, for example, and you’ll receive a trove of videos to view. Searching terms is a little like playing Battleship: you fire a salvo and see what strikes.As you piece together the lives of the four subjects, a digital treasure trail emerges. The results of one search term inspire you to query the database for another, following leads much like a private investigator. The result is a truly nonlinear narrative, the shape and effect of which is entirely unique to each player. The plotline builds and twists according to personal whim and interest, and much of the narrative threading is performed in the mind of the viewer, rather than in the authorial arrangement of facts. Ingenious, moody, and curiously well produced for such a constrained narrative lens, Telling Lies is a singular work, whose appeal lies as much in its format as in its presentation and performance.Control(Remedy Entertainment, 505 Games PS4, Xbox One, PC)Finnish studio Remedy has an obsession with cinematic thrillers built at the stratospheric end of the budgetary spectrum: the developer’s previous games, Quantum Break and Alan Wake were luxurious flops. A more traditional kind of video game than the current crop of interactive fiction experiments, Control casts players as Jesse Faden, director of the clandestine Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). This US government agency functions a bit like the Ministry of Magic from the Harry Potter universe, with oversight of paranormal activity.No wizardy hats and snaggled wands here, however: supernatural matters are dealt with in the traditional American way – down the barrel of service weapon (albeit one with the power to shape-shift). Faden must explore the labyrinthine skyscraper office known as “Tthe Oldest House” in search of answers, not only about the Bureau, but also the supernatural events that defined her childhood. It’s a supremely stylish game, more fluidly enjoyable than the studio’s previous efforts, but expect a multitude of exposition spectres to fight through en route to the action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24263aecbba5b479a99a188a6f7089c3a0ab749c/0_126_5455_3272/master/5455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5a3126effec42811f6bf12f76d3a9a","title":"letting it all out behind of the scenes of loose women","story":"Fast, funny and fabulously frank, Loose Women has been a daytime favourite for 20 years. Sophie Heawood on tales of Noel Gallagher’s mum, cellulite and on-air bust-upsI am sitting in the live audience at a TV studio, being taught how to feel my feelings. “What do we do when something’s funny?” the charming young man on set asks us, bursting into laughter for us to imitate. “What do we do when something’s sad or moving?” he continues, launching into a big, gooey “Awwww!” that we all repeat. “And what do we do when something’s important and needs to be said?” he adds, before clapping vigorously. Finally, after making the largely female room squeal with laughter about how he might work here but he’s only ever been with men and wouldn’t know what to do with it, love, he announces: “Think of yourselves as the fifth Loose Woman.” At which point the other four Loose Women appear to whoops and cheers, an autocue starts rolling with something for the anchor to read about learning to love your cellulite, and the live broadcast of television’s guiltiest, stealthiest pleasure begins.Two hours earlier I was in the dressing room with Coleen Nolan, Brenda Edwards, Nadia Sawalha and Andrea McLean – actually, I was in the corridor when Nadia rushed past, pointing at her face saying, “Don’t worry, it gets better,” which turned out to mean she was about to be plastered in just enough glamorous makeup and hair products to still look relatable, this being the key concept of a daytime talk show that needs viewers at home to feel these women could be their best friends. It’s a concept that clearly works, because Loose Women, with its rotating cast of female presenters who discuss funny and painful issues from their personal lives as well as debating what’s in the news, is about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. It might be a noisy show, but it has quietly become one of TV’s greatest success stories. So why, I asked them, does nobody admit to watching it?Coleen, the former Nolan sister, who has been on the programme for 18 of its 20 years, replies, while a makeup artist teases her long hair into rollers. “It’ll be a bloke who says to you, ‘Ugh, my God, Loose Women? Oh I never watch that. Never. That day when you said that thing to Nadia – I mean I just had it on ’cos the wife watches it.” Brenda Edwards, a stalwart of West End musicals after finding fame on X Factor, applies her own lipstick and agrees. “A lot of my male friends are like, ‘No, no, I’ll never watch it… but I loved that thing you said last week.’”Andrea McLean, who recently published a book about the menopause, says the weirdest is when pop stars tune in from their tour bus, at which point Coleen remembers Noel Gallagher introducing himself to her at Euston station, saying his mum bloody loved her and the show so much that she’d never forgive him for not saying hello – which sounds like a fine excuse. But it’s not just the men who are in denial, apparently.“Oh no, I had this smartly dressed woman ambush me in a toilet – you always get ambushed in toilets – to tell me she didn’t watch my dreadful programme, but that she had been surprised to discover I was actually quite good,” says Andrea, tilting her head back for her mascara to be applied. “I’d have flushed her head down the loo,” Coleen replies.In addition to the four panellists, there are celebrity guests – some of their favourites have been Whoopi Goldberg (who presents a similar American show called The View), Goldie Hawn and Eva Longoria. Nadia points out they have male guests, too. “Every so often we let a couple of them on,” she says. “We do a little Loose Men.”Do people ask that, though – where’s the panel show for loose men? And do you feel tempted to answer…“Every other fucking show,” they all reply.What I love about Loose Women is what seems to go unnoticed: its mundane presentation of completely bonkers surrealism its chatty, mainstream wails of existential angst. In 2016, Peter Andre agreed to try to find out what childbirth was like, so Loose Women dressed him up in a fatsuit to make him feel pregnant, then sent him to a medical laboratory where he was hooked up to an electrical impulse machine to induce labour pains. He writhed around in agony, begging for it to stop. In 2017, Janet Street-Porter decided to marry herself, with the footballer Frank Lampard conducting the ceremony for some reason. “Do you, Janet, take you, Janet, to be your lawfully wedded Janet?” he asked. “Yeah,” replied Janet nonchalantly, from behind a bridal veil, clutching a bouquet. “Why not?” I once told an editor from Vice, the edgy online magazine famed for its hipster antics, about these episodes, and he was wide-eyed, saying that Vice could only dream of pulling off such stunts.Last month, the panel discussed the lunar landings. It began innocuously enough: “Can you believe it’s been 50 years since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon? Although some of us don’t believe it, do we?” That day, two panellists revealed they track the International Space Station on their phones, but not Nadia, who admitted that looking into the night sky brings such a terrible awakening of her own mortality that she has to turn away – when she looks closely, she sees death. “Death?” asked the others. “Death,” confirmed Nadia, nodding sombrely.The same week, an audience member went to such lengths to hide from the cameras that she ended up with her face plastered all over the internet – which was awkward, as it transpired the woman had told her boss she was going to a funeral. Marginally less awkward was recent guest Nicola Sturgeon, who was clearly uncomfortable when asked about women in leadership and seemed keen to point out that it was a bit like men in leadership – some of them are crap. The show then revealed a photo of her aged 18, looking awful. “I should walk off the set,” the leader of the SNP muttered, taking a sip of tea from her Loose Women-branded mug. And then, “I wish this was gin.”In the dressing room, I ask Coleen why it all works. She says it’s chemistry, vulnerability, and that the women are not too well media-trained, “because that wouldn’t work – the whole thing about Loose Women, for me, is its honesty. The public are good at spotting when it’s not.”If there is one word I hear a lot behind the scenes at the show, it is “relatability” – but how does that really work, when these women have all been famous and well-paid for years? How long can you keep up the auntie-next- door act when you get invited to celebrity parties?While there are younger hosts, such as Stacey Solomon and a couple of potential new girls from Love Island, Loose Women is a rare celebration of older women, with more over-50s on it than probably any other telly programme. Today’s hosts are all middle-aged mothers, but Janet is 72, with no children, while Gloria Hunniford is nearly 80. One rule is that you have to be prepared to air your dirty laundry in public, something that partners and offspring are not always happy about. Coleen, who began on the show after her orce from Shane Richie, had to tell her second husband Ray Fensome “that it’s what I do and it’s what the show’s about, and if you can’t handle it, then off you pop. So he did.” The show has outlived many of their marriages.Two weeks after I meet them, Nadia discusses, live on air, her stormy relationship with sister Julia Sawalha (who played Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous) and Julia retaliates on Twitter, saying she is sick of Nadia “destroying our family” by discussing them on Loose Women.Brenda tells me she doesn’t like discussing politics. She did once manage to say on air that she supports bringing back the death penalty, but she got into more trouble for saying she leaves her cat alone for five days when she goes on holiday. She has trouble reining in her swearing, but always manages, “because my children are watching and it’s not right.”“She talks about her children as if they’re five and six,” Coleen interjects. Why, how old are they, Brenda? Brenda looks a bit sheepish now: “28 and 25. But I don’t swear in front of them! I always say you’ve got to lead by example.”One thing the women all agree on is that the work they do is important. They claim it is “a big deal to sit in those seats”, because they help people at home feel less alone. For example, on today’s show, they discuss the loneliness of raising a teenager, the time where, as Nadia put it, “Your child doesn’t fancy you any more,” and they get such a big response in the hour after it airs that they decide to develop the topic further tomorrow. Nadia remembers a similar response when she revealed she had put her miscarriage in the freezer.Wait, what? “Oh, they were laughing at me in the meeting room, where we discuss all the things we want to talk about, but when I had a miscarriage I didn’t know what to do with it. And loads of people have since told me that they felt really bad about it, but they secretly put theirs in the freezer, too. We get people literally sobbing with relief and gratitude that someone has said the unsayable. And that’s what you can normally count on us to do – being an older woman with life experience is a plus on this show. It’s just breaking open those subjects that people are keeping to themselves. I think that’s a really important part of what we do. We’re not TV presenters, we’re not like…” she pretends to be a purring cat and does a sexy voice, “‘Heeere I am, licking myself.’”I take their point, but a recent discussion with Carol McGiffin, who is not here today, must have stung. McGiffin is white, has repeatedly defended Donald Trump, and told fellow panellists Nadia Sawalha and Saira Khan, who are of Jordanian and Pakistani descent respectively, that the US president telling four American congresswomen of colour to “go back home” was fine. Surely they were sitting there looking at her and thinking: “You’ve never been told to go home like that, you don’t know what racism is.”Sawalha says she did talk more about that one with her husband when she got home. “It was such a strong view that she came out with. But I think the world is just so fragile at the moment, because we are all scared of our opinions. There are not many people who would sit on the television and say what Carol said in the way that she said it. So I was excited about that show.”Is that because McGiffin brought to light what a lot of people were thinking but not saying? “Yes. And if we pander to the keyboard warriors, then we’ve got a really scary world and it’s not right. You have to talk it out, you can’t keep avoiding it because you’re scared of the response.”After the episode is broadcast I go backstage and wait for the panellists to return from a meeting. It takes longer than expected, so by the time they walk in I’ve got a bit too comfortable and am peering at my bum in the mirror, trying to work out if I’ve got cellulite, after the women themselves showed their squidgy bums on the show.Nadia and Andrea walk in on me and gasp – not because my skirt is hitched up over my knickers, which seems perfectly normal round here, but because I didn’t already know if I had cellulite or not. Hadn’t I checked before? I have to confess I hadn’t, explaining that I don’t really worry about body stuff at all, but feel a bit weird admitting it. At this, Nadia grabs a passing producer in the corridor and yanks her into the room. “We could do this on the show! Sophie here is ashamed of not being ashamed! She doesn’t have any body positivity issues, but she feels she should!” It gets jotted down as a possible subject for a future show – the untapped area of women secretly feeling embarrassed about not feeling embarrassed – and I realise my work here is done: I’ve followed that nice man’s instructions and accidentally become the fifth Loose Woman.Loose Women is on weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde925a476c78f120a8abc62478de4c76a4ffe3e/0_523_7848_4709/master/7848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d03a5e36132dfcef0925695be3bf5a","title":"india almost 2m people left off assam register of citizens","story":"Rights groups warn of possible humanitarian crisis as those left off list face statelessness and detentionAlmost 2 million people in north-east India face the threat of statelessness and detention after they were excluded from an official list designed to root out illegal immigrants.Security was heightened in the border state of Assam on Saturday, as millions of people waited for the final release of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) – a major bureaucratic exercise that rights groups warn could create a humanitarian crisis.Over the past four years, about 33 million people in Assam have been forced to prove they are citizens by demonstrating they have roots in the state dating to before March 1971. An official website crashed as people across the state logged on to discover their status, while others queued in the rain at local centres.Lawyers have raised serious concerns over the process, which they say has wrongly excluded people on the basis of minor clerical errors in decades-old documents. There are fears that Muslims, women and the poorest communities could be the worst affected.Many of the people left off draft versions of the list were born in Assam and have families that have lived there for generations, according to campaigners. Saibul haq Sikdar, a teacher from Barpeta district in western Assam, read online on Saturday that his name had been rejected. He is the only person excluded in his family, who have lived in Assam for generations.“More than anger I am very sad, because being a citizen of a country and having it declared that you are a foreigner, you don’t know where you stand at this moment,” said Sikdar.The registry authorities said in a statement that the list had been “meticulously carried out in an objective and transparent manner”. About 1.9 million people were excluded.It is not clear what will happen to those who lose their appeals at foreigners tribunals, though many fear they could face detention. There are already several detention facilities in Assam’s prisons, and the state reportedly plans to build an additional 10 camps to house those declared to be migrants.Mithun Deb, from Bongaigaon, said his mother, Alorani, had been in a detention centre since 2016, when her citizenship was questioned.“When we enter the home at night it feels empty. Mother is not there. Not a single night goes when we don’t cry, me and my brother, wondering in what condition she is sleeping, or how she is staying away from us,” he told the  on Friday night. Alorani was excluded from a draft version of the NRC, even though her sisters were included.Anyone excluded from the final list has 120 days to appeal against the decision through a foreigners tribunal, but campaigners say these bodies are vulnerable to political pressures and have produced arbitrary judgments.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace, a group that is supporting affected communities, said the tribunals should be made more transparent, and that a more realistic deadline for appeals is needed.“It is a nightmare. I cannot even think of how it is going to be possible,” she said.“If the authorities are serious about a proper and fair process they should not hold the threat of a time-bound process over the heads of poor and unlettered people,” said Setalvad.The register was primarily targeted at people whom authorities describe as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, which shares a border with Assam. There is significant resentment towards immigration in the state, and there was an anti-migrant movement in the 1980s.Amnesty International said it was unrealistic to expect people from the poorest communities, who may have been internally displaced by violence or natural disasters, to preserve half a century-old records.The process is also weighed against women, campaigners said, because they often lack access to necessary documents, and because the ones they do have are incorrectly given less weight by authorities.Aakar Patel, the head of Amnesty International India, warned the state of Assam is “on the brink of a crisis which would not only lead to a loss of nationality and liberty of a large group of people but also erosion of their basic rights”.There are concerns that Muslim communities could be worst affected. Separately from the register, the governing Bharatiya Janata party is pursuing a citizenship amendment bill, which aims to give citizenship to religious group such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and others who are minorities in neighbouring countries – but not to Muslims.In its manifesto the BJP also promised to introduce NRC elsewhere in the country, though some BJP leaders in Assam have criticised the process. India’s home minister, Amit Shah, has previously promised to deport immigrants, describing them as “termites”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58cac676cd3261b7972dbe19803dfb8d0feec639/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed81e450fd8212a78e5aacded9bd6a19","title":"how to clone your own begonias","story":"Begonias are a bargain if you grow them yourselfAs regular readers will know, I have become a bit of a begonia obsessive. And with all sorts of new species being introduced from the jungles of Asia, it seems after years in the doldrums these exotic houseplants are finally experiencing a much-deserved renaissance. In fact, rarer specimens now frequently exchange hands online for almost £100, which continually surprises me considering how easy it is to clone these plants for free.While there are loads of different propagation methods for begonias, many are only suitable for very specific varieties, which can make the whole process confusing for non-geeks. However, there is one that in my experience works for any variety going and, as luck would have it, is also by far the simplest. If you fancy trying your hand at cloning your own begonias, now is a good time of year to do it and all you really need is a glass of water.Finally, sit your glass of water in a bright, well-lit spot out of direct sunlight, a place where you can comfortably read the small print of a paper without squinting from the glare of sunlight. Keep an eye on the water level to ensure this doesn’t dry out, especially given the small size of the container. Within a few weeks, most of your cuttings should be sending out roots and once these get to about 3cm long they will be ready to pot up in regular seed and cutting compost.From one smallish plant you should be able to get up to five cuttings at a time, to give you plenty to share with your friends and family. And, as all plant parents will know, there is no gift quite a wonderful as a plant you grew yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d8eb9c1d5c3a2bd71f8835ccdf52ca8b733210/661_716_6694_4017/master/6694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8cddd5752e8d3c883a6c123459070ed","title":"it draws out the optimist in me extend your summer by embracing september","story":"Full of sunlit, unhurried afternoons and opportunities to reconnect with friends, it’s time to give September the credit it deserves. Lucy Vine raises a glass to the month of neverending summerAt the risk of alienating any weather-grumps out there, I’m going to start by saying this in caps: GOD I LOVE SUMMER. I love the sun and the paddling pools and the noise from literally everyone in the world standing outside my local pub. I love people at work turning up in shorts and moaning happily about back sweat. I love constantly losing my sunglasses and looking blank when my mum tells me the names of the blooming flowers in my garden. Summer is clearly the very best of seasons. Full of joyful socialising and people actually smiling at each other.What I don’t love, however, is this thing we all seem to do whenever the end of August arrives – that oddly British tradition where we all look at each other and go: “Well then, that’s summer done for another year.”The reason this irritates me is simple: because it’s not true! The season isn’t over just because August is over. In fact – to paraphrase Frank Sinatra – the best month is yet to come. September should always, categorically, be included when we think of our summer months.September is, almost without exception, lovely. It brings its own kind of magic to the season, with glorious sunshine, but also red-golden falling leaves and long, bright, breezy days. You can still sit outside, still go barefoot in flip-flops, still enjoy a tasty early evening Grey Goose vodka cocktail. My favourite drink for those sunny September weekends was recommended to me by a bartender last year. It’s the Grey Goose le Grand Fizz – a delightful, heady mix of Grey Goose vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, fresh lime and soda water, with ice. It’s everything September-y in a glass cool, refreshing, delicious joy. And there is nothing more perfect than sitting on a roof terrace somewhere with friends, the sound of clinking ice around you.I will admit, sometimes I get accused by loved ones of being cynical. A determined pessimist, one might say. But not in September. There is something about this month that draws out the optimist in me. Something new and exciting in the air that creeps in – I am happier, more inspired, and I see it in others around me, too. People are wider-eyed, refreshed, ready to take on new projects and plan new adventures. It’s the time of year to begin again, to achieve, to try. It’s an opportunity to elevate every occasion. September is when I plan my trips, it’s when I arrange to see friends, it’s when I date. September energises me. I feel magnetic, sociable and playful in September, I feel brave and bold. It makes me restless in a good way twitchy for parties and spontaneous fun.September is a dreamy month, as well, if you prefer cosy evenings in. You’re no longer under pressure to get outside for the sake of making the most of the sun. Cardigans can make a comeback from that distant, forgotten shelf in your wardrobe. The new season of telly begins, and with it all the 60-minute dramas starring Richard Madden you can handle. Plus, after months of picking at smoothies and salads, you can eat proper meals again. Pasta! Roast dinners! Potatoes! And there’s nothing like an after-dinner cocktail in your garden of an early evening to top off your day. My favourite post-dinner drink is the Grey Goose Espresso Martini with Grey Goose vodka, a single original finest quality espresso, coffee liqueur and a pinch of salted dark chocolate powder to garnish.And so, the campaign starts here join me in giving September the credit it deserves. It’s time to stop treating the ninth month like summer’s ugly stepchild. It’s time to stop drawing the blinds down on the season before we should. It’s time to embrace our inner optimist and this wonderful, joyful, neverending summer.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffeac2e0923b2d15ea9af0b985ea4d0218ccd1c/0_0_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f69bb1d4d9c32a325322db821a8e04","title":"celebrate the day how to plan a gathering at the last minute","story":"Summer is the season for spontaneity, so why not make the most of bright days and long nights with a spur-of-the-moment do? Here’s our guide to making it a night to rememberWhen was the last time you had an impromptu get-together? There’s always a good reason not to. On Friday night, you’re tired from work. Saturday comes, and you just want to relax after a busy week. And on Sunday, well, it’s Monday tomorrow!But there are really so many reasons to organise a do at short notice, from a surprise bank holiday heatwave to keeping the holiday vibes going after you’ve returned from a sunny beach trip abroad. To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.Curate the guest listForget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don’t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you’ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they’ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen. As far as inviting colleagues goes, best to limit it to people in your after-work drinks crew.Choose a second-in-commandPerhaps the most important tip is to select a good friend to help you keep an eye on food and drink, playlist coups, general tidying and other party admin to keep your own stress levels low. They can even subtly begin the party exodus on your command, so long as they’re the sort of pal you can turn to and say: “Right, I’ve had enough, get everyone out now.” We all need a friend like that.Democratise the playlistThere’s nothing more irritating than guests commandeering the music, but once the drinks have started flowing, people will inevitably try their luck. Avoid this by inviting your guests to help with the playlist. Ask each to send a couple of suggestions when they confirm they’re coming, whack it all together on Spotify and then dilute it with your own picks – it’s your party, you deserve that.Don’t be precious over glassesYou can get those plastic throwaway champagne flutes and martini glasses nowadays, but frankly it’s a waste of money and plastic. We’re in Britain, so chances are your household will have at least 20 perfectly useable mugs of varying taste levels in your cupboards, and anyone who judges you for using these shouldn’t be on the guestlist in the first place. There’s enough plastic being dumped into the world without you adding extra because you can’t be bothered to wash up at the end of your do – and that’s what the aforementioned second-in-command is for, anyway.Encourage photography, not selfiesInstagram is a wonderful thing, but in the age of Stories, selfies and #squadlife, it’s easy to forget that photos used to be something you had to wait for. That is, you had to finish a roll of film, then go and get it developed, and all with no idea of what the results would look like. But that was part of the fun of course, and – dare I say it – encouraged people to take better, more spontaneous and authentic photos. So, rather than posing for endless posts, why not pick up four or five disposable cameras and distribute them among your friends to take pics throughout the evening? The classic Kodak single-use is still great for colour shots, or for a touch of perennial monochrome cool, try Ilford’s range of black and white disposables.Make some nibbles to rememberIt’s really easy to make simple food feel a bit fancy with just a few additions. Fill paper cups with salted popcorn mixed with spices like za’atar and sumac for a warming, Middle Eastern twist, or toss some walnut halves in a pan with soy sauce to make a crunchy salad topping brimming with umami. You can also roast broccoli with olive oil, salt, garlic, fresh chilli and lemon juice for plant-based finger food that’s surprisingly tasty – and won’t have your guests feeling lethargic a couple of hours after eating. A homemade dip is an easy way to impress too – tzatziki is a personal favourite, and I like to use Nigel Slater’s recipe, minus the dill.Don’t forget the detailsIt’s the little things that make a party flow: lime wedges stored in the fridge, waiting to be plopped into drinks wifi password shared before guests arrive extra toilet paper lots of – and I can’t stress this enough – kitchen roll and sun cream! Try and pre-empt the sorts of details guests might need during the party, and have them out, ready and signposted. If nothing else, it’ll stop them interrupting you in the middle of dancing to Beyoncé.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b79a7e2987eaafcaffc6a5d4f8cc7940d4c479/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eaf594b0978f249bbff150ec2b4ef70","title":"its about the morning afters why the joy of friendship isnt found in the big moments","story":"Great friendships aren’t forged on the big nights out, but the spontaneous moments when the phones are forgotten about, and conversation and laughter flows freely, says Lauren BravoMy best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we’ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we’re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.Increasingly I’m realising it’s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.Far and away my favourite moment of freshers’ week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose’s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They’re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now – not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone’s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.It’s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged – not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It’s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it’s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.And that’s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: “pub?”The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure – but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you’re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone’s top-line news that you’re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.So it’s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people – and the other people you connect with. Maybe it’s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (“it’s kitsch!”). Your film buff mate who will come over to watch arty foreign-language flicks with an armful of continental cheeses, knowing you’re both going to talk the whole way through, Espresso Martinis in hand. Your Eurovision crew, your board games gang, your summer solstice picnic posse. Here’s an idea: every time you say “we should do this every weekmonthyear!”, why not try … actually doing that? Leave your phone in your bag. Skip the administrative catch-up and talk about whatever crosses your mind instead. Let a nothingy Tuesday night mean as much, if not more than celebrating a birthday, an engagement or promotion – and mix up some suitably convivial cocktails to match. Blood Orange Sangrias, anyone?Don’t hang around waiting for the next Big Life Moment to get together with your friends. Because every shared evening, every new in-joke and every Seemingly Inconsequential Pow-wow (SIP?) is absolutely worth toasting, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400b8a5ad031417844dd79329f0e6d7acb2e0667/0_290_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1b96188d8eb83b91441a63c246e418","title":"cabildo review singing about the american dream behind bars","story":"Arcola, LondonAmy Beach’s 1932 opera about disaffected tourists at a New Orleans prison is given a present-day update in this impressive bootstrapping production‘Cabildo, cabildo – what does it mean?” ask the characters a minute or two into Amy Beach’s eponymous 1932 chamber opera. The artfully heaped bric-a-brac – a red life-ring, a US flag, a broken TV, a Madonna adorned with a long pearl necklace – serving as the set at the Arcola doesn’t give much away. But Grimeborn, now one of the UK’s most established fringe opera festivals, has finessed the art of producing surprises on a shoestring budget. The gnomic stage decor aside, Beach’s only opera – short but hardly ever performed – is a real discovery.Nan Bagby Stephens’s libretto is set in the present day and 1812 New Orleans. A group of disaffected tourists visit the prison in the Spanish governor’s palace (the cabildo), led by the Barker, who tells them about its most famous inmate: the “gentleman pirate” Pierre Lafitte. The tour moves on but one woman, Mary, lingers, falls asleep and dreams about Lafitte’s escape.The story-within-a-story structure isn’t subtle, but the text is a compelling mix of folksiness and melodrama. Beach’s score is a constantly shifting palette of colours, an accompanying piano trio providing real-time responses to on-stage action (think Puccini) but within a soundworld dominated by Brahms, folk music and post-Wagnerian harmony. Musical director John Warner revelled in the drama of the ferociously difficult piano part, wrestling huge, Tristan-esque climaxes from the Arcola’s upright. Hattie Haynes on violin and Saran Davies on cello provided sensitive, if sometimes understated support.Beru Tessema was compelling as the Barker (a spoken role), exhorting his group to “Read your guidebooks” with fine comic timing. Much of the singing was also excellent. Helen Stanley (Mary) and Joseph Buckmaster (Tom) were persuasive as redneck newlyweds (oversized earrings for her denim and Trump 2020 cap for him). Baritone James Quilligan clearly enjoyed himself as the intoxicated Gaoler and Alexander Gebhard’s light tenor Dominique was sweetly earnest, though Alistair Sutherland’s Pierre Lafitte often sounded forced. As Lafitte’s paramour, Lady Valerie, Alys Roberts was captivating. Her soprano was sweet and warm, relishing the length of the opera’s most grateful melodic lines – and it showcased Beach’s exceptional qualities as a song composer.• Grimeborn is at the Arcola, London, until 7 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5a3b8ed588960a0173deec5fde9da69607c437/0_184_4392_2636/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63107758f1d54ca423dd773bec8c3b08","title":"eu citizens are you experiencing settled status issues in the uk","story":"If you have encountered problems applying to the EU settlement scheme or your application has been denied, share your stories with usEU citizens living in Britain have asked the government for clarification on their status in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They all have until December 2020 at least to use that programme. Until then, nothing will change in terms of their status and rights. This is well set out.“There shouldn’t be a single person that should be concerned about their status.

And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.”Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen’s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen’s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Gove’s hints that the government may ignore legislation was a major escalation. “The Tory attack on our democracy is getting worse. Gove has just refused to confirm.. that the government will accept legislation passed by Parliament,” he tweeted.The Conservative MP Guto Bebb, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: “This government’s unprecedented willingness to flout the rules is a disgrace to our democracy.“Not only are they suspending parliament to try and force through a disastrous no deal, but now they are suggesting that, even if parliament passed a law requiring the government to avoid no deal, they might simply ignore it. Our very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government.”Bebb said Gove had admitted no deal was not what he had campaigned for in the 2016 referendum. “Now he’s willing to tear up our democratic system to force this outcome on the country, against the wishes of both parliament and the public,” he said.“The Brexiters in government like to cloak themselves in the language of democracy, but they willingly ignore basic democratic principles as and when it suits them.Gove said there would be no shortages of fresh food in the event of no deal but said food prices could potentially rise. “Everyone will have the food they need,” he said.When asked if prices would increase, Gove said: “I think that there are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.”Gove, who is chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, officially launched the Cabinet Office’s £100m Get Ready for Brexit campaign on Sunday. It will include television, radio and billboard advertising, billed as the government’s biggest ever public information campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44b02a04642a1533af5bf6a44216b95776bae7d3/0_34_5885_3530/master/5885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0720d67ea92ea55d666ad20c4764ce41","title":"britain coup parliament suspend prorogue brexit","story":"Historian and political commentatorThe British constitution is unlike any other in the world. You cannot find it in a bookshop or read it online. It has no manual or handbook. Instead, it is a delicate assemblage of laws, practices and institutions, built over centuries and held together by a fragile tissue of customs, conventions and understandings. It relies on trust and on a common commitment to its unwritten rules. That has allowed it to adapt and evolve, but leaves it dangerously vulnerable to the abuse of power.Boris Johnson’s predecessors were often careless with the constitution, but none showed such contempt for its core principles. The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy, in which “the will of the people” flows through our elected representatives. Our claim to be democratically governed rests on this slender foundation: that a government must command the confidence of the elected chamber. By wielding the royal prerogative to silence parliament, Johnson has struck at the foundations of our democracy.Johnson is perhaps the first prime minister in British history who does not recognise parliament, or a parliamentary election, as the source of his authority. He was placed in No 10 by 90,000 party activists – not much larger than a single constituency – whom he courted through his column in the Daily . He appointed Dominic Cummings to the heart of government: a man who months earlier had been found to be in contempt of parliament. Once, that would have disbarred him from office. Today, it is a programme for government.He will claim a higher mandate than parliament: “the will of the people”, expressed in the referendum. Yet it gave no instruction on the terms of Brexit, a fact Johnson exploited to vote down a previous withdrawal agreement. Once we decide that someone other than parliament should interpret the referendum – that some heroic leader knows more truly what was in the mind of voters – we are walking a very dangerous road.In the short term, prorogation may succeed. If Johnson goes for no deal, it makes it harder for MPs to stop him. If he wrings some kind of package from the EU, it may frighten some into backing it. If all else fails, it clears the way for a “people versus parliament” election.But at what cost? Like loggers torching the Brazilian rainforest, Johnson and adviser Dominic Cummings have traded short-term profit for devastating structural harm. They have set precedents that others will follow and scorched the fragile ecosystem of our democracy. “Conservatives” once saw it as their responsibility to protect the constitution. How times change.Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it’s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people.These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight!The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen’s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn’t get them through in that time, it risks losing them.The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government’s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen’s speech or defeat it. If the Queen’s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament’s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation.Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out.If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won’t do that because he knows that he doesn’t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn’t have the votes in the country to win a general election. My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple – put up, or shut up!Labour MP for Derby SouthYes. It’s clever – which is the reputation of the PM’s advisers. It’s also ruthless and improper – which is also their reputation.Supporters claim having an autumn recess or prorogation and a new Queen’s speech is “normal”. Autumn 2019 finds us on the brink of the biggest constitutional change for more than 40 years. Yet a government without a working majority, led by a PM without a public mandate, seeks the longest adjournment for 70 years. This is not “normal”.To me this is the latest, most dangerous, manifestation of a rolling coup parliamentarians have been battling since 2016. From the outset, Theresa May sought for powers to be returned to and exercised by the executive, not parliament.She had to be forced by the courts to accept that MPs should have any voice in the decision to trigger article 50. When detailed legislative changes were required, sweeping and unfettered powers for ministers were proposed. Almost every request for papers to be published or information shared was rejected and fought.The suggestion that MPs should be allowed a “meaningful” vote on her proposals was strongly resisted.The approach to government defeats in the Commons – once a matter of concern or at least embarrassment – became quite cavalier.In Opposition day debates the government stopped voting to defend their policies on any but rare occasions - usually when they thought that they might win.Concern was expressed even in the Conservative party, at this unprecedented but ingenious way of making the expressed view of the House of Commons nugatory, or meaningless, in its effect.For almost three years, government used and abused its considerable powers to control what MPs were allowed to debate and when, often hindering or even preventing the House of Commons from expressing its view on the government’s handling of Brexit.When final proposals were known, debate and decision on them was delayed, week on week, month on month, blaming those who it was feared might not support the government. Then, when the government could delay no longer and it went down to the biggest defeat in our parliamentary history on its flagship policy, even this defeat was just ignored, and the government pressed on regardless.The parliament to which we were told sovereignty was being restored has been steadily sidelined, ignored and has now been silenced.So it is a coup – but it’s just the latest step in the incremental trashing of our unwritten constitution, as longstanding conventions are disregarded and discarded. Dangerous precedents are being set.National organiser for Another Europe Is PossibleAn unelected prime minister is attempting to prevent parliament from meeting because it might disagree with him. His aim is to drive through Brexit – deal or no deal – by an arbitrary date in late October. In doing so, he hopes to solidify a huge parliamentary majority in a snap election marked by a rightwing populist campaign demonising foreigners and what he will decry as the political elite. He is, as Britain’s 20th Etonian prime minister, apparently not a member of this elite himself.The longer-term aim of Johnson’s plan goes much deeper. Brexit Britain is to be a deregulated country, brought closer into the orbit of Trump’s America. Workers’ rights, food standards and environmental protections are to be undermined. Public services and the NHS will, as made clear by the US government, be up for sale. Naturally, there is little to no public support for this agenda, and no majority for it in parliament. So Johnson does not want to allow either the public or MPs to vote on it until it is too late.Parliament has not been completely shut down. The press is still free. But not all coups come with tanks and internet shutdowns. Yes, we have our civil rights – but try telling that to the millions of migrants who face a future of uncertainty, and even deportation, if the government goes ahead with abruptly ending free movement. The executive is waging war on the legislature, and it might win if we do not mobilise to stop it.This government is not going to be persuaded by strength of argument. It must be forced to reverse course. Hopefully, the opposition parties will win this week in the Commons, but as citizens we must understand that we cannot rely on parliamentary process, or the judiciary. The little democracy we have was fought for, bled for, by mass movements which stretched the boundaries of legitimate dissent. If protest movements are not willing to disrupt, they are toothless.The suspension of parliament is not some maverick act of hubris. The shutting down of democracy, the attacks on rights, the absurd claim to represent the people while denying them agency – these are the essence of the Brexit project. Brexit is not the end – it is a tool to entrench power and privilege, to ide working people against each other, and aggrandise the sociopaths who fronted the Leave campaign and now occupy No 10. This absurd, dangerous moment is the natural conclusion of Brexit. This is its true meaning.We are witnessing the growth of a huge movement in defence of democracy. From Monday, we’ll be protesting daily at 5.30pm across the country. Join us at stopthecoup.org.uk.Director of the Constitution Unit, University College LondonBoris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament has sparked demonstrations under the banner #StopTheCoup. But is this outrage justified?Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government’s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week’s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline.No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose – and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this – and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote.So Johnson’s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs’ desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament’s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation.Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it’s hard to define what’s “unconstitutional” in a system with an unwritten constitution.Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A “political” constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely.The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d3983b83f8c347470457bd319e492499b69718/0_0_6522_3913/master/6522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1286b0df995bbcd3fdb2d1144e61651e","title":"being human wellcome collection exhibition","story":"An unusual astronaut is at the centre of a new exhibition of art and scientific artefacts designed to make us think about everything from our personal lives to the fate of humanity itself“It’s hard to think of a greater challenge to our future health than environmental breakdown,” says Clare Barlow, project curator of Wellcome Collection’s newest gallery. Opening on Thursday 5 September, Being Human is a new permanent exhibit that explores trust, hope and fear, identity and health in the 21st century through four sections: genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown.The space, which for 12 years housed Medicine Now, has been redesigned with reclaimed wood panelling and warm colours by the Turner prize-winning arts and architecture collective Assemble. The exhibition “explores our relationship with ourselves, with each other and with the world around us”, Barlow says. Each of the four sections asks a different question. “With minds and bodies the question is, why do we sometimes act like we value some lives more than others? With environmental breakdown, we ask why it’s so hard for us to act on climate change, when its effects are already here. And with that, the question of how we’re reacting to what’s being lost and how we see ourselves living in the future.”Being Human displays imposing works of art alongside other artefacts, which include seeds withdrawn from the Svalbard global seed vault, a storage facility created by the Norwegian government in 2008 to protect vital crops such as wheat against global disasters, war or disease, and a commercially available gene-editing kit, items intended to ground the conceptual nature of the artworks in a scientific context. These are contrasted with pieces by established artists such as Deborah Kelly’s No Human Being Is Illegal (in All Our Glory), Kia LaBeija’s Eleven, a self-portrait of the black artist, who is living with HIV, and Superflex’s short film Flooded McDonald’s, which questions with whom responsibility for environmental breakdown lies: the customer or the corporation?Visitors move from the genetics section, a “distillation of what makes us us” to an exploration of our relationships with our bodies and minds, then to our relationship with others and, finally, to our relationship with the planet and our grief for what has already been lost. They will be “progressing from things that feel deeply personal, and really allow them to scrutinise questions of identity, to reflecting on the global impact of environmental breakdown”.At the centre of the exhibit is Refugee Astronaut, by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare. The traveller, wearing a spacesuit of Dutch wax fabric and moon boots, carries a net of possessions on his back containing a telescope, an old camera and a star map, as well as evocatively titled books The Last Migration and The Quest for the Perfect Place. Barlow says these items are jumping-off points from which visitors can create their own idea of where the astronaut is heading.Is the astronaut a refugee from Earth or is the artwork grounded in the current refugee crisis? “It can be read both ways,” says Barlow. “There’s a strong antithesis going on. Astronauts are cosmic explorers and then the word ‘refugee’ ties it to a very specific context. It pulls together so many different ideas, opening up questions around colonialism and the environment.”Shonibare’s commission is the third in the Refugee Astronaut series, which began as criticism of colonialism and exploitation and its historical annexation, explains the artist. Each sculpture’s spacesuit has a different pattern, the latest of which is of green lines and clouds “to signify an ebbing relationship with nature, due to climate change”.It is with good reason that this work serves as the exhibition’s keystone. “Refugee Astronaut is a metaphor for a post-apocalyptic figure, with his worldly possessions on his back, seeking conflict-free and environmentally clean, greener pastures,” says Shonibare. The work can be read either as “dystopian, or a note of caution” against “catastrophic climate events that will increasingly lead to migration and a scramble for scarce resources, leading to global conflict”.The astronaut can be glimpsed from any point in the gallery, a constant reminder of the end point, the “ultimate progression”. “Maybe in this future, leaving Earth will be the only answer,” Barlow muses. “It’s a question mark on the end of the collection’s progression.”Being Human opens on 5 September at the Wellcome Collection, London NW1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

But tell that to Vasiliy Lomachenko. The brilliant Ukrainian defied a large height and reach disadvantage to add the WBC world lightweight title to his WBA and WBO belts with a gaping points victory over Luke Campbell. Most boxing experts rate Lomachenko as the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter. Watching the master at work it was again hard to argue.But on a night of jangled nerves and jumbled memories Campbell did himself proud with a brilliant and courageous performance. Two judges made it 119-108, with another giving it 118-109, which seemed a touch harsh on the 31-year-old from Hull. Certainly the crowd thought so. As the fighters embraced at the end 20,000 people at the 02 Arena stood up and chanted: “There’s only one Luke Campbell.”They knew the mountain Campbell had to climb could not have been much steeper. In Lomachenko he was facing a man who had ended his amateur career with two Olympic gold medals and a 396-1 record – and then claimed three world titles at different weights in a record time as a professional.“He’s a special fighter,” Campbell said. “I’m disappointed. “Tonight was Lomachenko’s night but my time will come.”This was the biggest fight of Campbell’s life but he showed little apprehension in the opening stages, keeping his right hand high and pawing out his left almost in slow motion. Lomachenko for his part appeared on a recce mission, waiting to find out what was waiting in his opponent’s arsenal. The crowd had expected blood and thunder. Instead, initially, it was more like slow-motion shadow boxing – with Lomachenko landing only one punch in the opening three minutes.The cageyness continued in the second as Campbell continued to use his five-inch reach and three-inch height advantage to keep his opponent off balance and at a distance. If Lomachenko was frustrated it did not show but he continued to have little success in prising Campbell open until a sharp combination landed at the end of the round.Finally Lomachenko began to score more freely with a jolting right down the middle followed a left to the top of the head, leading to most of the crowd calling his name. Indeed as he heard the beery cries of “Loma‑chenko” he could have been forgiven for thinking he was in downtown Kyiv, not east London.Yet it took until the fourth for Campbell to be knocked backwards by two vicious body shots, as Lomachenko went from first gear to fourth in a few seconds. His pace only intensified in the fifth as in a frenzied 20 seconds Campbell was hit by a blur of hooks that began pummelling his body and switched to his head and left him perilously close to going down before the bell saved him.More inexperienced fighters might have rushed in at the start of the sixth round, looking for the finish. Lomachenko, though, sensed that Campbell still had plenty of spite – and fight – left in him. But he was soon peppering Campbell’s head again with short left hands.The crowd appreciated Campbell’s bravery. “Campbell! Campbell!” they cried, and he responded with a sharp left hook to the body in the sixth and a good hook in the seventh buckled his opponent. They rose to their feet, sensing an almighty upset might be about to happen but Lomachenko responded magnificently with a right hook that had Campbell fumbling backwards and clinging on again.In the eighth Lomachenko’s fists continued to contain the greater devilment but Campbell was giving it everything to stay with his opponent. He certainly was earning his opponent’s respect – and he may have also won the ninth round as Lomachenko took his foot off the gas.With three rounds to go Campbell was continuing to do better than most had predicted. But he was getting desperately tired and with just over a minute left in the 11th round he was felled by a right and left hook to the body followed by a right to the head. Again he survived and the crowd were on their feet to applaud him as he came out for the last.Campbell continued to press, hoping for a big punch to turn the tables. Instead he was left hanging on to Lomachenko’s legs after another frenzied attack from the Ukrainian nearly put him down. Still it was only right that he stayed on his shield after such a supreme effort. He will come again. But Lomachenko was – as usual – different class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ffd24a9afde4d02e1aeb5c46b3a434761d3ecd/0_7_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07bd74fc7603888f3a4b1fd8d9076320","title":"ben stokes hero headingley england buccaneering totem ashes","story":"In the delirious aftermath of the World Cup final in July, Jos Buttler had a quick chat with Michael Vaughan on the Lord’s outfield. The conversation soon turned to the bizarre incident in the final over of normal time, when Martin Guptill’s throw hit Ben Stokes’s bat and raced to the boundary. “That,” whispered Buttler, “was the first thing he middled all day.”Buttler’s comment was playful and affectionate, yet there was a bit of truth in it. For almost all of that innings, Stokes was frustrated by his inability to time the ball on a difficult pitch. He hit three fours in his first 85 balls, before the situation demanded that he go nuclear. Stokes has oodles of skill, especially with the bat. He is one of the few batsmen who can play every shot in the 20th- and 21st-century batting textbooks. But his true superpower, the thing that has enabled his twin miracles this summer, is his will. He belongs to that rare group of all-action sporting heroes who believe they can climb Everest with a hangover, or save the Ashes by scoring more in a last-wicket partnership than the whole team managed in the first innings.Stokes did not just bring England back from the dead last Sunday he brought them back from a cremation. It was an astonishing achievement, euphoric confirmation of his greatness. The relative modesty of Stokes’s numbers in Test cricket – he averages 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball – are sometimes used in evidence against him. But trying to assess his impact through statistics is like trying to quantify love. It should surprise nobody if Stokes gets a pair at Old Trafford. He has always had wild fluctuations in form and has been fighting self‑doubt ever since, at the age of 14, he puked through nerves before his debut for Cumbria.“I’m going to go through a period of low scores and not got too well,” said Stokes three years ago in his book, Firestarter. “But all of a sudden I know something can just happen for me. I’m not necessarily a form player, more of an in-the-moment player.”For such a great player, he can be a bit of a klutz. Carlos Brathwaite’s four sixes in the World T20 final will always be part of his story, and his career has been studded with absurd, absent-minded run-outs.Even at Headingley, he played a hideous shot in the first innings and ran out Buttler in the second. His never-ending bowling spell was partly a penance for that poor stroke. Technically, it was two spells, but in reality it was one, as Stokes had three balls off before returning to the attack when Jofra Archer was injured. In all he bowled 24.2 overs. Analysis from CricViz, who hold the largest database in cricket, show it is the longest spell by a pace bowler in international cricket since 2006.Stokes’s self-flagellation increased his determination to ensure England would not lose the Ashes, not on his watch. Stokes is allergic to defeat that, even more than the pursuit of glory, drives him. It was telling that, off the final ball of the World Cup final, when England needed two to win and one to tie, Stokes’s sole thought was to bunt the ball into a gap so that he would get at least one run and ensure England would live to fight another over.Stokes had some crazy moments of fortune at Lord’s. Whether you make your own luck is debatable but Stokes certainly gives himself the opportunity to get lucky by keeping England in games that would otherwise have been long lost. The Brathwaite experience taught him that if you take a game deep enough, the strangest things can happen. Stokes also knows that, at moments of the highest pressure, something stirs in him: desperation, defiance, a heightened instinct, a bit of genius, and, most of all, an elemental force of personality.The greater the stakes, the more Stokes wants – needs – to be involved, which is why his career will always lurch between extremes of success and failure. He is a beacon of moral courage. As a bowler he is selectively used but it is indicative that he took the last wickets when England beat Bangladesh by 22 runs in 2016 and India by 31 runs at Edgbaston in 2018.When the mood takes him, or the situation demands, he will bowl forever. CricViz data shows that in his Test career he has bowled 12 spells of 10 overs or more. The sight of Stokes demonstrably knackered, either while batting or bowling, has become common.In the biggest moments, Stokes cannot hide his fatigue or his emotions – he could not watch when Jack Leach was batting last Sunday and he was one of the few England players who cried on the field after the World Cup final. He should have a tattoo of a heart on his sleeve.A big part of Stokes’s appeal is that, in an era of media‑training and image-consciousness, he is authentic, sometimes to a fault. He looks like a fan who has been placed in the body of Ben Stokes for the day. Many great players enjoy their work Stokes usually looks almost comically careworn. The enjoyment comes after the event, with a primal roar after he blasts the winning runs – just imagine how alive he felt at that moment at Headingley – and then behind closed doors with his mates.Despite all the emotion, Stokes played with startling clarity in both innings. While most spectators, never mind the players, were unable to think straight, Stokes had a precise gameplan each time. He is like a reverse swan – paddling furiously on the surface, serene under water. In that sense, Stokes is the ideal hero for these melodramatic times. In others, not so much. A judgmental minority, apparently born without the empathy gene, will never forgive or let him forget Bristol, and he is understandably tired of being asked about it. Yet he might reflect that it was a blessing in an extremely good disguise, one that was humbling rather than humiliating.While the year-long fallout was an experience Stokes probably would not wish on Marlon Samuels, it has accelerated his maturity and changed him almost exclusively for the better. He is much less confrontational, without any obvious impact on his ferocious competitiveness, and has become even more selfless.Stokes was always an exemplary team man but now his commitment to the collective verges on the obsessive. “Everything he does is for the team,” said Stuart Broad last Sunday. “He is the perfect teammate. He didn’t celebrate his fifty he didn’t celebrate his hundred. He deserves everything that comes his way because he’s an incredible cricketer and an even better bloke.”When he was younger, Stokes, like all kids, loved glory. Now his primary, if not sole motivation is a sense of duty – to his teammates, and to the talent he has been given.Stokes was always the most responsible and technically correct of England’s middle-order buccaneers. When he returned to the side last year, he took that to the point of self-denial. Now he has found a happier medium, one that allows him, in the same innings, to score two off 66 balls and 74 off 42.Armchair psychoanalysis is a dubious exercise but Bristol does seem to have made Stokes a wiser, warier man. He will never be perfect on or off the field, because that’s not who he is, but he has developed into a different kind of hero – a superstar with no side to him, and with little discernible ego or swagger. One who hunts glory on behalf of his mates and who will volunteer to go to the precipice every single time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb32e6071e16a20024208777b358cdd6990c00c0/0_33_4691_2815/master/4691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9287731926a037014e4419432f84ea9c","title":"naomi osaka ends coco gauffs us open fairytale","story":"The defending champion cruised into the fourth round with a comprehensive victory over her teenage opponent.On an emotional Saturday night at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Naomi Osaka showed that she is not going to relinquish her US Open title easily. The world number one outclassed Coco Gauff 6-3 6-0 to reach the fourth round in just 65 minutes.“I was just happy throughout this entire match. I think I kept a very high level of focus,” said Osaka afterwards. “I honestly think it’s been since the Australian Open finals that I was that focused and I was fighting that hard for every point.”Across the grounds of the Billie Jean King Tennis Center on Saturday afternoon, even as Rafael Nadal competed and US men’s number one John Isner fell, anticipation of the duel between Gauff and Osaka dominated conversation. Last year, Osaka defeated Serena Williams in the US Open final to rise as a new superstar of the sport. At Wimbledon this year, Gauff became one of the most talked about athletes in the world after her delirious run to the fourth round. It was always going to be a moment, as the two new stars faced each other on the biggest stage.“I’m just curious to see how my game matches up against her,” said Gauff, simply, before the match. She was not the only one. The teenager outplayed Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon, and then she survived two three-set slugfests to reach the third round at the US Open, but she had never faced the world number one.The biggest question of the match was Gauff’s long, loopy forehand that has a tendency to land short under pressure. Osaka immediately searched for answers, targeting the American’s weaker wing with her serve and in the bruising early exchanges. By the first two games, Osaka had five winners to Gauff’s zero. As Gauff’s forehand immediately looked vulnerable, Osaka hit cleanly and moved ahead 3-0.The 15 year-old settled eventually, slamming down a 119mph ace to hold for 1-3 and punctuating the mini-victory with a loud “c’mon” to the delight of the crowd. Many of the opening exchanges were electric as Osaka’s vicious power met Gauff’s lightning defence, but as the first set wore on, the occasion seemed to impact both. Despite boasting two of the biggest serves in the game, both Osaka and Gauff struggled with their deliveries and exchanged five successive breaks. From 5-3 and 0-30 down, Osaka eventually found her range to take the first set.Gauff tried to attack in the second set, but her risks yielded errors and the occasion seemed to dawn on her. Across the net, Osaka cut out her mistakes and served supremely. The match fell away quickly, but even at 6-3 4-0, Osaka was still pumping her fist as she scuppered Gauff’s game points.The intensity and verve that Osaka played with as she slammed the door shut seemed to answer all questions about whether Gauff would be able to hang with the best. After a warm handshake and a hug, the 21 year-old walked over to the 15 year-old and asked if they could do the on-court interview together. Gauff initially refused as tears welled in her eyes, but Osaka insisted and her beaten opponent agreed. After trading forehands and fist-pumps across the net all evening, they walked over to the same side of the court together.“I saw that she was kind of tearing up a little,” said Osaka. “Then it reminded me how young she was. I was just thinking, like, it would be nice for her to address the people that came and watched her play. They were cheering for her. Yeah, I mean, for me, it was just something that was, I don’t know, instinctive I guess.”There are distinct similarities between the rise of Osaka and Gauff, both on and off the court. Earlier in the tournament, Osaka stared across the locker room and saw herself as the 15 year-old quietly watching youtube with her headphones blocking out the world. They both spent their early years honing their careers in the academies of Florida. Gauff would notice Osaka occasionally, when she would drive away and see Osaka on the way out. But Osaka was always watching.“I literally was training at the same place as her.” said Osaka. “Like, we would never hit together, but it was always just us putting in the most amount of hours. She was always with her dad just practicing.”For Gauff, the match was a learning experience, but the moment the world number one took her under her wing was one to cherish.“I think she really showed sportsmanship tonight,” said Gauff. “I mean, I wasn’t expecting it. I’m glad that I was able to experience that moment. I’m glad the crowd was kind of helping me and her. She was crying, she won. I was crying. Everybody was crying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0609097307a81c089349a8545571160c32e12c5/35_204_5278_3168/master/5278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd0b8cb9e52fc5a46cf5b0cc7f94386e","title":"alan ayckbourn publishes his first novel the divide aged 80","story":"At 80, after writing 83 plays and earning seven Evening Standard theatre awards, two Oliviers, one Tony and a knighthood, Alan Ayckbourn will publish his debut novel this month.Set in a dystopian England a century from now, the British playwright and director imagines a world in which a plague has ravaged the population and men and women are strictly segregated. The story is told through Soween and her older brother Elihu, who grow up under a brutal dictatorship. Railing against the tyranny of a mendacious leader known as the Preacher, Elihu threatens to ignite a bloody revolution.“This is a new experience for me,” said Ayckbourn. “God knows how many nerve-racking theatre press nights and now this.

Lord, the things you take on at 80!”The Divide was originally staged as a six-hour, two-part play at Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph Theatre in 2015, before arriving at the Edinburgh international festival two years later.

The production was cut in half by the time it arrived at the Old Vic in 2018 and Ayckbourn has duly taken note.The fantasy and horror specialist PS Publishing describes its new signing’s work as a timely “fable that unflinchingly examines a dystopian society of brutal repression, forbidden love and seething insurrection”.The Divide will launch at a free event on 12 September at Stephen Joseph Theatre, where Ayckbourn was artistic director from 1972 to 2009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e1ad70da568158c834e8f4b07bb547a3a43982/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14613bc93c60716894fb93e8d4aeef1 1900w","title":"matera basilicata italy european capital of culture 2019","story":"After 10,000 years, the ancient city in Basilicata is having a moment: it’s a European capital of culture for 2019 – and even James Bond is making a visit‘This room is called Senza Nidd – without anything – because the people who lived here were so poor,” said the receptionist. Our modest-sized hotel room in Matera, southern Italy, once housed an entire family – not back in the middle ages, but within living memory. Matera, a troglodyte city in Basilicata, was considered “the shame of Italy” in the 1950s because of the extreme poverty and widespread disease in its ancient Sassi districts. The residents were compulsorily relocated and the crumbling city, thought to be possibly the third-oldest in the world after Aleppo and Jericho, lay empty for the first time in 10,000 years.Yet today it is full of tourists keen to visit one of the two 2019 European capitals of culture (the other is Plov, Bulgaria). Investment began trickling in from the late 1980s, and although the families that had been forced out never returned, many of their descendants came back to open hotels and restaurants. Matera got a boost when it became a world heritage site in 1993, and another when it starred as Jerusalem in Mel Gibson’s controversial The Passion of the Christ in 2004. In fact, filmmakers can’t resist it – the 25th Bond movie No Time To Die (released next year) is the latest blockbuster to be filmed here.I was visiting on a new Sassi and Trulli short break with Inntravel to find out what makes Matera so special. It didn’t take long to work out – this city is like nowhere else on Earth. The two Sassi (“stones”) districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, are built on natural caves that have been excavated and extended over millennia. A warren of pale limestone churches, monasteries, palaces and houses rises above the caves, all balanced on the edge of a ravine. By day, it is breathtaking lit up at dusk, it can bring you to tears.One of Matera’s unmissable sights is its chiese rupestri or rock churches. As well as those in the city, there are another 150 in the Park of the Rock Churches across the Gravina river, which can be reached on a guided tour or by bike (our trip included bike hire). The 12th-century Chiesa San Pietro Barisano is the biggest in the Sassi, its interiors completely carved out of the rock. My macabre partner perched in one of the sinister “draining chairs” in the crypt, where dead priests were once seated until their flesh had decomposed. Other standout rock churches include Santa Maria de Idris and the Convicinio di Sant’Antonio, which sit in a spectacular spot on a rocky spur. The 13th-century cathedral rises above the Sassi, reached via a steep tangle of alleyways.Another top sight is the Palombaro Lungo, a huge manmade water cistern dug into the rock during the 16th century. Its scale and ingenuity are certainly impressive, but it lacks the grandeur of, say, the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. We found a visit to a casa grotta more compelling – a handful of cave houses have been preserved as museums, complete with fixtures, fittings and model livestock. We visited Casa Grotta del Barisano, where a family of seven, plus farm animals, lived without electricity or running water until 1960.As befitting a capital of culture, Matera has several rewarding museums, including the Archaeological Museum, with a collection of 4th- and 5th-century Greek vases, and the Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, which includes work by Carlo Levi, whose 1945 book Christ Stopped at Eboli first alerted the world to the living conditions in this part of southern Italy. Our highlight was Musma, the Museum of Contemporary Sculpture, where cutting-edge sculpture is housed in centuries-old caves below and a 16th-century palace above.Matera has a rich culinary tradition. Restaurants showcase Basilicatan specialities, often called Lucanian cuisine after the region’s ancient name. Grains, pulses and vegetables dominate this cucina povera, with small amounts of meat and cheese. La Focagna, a cosy cave tavern that stays open until 2am, serves simple, affordable dishes. We ate crapiata, a delicious bean soup served with toasted Matera bread, followed by orecchiette with garlicky cime di rapa (a leafy brassica). More upmarket cave restaurants can be found on and around Via Bruno Buozzi, such as the one we chose, Morgan. A selection of starters included mashed fava beans with chicory, and was followed by pappardelle with wild boar sauce. We ordered peperoni cruschi on the side – these sun-dried red peppers from Senise are highly prized – and drank aglianico, Basilicata’s star grape.Café-thronged Piazza del Sedile was our favourite place for an afternoon pitstop I Due Sassi Café does a mean Campari spritz. The city’s main square is Piazza Vittorio Veneto in the 17th-century “new” town. It is the key spot for a passeggiata, and has incredible views over the Sassi skyline. Later in the evening, Mosto Osteria Della Birra is a lively bar for a beer or an amaro lucano, the local digestif. The hippest hangout is Area 8, a cocktail bar with film screenings and live music.Like the restaurants and bars, Matera’s hotels make the most of their unique architecture. We stayed in a simple cave room in Locanda di San Martino, a terraced 40-room hotel in the heart of the Sassi. The thermal baths beneath the hotel, in passages and cisterns carved out of the rock thousands of years ago, are sensational. We also spent a night in Palazzo degli Abati, which has two rooms in caves and three in an 18th-century palace. Our room had two million-year-old fossils in the walls.There may be something a little uncomfortable about tourists thronging to eat and sleep in peasant dwellings. After all, the previous occupants lived in caves and huts out of necessity. On the other hand, it is one way to preserve a piece of history – as well as the memory of the Senza Nidd family, and thousands like them.The trip was provided by Inntravel, which has a Sassi and Trulli self-guided hotel-to-hotel cycling short break from £695pp, including four nights’ B\u0026ampB accommodation, two dinners, cycle hire, route notes and maps, luggage transported between hotels and return taxi fromto Bari airport.

No one was injured, according to a report sent to Trump administration officials and seen by the Associated Press.The woman walked into the office on Friday afternoon and threw a bottle filled with gasoline. A lit fuse disconnected from the bottle and the device did not ignite, according to the report.Law enforcement officials believe the woman intended to cause harm but the incident was not related to other recent instances in which homeland security agencies were targeted.Earlier this month in San Antonio, Texas, at least one vehicle pulled up to a building that houses offices for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, and a gunman fired shots through a window, FBI officials said. No one was injured. Another building used by Ice was also fired on.Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of the agency, which handles legal immigration, said in a tweet the incident was “another example of the use of violence in place of debate by those who oppose the proper application of our immigration laws”.Security officers handcuffed the woman and she was taken into custody by Federal Protective Service officers. Court documents said the incident was captured on video.The woman, Cellicia Hunt, was charged with maliciously attempting to damage or destroy a government building by fire, according to court records. The 35-year-old was expected to appear in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday.She was being held without bail in a local jail on Saturday and it was not immediately clear if she had an attorney.No one was injured, though one person reported feeling ill from the smell of gasoline. The office was closed.The incident came amid federal investigators’ growing concerns about attacks on immigration agencies during a time of heightened emotion and scrutiny, as Donald Trump tries to move ahead with major changes and energize his base by delivering on campaign promises.Cuccinelli, who backs Trump’s hardline immigration policies, has presided over recent changes that have drawn criticism.One could deny green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance. Cuccinelli has also defended changes to a long-standing agreement that governs how children cared for in government custody and how long they can be detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a5b15aec8aac5d9c093a76ccb62805636062bd/0_169_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61d95072bbd81bae210ba3fafdce7c4e","title":"us iranian tanker adrian darya syria","story":"The US has blacklisted the Iranian tanker Adrian Darya, saying it had “reliable information” it was transporting oil to Syria in defiance of wide-ranging sanctions on the regime of Bashar al-Assad.Previously known as Grace 1, the vessel was seized in July by British marines and held in Gibraltar for six weeks, on suspicion it was delivering oil for Tehran’s ally Damascus.The British territory released the ship – despite US protests – after it said it had received written assurances from Iran that the vessel would not head for countries under European Union sanctions. Tehran later denied it had made any promises.“We have reliable information that the tanker is underway and headed to Tartus, Syria,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in a tweet on Friday.The US treasury said the vessel was “blocked property” under an anti-terrorist order, and “anyone providing support to the Adrian Darya 1 risks being sanctioned”.The ship’s captain, Akhilesh Kumar, was blacklisted under the order.Since its release from Gibraltar, the Adrian Darya has been bouncing around the Mediterranean, its every move followed. The vessel was in waters north of Cyprus as of early Saturday, according to the MarineTraffic website.Lebanon earlier dismissed Turkish claims that it would receive the ship, which has a cargo of 2.1 million barrels worth around $140m.While Iran has denied selling the oil to Damascus, experts said the likely scenario was for a ship-to-ship transfer, with a Syrian port the final destination.Maritime traffic monitors had shown that the Adrian Darya’s latest listed destinations, which are not necessarily the next approved port of call, were in Turkey. After tracking sites showed Mersin as its destination, it then switched to Iskenderun, prompting a reaction from Turkey’s foreign minister.“This tanker is not heading actually to Iskenderun, this tanker is heading to Lebanon,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Oslo.Lebanon dismissed that scenario, stressing that it never buys crude oil because it does not have refineries, and adding that it had not received any docking requests from the tanker.Iran said on Monday it had “sold the oil” aboard the tanker and that the owner will decide the destination. It did not identify the buyer or say whether the oil had been sold before or after the tanker’s detention.It also said it could not name the actual destination due to “economic terrorism” by the US and its sanctions on Iran’s oil sales.In July, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard impounded a British-flagged tanker in Gulf waters. Britain called it a tit-for-tat move but Tehran denied any connection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f062c3c5ac0e37455115bbedeeaf163dd86f49/0_168_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=294f35de2d64b41b64e3a49d708fd228","title":"what french think of the english","story":"Frenchman Benjamin Carle likes a challenge. First he set out to live using only French-made products. Then he decided to make a sandwich from scratch, including growing his own wheat and catching his own tuna.Now Carle, 31, has completed what may be his toughest test so far: trying to understand and identify with the English.The idea, triggered by Brexit, is the subject of his latest documentary, Meilleurs Ennemis – Ma Relation Avec La Perfide Albion (Best of Enemies – My Relation with Perfidious Albion).In it, the self-confessed Anglophile travelled to the UK, armed only with a love of the Beatles, David Bowie and Liverpool FC, to find out how much affinity he truly has with France’s cross-Channel neighbours.During this journey, he visits Basildon (having been told it is the heart of Middle England), discovers the mysteries of the British pub, jellied eels, afternoon tea, imperial measures and Marmite. As a result of his trip, he decides he is not as English as he had thought.“I thought it would be easier to be English,” he admits, during an interview at the République of Coffee (questionable Gallic credentials) in Paris. Carle is early (not at all French), gives two bises (a peck on each cheek – very French) and commits the Parisian sacrilege of ordering a large mug of filter coffee.“I didn’t exactly think it would be easy but I thought my love for England and my understanding of the codes and particularities would help. Instead, I came back to France and realised I was more French than I thought,” he says, almost ruefully.“Still,” he perks up: “At a time when everyone watches the same television series, listens to the same music and has the same cultural references, it’s good that there are so many differences between countries that are so close. We don’t need to all have the same cultural identity.”Carle’s documentary, to be aired on Canal+ in September, opens at a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings won by William the Conqueror in 1066. “I discovered it’s such an important date in England, but relatively little known in France, perhaps because William was Norman and France wasn’t a unified country back then.“We went back through the history books and calculated that in roughly 1,000 years of history there have been a total of 250 years of war in 30 conflicts between France and England and millions of deaths, most of them, unlike Hastings, outside of England.”Carle suggests the roots of the current love-hate relationship between France and England dates back to Joan of Arc in the 15th century. “We learn in school to thank Jeanne d’Arc for kicking the English out of France. It was a deliberate political policy to create this legend, to say here is the enemy, we kicked them out and now France is French it’s our country. Even if we know history isn’t quite that simple, it has become the cement holding our nation together.”In the film, we see Carle out with members from the Active Resistance to Metrication, whose undercover late-night operations involve changing road signs from metres and kilometres to yards and miles.“They were mostly older men, Brexiters who said the English had used their own system for ever and they didn’t see why it had to change. They were real rebels, but ultra-polite and correct and very precise about how they pasted their stickers,” he says.Carle says he didn’t want to make a programme focused on Brexit, but he was surprised by the casual attitude of the English towards their impending departure from the EU. “I was there in the run-up to the original Brexit day in March. When I mentioned the risks or asked if people were worried, they said: ‘It’s OK, there’s time.’ And there were no demonstrations. That surprised me, but I’m a bit English in that way. I complain about things afterwards,” he says.So what did Carle like, dislike and not understand after his journey of discovery among the people the French love to hate?“I didn’t like that people found it impossible to say no. They wouldn’t say, ‘No, sorry, I don’t want to be interviewed by you’, they’d make excuses. Just say no,” he says. “Then there were the constant references to the French being ‘cowards’.“I liked the absence of harassment of women in the streets France has a lot to learn here. And I liked English jokes like: how do you plant an English lawn? You sow the seeds and wait for it to rain for 600 years.”The food? “Hmm, people kept saying it has improved, but to be honest, I didn’t find it that good. Jellied eels that manage to be both salty and tasteless, meat pies with gelatinous parsley sauces, and cutting afternoon tea cakes into small pieces. What’s that about?”And Marmite? (In the documentary, Carle is seen pasting a thick layer of the yeast-extract spread over his toast.) “Non, non, non,” he grimaces. “Why do you eat this thing? Is it something that’s part of your heritage that you just can’t let go of?“To be honest, I think the English are more open to the world and know France better than the French know the English. And that means they like us more. Sometimes we French are very self-satisfied and smug we think we know England because we have visited London for the weekend, but we know very little about the English.And that, he says, is a good thing. Vive la différence!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db57454f63647061131def8b296bfc789c1420d/0_230_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=770628b056ea29baef471723ed1ffcb4","title":"afd bids to encirle berlin saxony brandenburg state elections","story":"Crucial elections in two eastern states of Germany could be about to change the political direction of the country, with polls showing the potential of the far right to emerge as the strongest force.Five million Germans are eligible to vote on Sunday in Saxony and Brandenburg in election battles that could have a resounding impact on the federal government in Berlin and have been fuelled by debates on the success and failures of German reunification, with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall coming this autumn.The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) faces its first real electoral test in the region. At the last state election, five years ago, the party was just a year old and lacking clout.All parties have ruled out going into coalition with the AfD, meaning that tense negotiations almost certainly lie ahead.Analysts agree that if the AfD tops the polls it will represent the biggest political earthquake for Germany since the end of the cold war, marking the first time a rightwing populist force has taken control in postwar Germany.The size of the AfD’s gains after a campaign focused on appealing to – and amplifying – a collective feeling of abandonment have been most keenly felt in Saxony. There, it is expected to take half or a third of seats from the CDU, which in 2014 secured 59 out of 60 constituencies.Its election slogan “Vollende die Wende”, or “Complete the transition” – stealing the phrase used in 1989 to describe the change from communism to liberal democracy – is an invitation to topple the status quo just as protesters brought about the East German revolution.“The AfD is not the cause of the upset we’re seeing, neither is it iding society,” said Andreas Kalbitz, the AfD’s leading candidate in Brandenburg, fresh from an election rally. “The AfD is the consequence of the failure of others.”Born in Munich, the former paratrooper settled in Brandenburg with his British wife and children more than a decade ago. His contacts with far-right sympathisers have made repeated headlines in Germany in recent months as he positions himself to oust Dietmar Woidke, who has been Brandenburg’s state premier since 2013. Those headlines continued last week when he admitted he had attended a neo-Nazi rally in 2007 in the Greek capital, Athens.Kalbitz insists it is largely western Germans’ lack of empathy towards easterners, and the widespread perception that they plundered the east of its wealth in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of communism, that has fuelled much of the resentment among Brandenburgers.“It has been forgotten in the west,” he said. “But people in the east have not forgotten how people came with their fast cars and closed down the businesses, so as to clear the field of competition for western businesses.”Matthias Platzeck, who was Brandenburg’s premier until 2013, said: “Democracy here is on the precipice of a crisis. People have the overwhelming feeling that, following both the finance and the refugee crises, the state has lost control.“The AfD is exploiting this latent sense of insecurity and has the same explanation for everything: if your bus is late or a train is cancelled, some Iraqi or other must be to blame.”The campaigns – the state of Thuringia follows on 27 October – have thrown the reunification project into sharp relief. Often presented as an unparalleled success story, which has involved an injection of more than 2 trillion euros to fund welfare benefits and infrastructure, the AfD has sought to present it as colonial-style exploitation and failure, pointing to the exodus of 1.9 million people from the former German Democratic Republic since 1990.Taking a stroll through the centre of Potsdam, the prosperous capital of Brandenburg famous for its historic buildings, Günter Koll, a retired engineer, said he believed the false priorities of a string of governments were to blame for the disenchantment.“A succession of governments here has put the emphasis on nice facades and flat roads,” the 71-year-old Potsdam native said, pointing at reconstructed baroque buildings. “That’s all well and good, but I think often they’ve forgotten the actual people. A lot of people are angry and lonely. They don’t feel useful.”He insisted he would not be voting for the AfD, but has neighbours who would. “We’re generally less afraid of political change, as we’ve already experienced enough of it in our lives. It makes it easier for people to switch to the AfD.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e0cda4a4a553d8cfa20406fd9a718a811d95ec/107_152_2320_1392/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b55f0b24e30f6d77f5dd2290f4668ef","title":"channel people smugglers cram 30 into boats for six","story":"Children tell charity workers of being knocked into the water as attempts to reach UK from France increaseSmugglers are cramming up to 30 people on to small boats to cross the Channel from France to the UK, and children have been among those who have recently fallen overboard, campaigners have revealed.As crossing attempts surge at the close of summer amid rumours that Brexit will mean tighter border restrictions, criminal gangs are loading inflatable boats up to five times their capacity. Previously, people smugglers would put about eight passengers on each vessel.Maddy Allen of the charity Help Refugees, which works with more than 1,500 migrants around Calais and Dunkirk, said: “Up to 30 a boat is now commonplace. Boats are overcrowded we’ve had children knocked off the side.“There was a boat last week where four people ended up in the water. It’s often the responsibility of the other people on the boat to drag them out then the boat will usually either make it to the UK or be intercepted and taken back to French territory.”The heightened desperation follows emergency talks in Paris last Thursday between the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to intensify joint efforts to tackle the Channel crossings. The talks concluded with the government considering increasing the amount it pays France to deal with the issue, prompting critics to say the intervention will simply push people to pursue more dangerous routes.Migrants have been arriving in the UK almost daily over the past week. So far this year more than 1,000 people, including many children, are understood to have entered the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats, compared with fewer than 300 for the whole of 2018.Most attempt the crossing in inflatable boats with outboard motors that can safely carry about six people. Beaches around the seaside village of Wissant, about six miles from Calais, have become a favoured stretch for boats leaving France.“We’re hearing all the same issues associated with the Mediterranean crossings: the boats start to take on water,” said Allen. “Then there’s not having the proper lifejackets.”Rachel Sykes of the charity Project Play, which works with about 300 children in the Grande-Synthe area of Dunkirk, said some minors had been taken to hospital after falling into the sea during failed crossings. She added: “Children often emphasise it’s not a safe thing for them to be doing, which is heartbreaking. That means they’ll be forced to do it again and again.”Charities say the mental health of migrants in northern France is worse than they have ever known, and more serious than seen in the Calais camp destroyed by the French authorities in 2016.Chloé Lorieux, programme coordinator of Doctors of the World UK, part of the Médecins du Monde network, said self-harm, substance abuse and depression are more widespread.Clare Morris, co-founder of Project Play, said: “We don’t know how often each family tries, plus it varies from family to family, but it is frequent. Children will often tell us on consecutive days about what has happened the previous night in relation to crossings.”Meanwhile, police are investigating the death of a woman who fell from a boat in poor weather while crossing the Channel on 9 August. Last Friday off the Belgian coast, police found the body of an Iraqi migrant wearing a homemade lifejacket of empty water bottles, who had drowned while trying to swim to the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54bd6d0e3c460d2595e233751fad9816d934177/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f86e26b35f09b5bade45eab6a5e09073","title":"pope francis gets stuck lift for 25 minutes vatican","story":" Pontiff apologises for arriving late to St Peter’s Square and says he was freed by firefightersPope Francis has said he got stuck in a lift for 25 minutes at the Vatican and had to be rescued by firefighters.The pontiff apologised to the faithful gathered in St Peter’s Square on Sunday for showing up seven minutes late to his traditional noon appointment with the public.Apparently referring to electric power, Francis said a “drop in tension” caused the problem.

Photograph: Denis CharletAFPGetty ImagesFrance will test run for a month measures it has prepared for Britain’s exit from the European Union so that companies are fully prepared ahead of the current Brexit deadline at the end of October, including if there is no withdrawal deal, a government minister said on Friday.Gerald Darmanin, who is in charge of customs, met Michael Gove, the British minister in charge of co-ordinating no-deal Brexit planning, in Calais on Friday to show how France is preparing for the British departure.For one month the French authorities will act as if Brexit has occurred to make sure they are ready by the end of October, Mr Darmanin said.“We are getting ready for the worst,” he said. “We are preparing for a no-deal Brexit, which is the likeliest hypothesis as of today,” he said. He did not give a specific date for the start of the test run.British prime minister Boris Johnson has promised to take the country out of the bloc on October 31st regardless of whether a orce deal has been agreed.Businesses have been warning of long tailbacks for lorries transporting goods between mainland Europe and Britain. The British government has said most goods from the EU will be allowed into Britain without full customs checks for at least three months if there is a no-deal Brexit.Mr Darmanin said some 700 extra customs officers have been drafted in and authorities will also introduce online border declarations forcing companies to announce their goods prior to arriving at the border.When all the paperwork is done ahead of time online, trucks will be able to move fast through the border, he said.He said his services are ready to deal with the new paperwork, the new taxes and the additional controls that will be set up.“We want to make things as painless as possible,” he said. The automation and digitalisation of the processes will make traffic fluid near the country’s ports and there will not be massive traffic jams in Calais, he said.French authorities spent €6 million on new buildings and car parks in the town, and set up new infrastructure in other ports including Le Havre and La Rochelle.France is the EU’s biggest agricultural producer and exports large amounts of wine, spirits and dairy products to Britain, while relying on its neighbour’s waters to sustain its fishing industry. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Opposition politicians plan to act next week to stop no-deal in parliament.Writing in the same newspaper, Mr Johnson’s de facto deputy Michael Gove said that to remove the option of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st would “diminish” the “chances of securing changes” to the Brexit deal that could get it passed through parliament. RebelsMeanwhile, Mrs Johnson has launched a war of words against would-be Tory Brexit rebels.As Downing Street ratcheted-up the rhetoric, ministers branded a cross-party alliance of MPs seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit as “deceitful and underhand”.Tory politicians like ex-chancellor Philip Hammond reacted angrily to claims Conservative MPs voting against a no-deal option when parliament returns this week could be barred from standing in a snap general election.In his first newspaper interview since becoming prime minister in July, Mr Johnson told the Sunday Times: “I just say to everybody in the country, including everyone in parliament, the fundamental choice is this: are you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum?“Are you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people — and plunge this country into chaos.”The comments came ahead of an expected Commons clash on Tuesday when opponents of no- deal look set to try and seize control of the parliamentary agenda to push through legislation that would force Mr Johnson to seek a Brexit extension from Brussels beyond October 31st.Staunch Johnson ally and Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, strongly attacked such an action.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “They dare not use the confidence procedures because they know that Jeremy Corbyn is too unpopular, and therefore they seek deceitful ends by underhand means.”Reports that any bid to extend Brexit to stop a no-deal exit would be treated as a no confidence issue, with supporting Tory MPs stopped from standing for the party, drew a harsh response from Mr Hammond.The ex-chancellor tweeted: “If true, this would be staggeringly hypocritical: 8 members of the current cabinet have defied the party whip this year.“I want to honour our 2017 manifesto which promised a ‘smooth and orderly’ exit and a ‘deep and special partnership’ with the EU.A British government spokesperson said: “All options for party management are under consideration, but first and foremost the PM hopes MPs will deliver on the referendum result and back him on parliament.”Some 20 Tory former ministers are considering standing at the next election as independent Conservatives rather than back a no-deal option, the Sunday Times said.Tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated against Mr Johnson’s plans to suspend parliament for up to five weeks ahead of the return of MPs from their summer recess.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Lives cannot be replaced,” Mr Minnis warned.Mr Minnis said that 73,000 people and 21,000 homes were at risk to storm surges of up to 4.6 metres.“Dorian will now create prolonged periods of large swells, surges along the north coast of Grand Bahama and the north and east coast of Abaco,” said Jeffrey Simmons, the deputy director of Bahamas’ department of meteorology.“We are asking residents in those areas to leave the coastline, we expect a storm surge of up to 15 feet, in addition to that we have a spring tide that can increase the surge by 2 to 3 feet,”Mr Simmons added.Potential damage caused by Dorian’s winds and storm surge could be exacerbated by the fact that its westward motion over the Bahamas is forecast to slow down keeping it over the islands for longer, the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.Once the storm unleashes its fury on the archipelago nation, people will have to ride out Dorian before first responders can venture outside to rescue anyone.Rescue workers “will not be able to move with 145 or 150 mile per hour winds ... so those iniduals that want to move I advise that they move now,” said Mr Minnis.Grand Bahama and Abaco are hubs for the Bahamas’ thriving tourism industry. The nation owes nearly 30 per cent of its direct gross domestic product and half of its jobs to the industry, Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Ministry of Tourism, said.But after days of evacuations only 26 tourists are left on Grand Bahama. -

someone who is mainly vegetarian but eats meat and fish occasionally \u0027hangry\u0027, an adjective to describe someone who is irritable because they are hungry and \u0027freegan\u0027 - someone who tries to find free food to cut down on waste.Among newly-coined terms which emerged in the noughties are \u0027smart fridge\u0027, an appliance connected to the internet which can track expiry dates \u0027free-from\u0027, which refers to foods without allergens like gluten and dairy and \u0027clean eating\u0027 - the practice of eating only healthy and natural foods.\u0027Veganuary\u0027, an event in January promoting veganism, first entered the dictionary in 2014.Meanwhile the term \u0027soggy bottom\u0027 was coined by The Great British Bake Off stars Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in 2010 to describe an under-cooked base of a pie or a filling which is too moist.Before 2012 the 5:2 diet was unheard of, but now refers to a calorie-controlled regime of eating normally for five days then fasting for two.Some of the more unusual phrases to enter our food lexicon in the last three decades are \u0027wonky fruit \u0026amp veg\u0027, meaning those which are misshapen or less aesthetically pleasing, and \u0027unicorn food\u0027, which refers to desserts brightly decorated in glitter.The term \u0027gastropub\u0027, meaning a pub which serves high quality food, was first used in 1996, while \u0027nose-to-tail eating\u0027 emerged in 1999 to mean eating the whole animal rather than just the popular cuts.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

before you die Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas.

But, he tells Andy Martin, he’s proud of building an ‘unknown little British tech company’ that can take on the likes of giants like AppleClick to followThe IndependentJohn Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal. He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. “I used to think software was some kind of lingerie,” he says.Then he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. “There was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn’t read or write. He’d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,” he says.And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and\u0026nbspmake more units – for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “The\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspwas spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely,” he explains, adding: “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\u0026nbspNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic\u0026nbsp(as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012,\u0026nbspLightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers.\u0026nbspThey design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps\u0026nbspin some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent\u0026nbspof all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. “She can’t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,” he says.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as\u0026nbspHoneywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. “They’re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user’s point of view.”Shermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. “It was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

A dream come true, says David Barnett, but it won’t be an easy taskClick to followThe IndependentAt a time when comic book movies rule the box office, it makes sense that one of the most beloved series in recent years gets an adaptation, courtesy of Netflix.When it’s a comic that was written by Neil Gaiman, the man behind book-to-TV hits American Gods and (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) Good Omens, it seems even more of a no-brainer.But while the comic in question, Sandman, holds a special place in the hearts of readers of both the hardcore geek variety and those who would never class themselves as comic nerds, its journey to the screen has been a troubled one and for many years the series was dismissed as simply unfilmable.When DC Comics published the first issue of The Sandman, with a cover date of January 1989, the industry was in the throes of a revolution.Titles such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight\u0026nbspReturns\u0026nbspheralded a new direction.\u0026nbspIt was proclaimed “Comics aren’t for kids any more!” as the superhero genre became grittier and darker, drenched in sex and violence that was much more than a sock on\u0026nbspthe jaw and a KA-POW!\u0026nbspSound effect.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.DC Comics, once the home of corny, brightly-coloured heroes such as Plastic Man and Arm-Fall-Off-Boy (no… really.\u0026nbspHe could take his arm off and hit people with it), was getting cool again. And that was largely thanks to a concerted effort\u0026nbspto bring in British writers and artists to overhaul some of their tired old plotlines and dream up brand new characters.tired tropes\u0026nbsp(DC Comics)A little before Sandman was published, DC brought out a comic called Hellblazer, featuring a British, street-level occultist called John Constantine who smoked and drank and screwed people over. Written by Jamie Delano, with art by John Ridgway, it set the tone for what was to come. In late 1988, DC started running ads for Sandman in the back of its comics. They showed a twinkle-eyed, pale-faced figure and the slogan, “I will show you terror in a handful of dust”.\u0026nbspIt was written by Neil Gaiman, with art initially by Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg and covers by Dave McKean. The advertising blurb was a slight mangling of a quote from TS Eliot’s “The Waste Land”. Gaiman was a name that no one outside of comics would have recognised at that point he’d been brought over to work for DC by forward-thinking editor Karen Berger after a smattering of comics work, including a graphic novel with the aforementioned McKean called Violent Cases. Sandman was published in the same format as the usual DC superhero comics, and billed as a “horror-edged fantasy”.Neil Gaiman: ‘I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett’Sandman certainly wasn’t about superheroes, though they sometimes featured in slightly grotesque ways. It wasn’t really a horror comic, though it was often horrific. It was fantastical rather than the epic fantasy of the doorstep-sized novels that filled the bookstores. If it wasn’t these things, then what was Sandman all about?The clever answer is that it’s about everything. In 75 monthly issues, from 1988 to 1996, Sandman covered every conceivable topic, from myth and legend to love and loss to identity politics to horror to birth and death to cats that hunt humans and dogs that talk. In a narrower sense, it’s about the Sandman, also known as\u0026nbspMorpheus\u0026nbspor Dream, one of a group of immortal siblings known as the Endless who rule over realms that correspond to, really, the components of the human heart. Alongside Dream, the roll call\u0026nbspincludes Destiny, Despair, Delirium, Destruction, Desire and, of course, Death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He rules over his domain where humans visit, fleetingly, as their bodies rest. He’s actually – whisper it – a bit boring. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humour, isn’t given to snappy rejoinders, and is often brooding over something, some lost love or threat to his realm. So it’s a good job that The Sandman comics are not really very often about him. They’re about the humans who interact with him, and their stories, their lives, which Dream sometimes just witnesses, and sometimes intervenes in.30th anniversary of the first issue\u0026nbsp(DC ComicsVertigo)Though Sandman is a narrative that covers much territory, not always in linear fashion, there is a silver thread running through all 75 issues (later collected into omnibus editions for easier reading) which begins with our introduction to Morpheus,\u0026nbspimprisoned for decades by an opportunistic Aleister Crowley-like English occultist. When he’s finally free, the Lord of Dreams returns to his realm to find it crumbling and in disarray, and sets out to retrieve his objects of power, fix things up, and make right all the chaos that has occurred in his absence.Gaiman was pretty much\u0026nbspunknown when he started writing Sandman (Getty)In early issues, he has to track down the denizens of his domain who have escaped while he’s been gone, and travel to hell to free a lover he wronged thousands of years previously. He meets Shakespeare and gods\u0026nbspand ordinary people thrust into ordinary situations. The series ends with his death but like everything that went before, nothing is as it seems in the land of dreams.The series was an instant hit. It was the comic for people who didn’t read comics, and the comic for those that did. Gaiman must have cast some bewitching hex, because he managed to build a fanbase that was full of cool people and outsiders and comic nerds and punks and pretty much everybody. Everybody loved Sandman. The singer-songwriter Tori Amos loved Sandman. The great American man of letters Norman Mailer called Sandman “a comic strip for intellectuals”. Charles Shaar Murray, the music journalist and author, writing in this very newspaper in 1997, on the release of the final volume of the collected Sandman story, called it “a major achievement. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else.”A plethora of artists have illustrated the Sandman comics. They include Colleen Doran, Jill Thompson, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham, Malcolm Jones III, Charles Vess, Kelley Jones, Matt Wagner, P Craig Russell, and more. All have brought their own touch to Dream and the Endless, but of course the one constant has always been writer Neil Gaiman.In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale\u0026nbsp… And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hardGaiman was pretty much an unknown when he started writing Sandman. He wasn’t even that well known a year or so later when he published, along with Terry Pratchett, the novel Good Omens. By the year 2001, when his first proper solo novel, American Gods, was out, he was a little better known, enough to be interviewed by CNN. He demurred at the suggestions that he was now famous, commenting:\u0026nbsp“I’m not and never will be a John Grisham.”Still, he had his fanbase by then, and it was quite a wide-ranging one. He is quoted in the same interview as describing his market as “a handful of beautiful goths and a handful of boys in dresses and a handful of sci-fi fans and a handful of nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal and the people who look like somebody’s mum. I exist at the intersection of a dozen Venn diagrams.”Now, though, it could be argued that Gaiman has certainly achieved Grisham-esque levels of literary fame, certainly since his 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane took up residence at the top of the bestseller lists. From then on,\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspbecame a hot property.His works Stardust and Coraline have been adapted into movies, but it wasn’t until the rise of the big-budget, ambitious TV series, heralded by the likes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, that his oeuvre found its natural home. American Gods and Good Omens have both been adapted for TV on Amazon Prime, and Sandman is next, snapped up by Netflix earlier this month.It’s not quite a case of a goldrush to mine Gaiman’s back catalogue for new hits though. For starters, unlike most of his other work, Sandman isn’t Gaiman’s copyright he did the work for DC comics, and the characters he wrote and created belong to them. DC certainly hasn’t been resting on its laurels with turning its intellectual property into TV shows… series such as Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Titans\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDoom Patrol have been big hits. Shows that are more thematically aligned to Sandman, such as Constantine, based on the comic Hellblazer, appeared, while another adaptation at the darker end of the DC universe, Swamp Thing, has just debuted.Tennant and Michael Sheen in ‘Good Omens’, which Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp(BBCAmazon)People have been trying to get Sandman on to the screen for almost as long as the comic has been produced. From the late 1990s, Warner Bros, which owns DC Comics, had been trying to get a Sandman movie made. Roger Avary, who worked alongside Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, was slated to direct, but fell out with the company and it never happened. New attempts were made one screenplay sent to Gaiman is said to have evoked the response from him that it was “not only the worst Sandman script I’ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I’ve ever read”.By 2013, when Sandman had been in and out of development hell more often than the character had been in actual hell (which was quite frequently the TV series Lucifer, starring Tom Ellis, is essentially a spin-off series of Sandman, featuring the version of Satan that Gaiman created for the comic), something more concrete appeared to be on the cards. Producer David S Goyer announced that he would be leading a film adaptation, working with actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gaiman, with British screenwriter Jack Thorne on script duties.spinoff featuring Satan from ‘Sandman’ and his adventures on Earth (Fox)It underwent several rewrites and by 2016 Gordon-Levitt dropped out of the project, citing differences with the studio over how he thought the direction of the movie should go. The adaptation petered out, with the general feeling that the scope and breadth of Sandman was just too ambitious to be contained in the movie format.Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeEnter, not Sandman, but Netflix. On 30 June\u0026nbspit was announced in Hollywood Reporter that the adaptation was back on, only as an ongoing series on the streaming TV provider, not as a movie. Which is pretty much the best result for a story of this size. David Goyer is back on board, as is Gaiman, whose stock in the TV world has massively risen since the adaptations of Good Omens and American Gods, which he\u0026nbspexecutively produced.One possible question mark people might have over the adaptation is whether the Sandman story has any relevance in 2019, more than 20 years after the main series ended (there have been many spinoffs, and DC recently launched a Sandman Universe\u0026nbspof titles featuring the characters, overseen by Gaiman but created by a new team of comic writers and artists). Good Omens is of a similar vintage to Sandman, but its apocalyptic themes were frighteningly recognisable in this year’s Amazon Prime adaptation, and American Gods was brought up to date nicely with its story of the old gods fading as faith in them wanes, and the new gods of technology, money and sex on the rise.Starz’s ‘American Gods’, Gaiman’s first solo novel\u0026nbsp(Starz)In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale. It’s character-driven rather than plot-heavy, which suits the Netflix model of delving into characters’ backstories and fleshing out the source material it adapts. And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hard. And dreams are not merely the stories we tell ourselves in our sleep they can be hopes and ambitions and wishes for ourselves and others. Perhaps there’s something to be said, also, about how willingly we submit to non-real states, especially online, which wasn’t a real consideration when Gaiman first wrote the series.Overall, Netflix certainly seems a safe pair of hands, and if anyone can do justice to the sprawling story of Dream and the Endless, then this old comics fan thinks it’ll probably be them. Another misgiving aficionados of the comics might have is that over its 75 issues, The\u0026nbspSandman didn’t really plough the sort of neat, linear furrow that TV series like to follow. Sandman is about everything, and that’s sometimes a big ask for a TV show to take on… and which led to the general opinion that it was simply not a thing you could adapt.It’s also a truth that great comics – or novels, for that matter – don’t necessarily make great TV shows or movies. To revisit an earlier point, a comic book isn’t just illustrated fiction. It’s a collaborative medium, it’s its own way of telling stories. It’s writing and art that come together to make a way of communicating a narrative that is different from anything else. Sometimes, that story is best suited to the form in which it was first birthed. And even if it all goes wrong, at least we still have the comics.But people are undeniably excited about a Sandman TV show.

It is not mentioned when the smartphone will come to Europe, though it will likely be around the same time as the US.A spokesperson for Samsung refused to confirm further details when contacted by\u0026nbspThe Independent.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldThe Galaxy Fold marks a major departure from the slab-like design of smartphones that has become standard over the last decade.Other smartphone makers have been developing foldable phones, including the world\u0027s second largest smartphone maker Huawei.\u0026nbspThe Chinese manufacturer was also forced to delay the launch of the Mate Flex due to similar concerns about its design.One of the main issues with the new design is with the integrated hinge and flexible screen that needs to survive thousands of folds within the typical life  of a phone without showing signs of wear.In order to address these issues, Samsung said in July that it had added additional reinforcements to the top and bottom of the hinge area, as well as extending a protective layer placed over the screen.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So they go to wealthy people so they can have a holiday boat, only used for a couple of weeks a year,” Mr Holder said.“This is gentrifying the canal and destroying our community.”CTR spokesman Matthew Symonds says the body revoked 17 licences last year and only does so as a last resort when owners fail to comply with its guidelines.Canal and River Trust\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though the government has ruled out even a technical extension during talks in Brussels, one option open to\u0026nbspthe opposition is to use legislation to force the prime minister to ask for a delay.\u0026nbspSo how likely would EU leaders be to grant an extension?\u0026nbspThis is uncertain: it can only be decided by the EU’s 27 remaining leaders. The last time Article 50 was extended to set the current deadline, the debate went well into the night and leaders had different views.But we do have a few clues...Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator heads to Brussels for talksJeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders agree no-deal planTwo in five remainers ‘would be upset if child married leave voter’Last time, EU officials said the bloc would only agree to provide time for an extension for the UK to hold a general election, to hold a second referendum, or for a political process to work out a position that parliament could accept.It was the last of these options –\u0026nbspwhich came in the form of the indicative votes in parliament –\u0026nbspthat appeared to carry the day. These were ultimately inconclusive.Would EU leaders grant one again? Probably not for a similarly nebulous political process.\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, since said that he would support an extension for either a referendum or general election. That’s a narrowing of the three options presented last time.“There’s very much a strong view across the European Union that there shouldn’t be any more extensions. While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues, quite frankly, have lost patience with the UK – and there’s enormous hostility to any further extension,” Mr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of a summit in June.“So I think an extension could really only happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK, or even something like a second referendum, if they decided to have one. What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar is one of the most pro-extension leaders. Perhaps he’s bluffing, but it certainly seems unlikely that EU leaders would refuse to give the UK more time to carry out either of those things.But one problem is that the opposition MPs who want to stop a no deal with legislation –\u0026nbsprather than a vote of no confidence to bring down the government –\u0026nbspwould not necessarily be triggering an election.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Varadkar of course\u0026nbspsaid EU leaders are losing patience with the UK – and that was months ago.In summary, an extension would be granted merely to avoid no deal would be far from certain. There is an undeniably correct recognition in some EU capitals that this simply kicks the can down the road. If that bid to stop no deal came with an election or referendum, however, they would be more likely to approve a further delay.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Marquez had led the FARC’s negotiating team with Mr Santrich also at the table.Now, just three years on, they were dressed in green coveralls and armed with automatic rifles in what appeared to be a new jungle camp somewhere in the Amazon rainforest.The country’s peace process has already faced a number of significant setbacks and still has fierce opposition from many who despise it, but the declaration is perhaps its biggest test yet.Analysts say it could go one of two ways: provide a much-needed strengthening of a fragile peace process, or jeopardise it, sending the country hurtling back towards war.Marquez(C) and fugitive rebel colleague, Jesus Santrich, of the dissolved FARC rebel army group in Colombia, on an undisclosed location of Colombia announcing that they are taking up arms again along with other guerrillas who have distanced themselves from a peace accord signed with the government in 2016 (AFPGetty Images)In the video Mr\u0026nbspMarquez, flanked by twenty other armed men, snapped back into his former Marxist rhetoric as if he had never flirted with civilian life.“This is the continuation of the rebel fight in answer to the betrayal of the state of the Havana peace accords,” he said in a 32-minute video in which he blamed the government for not having kept its end of the peace deal.“We were never beaten or defeated ideologically, so the struggle continues.”International proxy war played out in concerts on Venezuela borderThe deal was internationally lauded for formally ending a 52-year war which killed over 260,000 and displaced 7 million as the FARC, paramilitaries and the national army fought each other bitterly for control of territory.But it has been fraught with setbacks.Social leaders voicing their support of the accord are being killed at a shocking rate - 627 seven local activists since the deal was signed, according to local NGO Indepaz.The pledges the government made to develop neglected regions of the country remain little more than pledges, encouraging dissident rebels to abandon the process and return to warfare.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

the second largest guerrilla insurgency after the FARC - which has grown in recent years owing to the power vacuum left by the FARC and a safe haven in neighbouring Venezuela.Life inside the reintegration camps for ex-Farc rebels in ColombiaIn January, the Colombian government said the ELN was responsible for the capital’s worst terrorist attack in decades when a car bomb killed 22 at a police station.Although not a “death blow” to the peace process, the move could weaken it by giving its opponents “a new line of attack,\u0027\u0027 Adam Isaacson, Director at human rights advocacy group, The Washington Office on Latin America, told The Independent.With the potential to accelerate the rate at which ex-guerrillas continue to lose faith in a faltering peace process and return to arms, it “could turn into a major security problem for Colombia,\u0027\u0027 he added.Ex-FARC guerrillas at a zone dedicated to reincorporating former combatants into civilian life told The Independent that announcement caused “worry” the country could return to war, but crucially, that they had no plans to renege on their pledges.“Us ex-combatants, the fathers, mothers, and children who inhabit this space of 315 inhabitants…here we are, and here we will stay,” said Alexander Parra, representative of the Mariana Paez reincorporation zone in the Meta region.Some 7,000 rebels put down their guns as part of the accord as the FARC transitioned from communist insurgency to peaceful political party.Rodrigo Londoño, alias Timochenko, and FARC’s leader, distanced the party from the new rebels and played down their significance.“It’s an unfortunate development, but at the same time it leaves things clearer and ends the ambiguity because we had been facing a complex situation for some time,” he said, alluding to a welcome clarity of those who had chosen the path of legality and those who had not.ETCR in Spanish), where former FARC guerrilla fighters receive training to allow their adaptation to civilian life at Agua Bonita, municipality of Montanita, Caqueta Department, Colombia (RAUL ARBOLEDAAFPGetty Image)The robust response from the public and key political figures denouncing the development and voicing support of the agreement may have counterintuitively reinforced the peace process, said Sergio Guzman, Director of Colombia Risk Analysis.But the real impact will become clear in the coming days as the government decides its next move, and others are not so optimistic.Former Farc rebels using their jungle knowledge to become tour guidesAn animated President Duque, speaking from the presidential palace pledged to impose the “full weight of the law on the new “narco-terrorist gang”, create a new unit dedicated to pursuing them, and reward £725,000 for the head of each commander who appeared in the video.But although Duque reiterated support for the peace process – the majority of his party would like to see it torn up.This gifts them an opportune moment to return the country to war, said Sandra Borda, political analyst and associate professor at Los Andes University in Bogotá.“This could be a strong wake-up call to the government… does it want its main achievement to be having ended the prospect of peace?” she said.“If they don’t commit to it, if they don’t realise the best response is committing to peace process, the potential that this becomes the beginning another conflict is very high.\u0027\u0027“I am not optimistic at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Spot the signs of forced prostitution:Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection.

Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitationSome workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – butLabour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door.

When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery – “We had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing” – she faced a major backlash.These conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may\u0026nbspor may not be\u0026nbspmore racist than\u0026nbspsome of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.“In the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,” says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. “There is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\u0026nbspToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered – their killings frequently watched by large crowds – between between 1877 and 1950.\u0026nbspWreckage of last ship used to bring slaves to America found in Alabama“It is hard history, and it’s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves – you know, freedom and justice for all,” says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.“I think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us – long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We’re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.”She adds: “Coming to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals\u0026nbspis profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.”Among Swarns’ revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.Earlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit\u0026nbspthe descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution’s debts.Swarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America’s story.Carol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially\u0026nbspended slavery.Each time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response – the so-called Southern Strategy and the “war on drugs”, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.Anderson tells The Independent the US is currently ided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.Why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?Cory Booker gets 12 co-sponsors on slavery reparations billModern slavery victims ‘sent back to addresses where they were abused’Cambridge slavery inquiry will show we have plenty to feel guilty forSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.Newt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: “The New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan ‘All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with’.”Burr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America’s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.“The reason people don’t want to talk about slavery is that they don’t want to dig up the past. They don’t want to take responsibility,” she says.\u0026nbsp“All aspects of what happened to those original Africans, and what happened afterwards, should be discovered and analysed. Not enough people can be told about the 400th anniversary, not enough speeches can happen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

But, the\u0026nbspsad truth is there\u0027s become an over-reliance on using pre-existing material to either find the\u0026nbspnext big franchise or to capitalise on the success of a bestseller. It\u0027s fair enough – these\u0026nbspadaptations will always be guaranteed large box office takings thanks to the book\u0027s readers\u0026nbspmerely\u0026nbspshowing up\u0026nbspto see\u0026nbsphow the film has translated certain parts to the screen.While there are solid examples of successful big-screen adaptations – The Lord of the Rings,\u0026nbspstray\u0026nbspHarry Potter films, Gone Girl – there have more than likely been a larger number of botch jobs. Nothing is more disappointing than seeing a film version of your favourite book and realising minutes\u0026nbspin that the director\u0026nbsphas misjudged the novel\u0027s spirit or two actors have been cast in the wrong roles and\u0026nbsphave no chemistry whatsoever.This week sees the release of A Million Little Pieces, an addiction drama from Sam Taylor-Wood that follows\u0026nbspan alcoholic and drug abuser\u0027s rehabilitation. Aaron\u0026nbspTaylor-Johnson plays the lead role. it\u0027s based on the semi-fictional book\u0026nbspby James Frey – the author who originally presented the novel as a memoir before it was later\u0026nbsprevealed many of\u0026nbspits events hadn\u0027t happened. The film\u0027s reviews have been middling, with many questioning why the book was adapted in the first place. Maybe these writers should merely take inspiration\u0026nbspand create their own original stories?Below, we rank the 25 books that should have been left alone and never made into films. Click through the gallery to see what made the list.Created with Sketch.25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

It killed more than , people when it struck New Orleans, Louisiana, and the neighbouring states in late August .It was the single most catastrophic natural disaster in US history, causing damage estimated at billion.North America is currently gripped with Hurricane Dorian - a category  hurricane with winds of up to mph.It began as a tropical storm but has since progressed into a powerful hurricane - depending on its location and strength, a tropical storm is referred to as a hurricane, typhoon, cyclone or simply a tropical storm.High winds of the CAT  hurricane are now sweeping through the islands of Abaco in the Bahamas.Forecasters say Dorian will threaten the Florida peninsula late Monday or early Tuesday with Trump branding the storm a monster.Millions of people in Florida, along with the states Walt Disney World and President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort, are in the potential cross hairs of the hurricane.Dorian is the fth in s Atlantic hurricane season and is set to blast through four US states.Hundreds of flights in the Caribbean, US and Bahamas have been cancelled and several airports are closed.Hurricanes form when the ocean is warm. In the Atlantic this means the summer and autumn.In September , Hurricane Florence triggered a state of emergency in three US states as it hurtled towards the east coast.Meteorologists class the Atlantic hurricane season as running from June  to November , although intense storms can happen outside these dates.An average Atlantic hurricane season produces  named storms, of which six become hurricanes and three major hurricanes.Some scientists have blamed the series of intense storms in  on the absence of the El Niño weather phenomenon in the Pacic.Typhoon season is an ongoing event, although most tropical cyclones develop between May and October."},{"url":null,"title":"remainers mp office rees moggs home parliament suspension","story":"Pro-EU voters are furious after Boris Johnson asked the Queen to suspend the Commons in the run-up to Brexit.This daring move will hobble Remainer efforts to stop a No Deal exit from the European Union on October .In response, an ex-Labour councillor candidate Howard Simpson tweeted out Mr Mogg’s home address demanding people turn up to protest.Mr Simpson later deleted his tweet, but not before hed told thousands to show up at the Brexiteer’s village in Somerset to demonstrate.Police have confirmed they were braced for a large demo outside the Commons Leader’s house this evening.As MPs geared up for a huge Brexit battle next week:And in extraordinary scenes today, Tory MP Alex Chalk, who actually voted Remain in the referendum, was forced to face down an angry mob outside his Cheltenham office.In a video clip, Mr Chalk – who is the Private Secretary to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - attempted to calm down his constituents telling that the move to suspend Parliament sent out the “wrong” message.And when the MP joked: “What can you do, bring down the government ”, the crowd cheered loudly.This comes as backers of the Jeremy Corbyns grassroots group Momentum urged to “occupy bridges and blockade roads” to protest Boris plan to shut down Parliament.And they called for “Stop The Coup” protests in major cities across Britain for Saturday – followed by a mass demonstration on Tuesday in London to coincide with theof MPs to Westminster.Momentum national coordinator Laura Parker, who said she would occupy Parliamentshe had to, stormed: Real power doesn’t sit with the Queen or in Parliament. It’s with us the people – and that’s why we need to take action.Our message to Johnson is this:you steal our democracy, well shut down the streets.But Tories reacted with fury to Momentums ludicrous plan.David TC Davies told The Sun: Momentum seem to think that no one should do anything without their permission - and theyre going to block the streetsthey dont get their way.And its ironic that they are complaining about Parliament being shut down while they are stopping anyone from getting there at all.Another MP added: “They appear to be trying to ‘Stop the Coup’ as they put it by launching one of their own.”A former Labour MP – Tom Blenkinsop – tweeted that Momentum was “playing into the hands of the right” with their fury.It comes after thousands of people turned up to protest outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament last night.Spontaneous protests are being planned in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield too.Earlier today Mr Rees-Mogg urged teeth-gnashing Remainers to change the law or boot the Government out -they can.The Commons leader led the Government fightback today against pro-EU MPs who have vowed to stop Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament next month.Mr Rees-Mogg told them to bring it on - and that the Government was ready.He told the BBC this morning: All these people who are wailing and gnashing of teeth know that there are two ways of doing what they want to do.One, is to change the government and the other is to change the law. If they do either of those, that will then have an effect.If they dont have either the courage or the gumption to do either of those then we will leave on the st of October in accordance with the referendum result.And he added: No party should be afraid of the British people.If they have a vote of confidence, lets seethey can win it.He said the outrage over shutting down Parliament was phoney and blasted Speaker Bercow for his insistent.The teasing came as he said that Mr Corbyn doesnt have enough mates to win such a vote.Nobody wants him to be PM, he joked, labelling those who are trying to thwart Brexit as spewing out phoney outrage because they want to stop us from leaving.They are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result, he blasted.Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed to Sky News today that Labour would apply for an emergency debate next week, and would seek to force Boris to get another Brexit extension.Yesterday Boris asked the Queen for her approval to suspend proceedings for nearly five weeks from as early as September  - and she accepted.Under the extraordinary move, the PM will be able to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday, September  and no later than Thursday, September ."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew must not duck epstein questions","story":"While the rest of the Royal Family go out of their way to be polite and pleasant to us mere peasants, he appeared to take great joy in making me feel uncomfortable. Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious. Questions were asked when Andrew sold his run-down “Southyork” mansion to a Kazakh oligarch in  for millions over the asking price.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Ian-Duncan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentIAIN DUNCAN SMITH Corbyns hate mob are the ones staging a coup with anti-Brexit marches \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS Emmanuel Macron is now bending as European fears about No Deal grow \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Jeremy Corbyn and panic-stricken Remainers are now resorting to blatant lies \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Boris Johnsons brightness is a welcome sight after three years of gloom \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-james-forsyth.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJAMES FORSYTH Its rogue ones vs. prorogue ones as MPs fight to seize control of Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Karen-Brady.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentKARREN BRADY Real friends, not screen friends, are the key to keeping your kids happy Again, he denied any wrongdoing and the scandal went away. That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons. I’m sure none of the mockers have ever actually met a male ballet dancer.Those fellas are as tough as nails.They can beat a bully into a pulp with one flick of their sinewy wrists. They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And higher winds than Matthew. And heavier rain than Matthew.Just be ready for that. We’re in a position where you’re talking three, four, five days in advance of what you have to be ready for.“The threat is real from the Treasure Coast throughout the Florida peninsula. The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.The hurricane has slowed down since Thursday as it was originally expected to make landfall by Sunday.The NHC still warned Florida residents to say on alert.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Floridians left supermarket shelves empty after grabbing water, bread and canned goods in the event power and water are cut off.At a Publix supermarket in Cocoa Beach, Ed Ciecirski of the customer service department said the pharmacy was extra busy with people rushing to fill prescriptions.The grocery was rationing bottled water and had run out of dry ice.Homeowners and businesses rushed to cover their windows with plywood.Tfany Miranda of Miami Springs, Florida said: I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened.What’s the use of going all the way to Georgiait can land there You never know with these hurricanes. It could be good, it could be bad. You just have to be prepared.Jeremy Kichler, a University of Georgia extension agent in Colquitt County who works with local farmers, told local news: A lot of folks are still recovering from Irma two years ago and Michael last year.I don’t knowwe can stand another one.Ron DeSantis, the governor, said the Florida Highway Patrol would begin escorting fuel trucks to help them get past the lines of waiting motorists and replenish gas stations.On Friday, the National Hurricane Center said Dorian had just reached extremely dangerous Category  status with winds already clocking  mph .The first mandatory evacuation orders were carried out this morning.Residents in Bred County have been told to start leaving at am on Sunday The Weather Channel reports.Coastal areas could get  to  inchesof rain, with  inchesin some places, triggering le-threatening flash floods, the hurricane center said.FEMA official Jeff Byard said Dorian is likely to create a lot of havoc for roads, power and other infrastructure.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane force winds away from land, to a landfall anywhere in this zone.Friday-Next Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard, but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod, before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by next weekend.The US President said his prized Mar-a-Lago estate is in the path of the potentially deadly storm, which is expected to be extremely destructive.When asked how concerned he was about the hurricane threat to his resort, Trump said: “It would look like Mar-a-Lago is dead center but look Mar-a-Lago can handle itself.“Thats a very powerful place.He added: The thing Im worried about is the state of Florida because ... this could be a record-setting hurricane.“Now maybe things change. Were hoping for one element that might happen and thats that it makes a right turn and goes up north just prior to or equal to hitting shore.“That would be great, but thats a pretty small percentage at this point.Hurricanes have always been a part of Mar-a-Lago.In , Trump said he received a  million insurance payment for hurricane damage to the resort.Disney World is also on alert as Hurricane Dorian barrels across the Atlantic Ocean towards Florida.A spokesman said the Orlando resort is “operating under normal conditions” but they are “closely monitoring the path of the projected weather”.The resort has cancelled weekend sporting events and closing Disney’s Blizzard Beach Water Park on Sunday.They are also contacting guests with current and upcoming reservations at a number of campgrounds, cabins and villas.Jessica Armesto and her one-year-old daughter, Mila, had planned to have breakfast with Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy at Disney World.Instead, Armesto decided to take shelter at her mothers hurricane-resistant house in Miami with its kitchen full of non-perishable foods.It felt like it was better to be safe than sorry, so we cancelled our plans, she said.As Dorian closed in, the storm upended peoples Labor Day weekend plans.Major airlines began allowing travellers to change their reservations without a fee.The big cruise lines began rerouting their ships.The Bahamas is also under threat, with canned food and bottled water disappearing quickly and the sound of hammering echoed across the islands as people boarded up their homes.Dorian was expected to hit by Sunday with the potential for le-threatening storm surge that could raise water levels  feet above normal.Do not be foolish and try to brave out this hurricane, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.The price you may pay for not evacuating is your le.In Florida, the governor urged nursing homes to take precautions to prevent tragedies like the one during Hurricane Irma two years ago.That storm knocked out the air conditioning at a facility in Hollywood and  patients died in the sweltering heat.Four employees of the home were charged with manslaughter earlier this week.DeSantis said the timely message from those arrests is: Its your responsibility to make sure you have a plan in place to protect those folks.At NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA moved a -foot-high mobile launch  to the safety of the colossal Vehicle Assembly Building, built to withstand  mphwind.The launcher is for the mega rocket that NASA is developing to take astronauts to the moon.The hurricane season typically peaks between mid-August and late October.One of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US was on Labor Day in ."},{"url":null,"title":"viking sun ship london worlds longest cruise 245 days","story":"The Viking Sun ship is docked on the River Thames in Greenwich and will embark on the longest passenger sea crossing in history this weekend, spanning six continents,  countries and  ports.Over eight months, the voyage from London will aim to set a Guinness world record for the longest continuous passenger cruise.With stops including the southern-most tip of South America to the vibrant Indian city of Mumbai, it is sure to tick off plenty of bucket-list adventures.And  passengers,  including four from the UK, have reportedly signed up for the full  days.The voyagers can expect toto London on May  of .But circumnavigating the globe on board the -guest cruise liner does not come cheap -

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.The Duke was last pictured with Epstein in New York in  after the hedge fund manager had been released from prison and was a registered sex offender.He was infamously pictured with his arm around Virginia Roberts at Ms Maxwells home in London in .The alleged sex slave once again spoke out about the Duke this week in which she said Andrew should come clean about their alleged encounters.This comes as The Sun revealed that Andrew has flown home from a golf holiday for crisis talks with royal advisers.His former we and current companion Sarah Ferguson was also on the private jet flight from Spain as she continues to stand by the Duke of York.The couple feared that staying on holiday in the light of daily revelations relating to the prince’s relationship with Epstein was becoming a bad look."},{"url":null,"title":"tory mps plot remove john bercow","story":"They are furious that he appears to have taken sides in the row over the decision to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament.Mr Bercow interrupted his luxury holiday in a four-star hotel in Turkey to issue a statement branding the move a “constitutional outrage”.He said: “However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country.”Mr Bercow also accused the PM of undermining his democratic credentials.“If he wants to make these sorts of comments, then he should come back to the back benches, rather than abuse the office of Speaker.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour warned it would be a full-blown attack on our constitution adding: Boris Johnson has shown his contempt for our democracy and the British people. And Tory MP Guto Bebb branded the comments a disgrace to our democracy. MPs will table a law against no-deal on Tuesday, and try to rush it through the Commons and Lords before Parliament is suspended in around  daysapos time. But reports have suggested the Tory government could take extreme steps to stop it, like refusing to grant the Bill Royal Assent. And today, Cabinet Office minister Mr Gove - who is in charge of no-deal planning - failed to give a straight answer when asked four timesthe government would abide by the law. The first time, he told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Letaposs see what the legislation says. You’re asking me about a pig in a poke. And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.  The second time he was asked, he repeated: We will see what the legislation says when it is put forward. For me the most important thing is to bear in mind actually, we already have legislation in place which an overwhelming majority of MPs voted for. We already have an EU Withdrawal Act, we already have the notice on Article  , the process by which we leave the EU.    What [ Labour Brexit chief] Keir Starmer is trying to do now is to say you know the British people I said we would leave, I said in my manesto we would leave, but now I actually think we wonapost leave. That is a denial of democracy. Asked a third time what will happenMr Starmer passes a law that blocks no-deal, he said: I don’t believe Keir Starmer will get legislation through to that effect. Asked a fourth time, he said: Letaposs see what the legislation is that he puts forward. I canapost comment on a Bill that Keir Starmer, for entirely understandable reasons, hasnapost yet published. Mr Goveaposs comments - branded simply astonishing by UCLaposs Constitution Unit - prompted swt fury. Tory MP Guto Bebb said Mr Goveaposs comments were a disgrace to our democracy, adding: Not only are they suspending Parliament to try and force through a disastrous no-deal, but now they are suggesting that, evenParliament passed a law requiring the Government to avoid no-deal, they might simply ignore it. Our very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his Government.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: For ministers not to confirm that this Government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking. The Prime Minister must make a statement on this straightaway. No Government is above the law. Labouraposs deputy leader Tom Watson said: A powerful government representative refusing to confirm they’ll obey the legislative will of Parliament. Think about that for a moment. This is the UK. The correct answer is aposwe will always obey the will of Parliamentapos. Jon Trickett, Labouraposs Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said: Boris Johnson has shown his contempt for our democracy and the British people. Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.  It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the No Deal Brexit the government is attempting to ram through will hit people’s living standards with increased food prices. This is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it won’t be him and his wealthy friends paying it – but ordinary families already struggling after  years of austerity. It is the people, not an unelected Prime Minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our country’s future. Labour MP Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, said: It’s a very simple question so how can there be any doubt about the answer  The Government must abide by any legislation that is passed by Parliament.  Legal commentator David Allen Green noted drily: In which Michael Gove , a former Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, will not commit the government to complying with the rule of law. It comes after pro-EU Tory MPs hurled themselves into war with Boris Johnson by facing down his threat to cast them out of the party this week.  The Prime Minister is considering yanking away the Tory whip from more than a dozen rebelsthey vote to block no-deal Brexit on Thursday. But ringleader MP David Gauke today dared the PM to dump him - saying heaposs ready to become an independent in the national interest. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond said suspending the whip would be staggeringly hypocritical because  members of the current cabinet have defied the party whip this year.  The Prime Minister, who has a majority of one, faces defeatthe MPs can pass the law in the tiny period of time before he suspends Parliament for five weeks, from around September . Tens of thousands took to streets across Britain yesterday to demand Mr Johnson stop the the month-long shutdown coup. But any Tory MP who sides with opposition MPs and votes against no-deal could have the whip withdrawn, be suspended, and replaced with a Johnson loyalist candidate at the next election. Mr Johnson refused to rule out the aposnuclear optionapos, telling the Sunday Times: I just say to everybody in the country, including everyone in parliament, the fundamental choice is this.

But he was then shown a clip of himself, less than three months ago, speaking out against the idea of proroguing Parliament.At the time Mr Gove said: I don’t think that is the right thing to do. I think that we live in a parliamentary democracy. He added in June: We are a parliamentary democracy. And suspending or as the Constitutional experts call it, proroguing parliament in order to try to get no deal through I think would be wrong. Later he went even further, saying on June : I will defend our democracy. And you cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of Parliament.Yet quizzed by the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show today, the Cabinet Office minister - who is in charge of no-deal Brexit planning - brazenly insisted he had not performed a U-turn.   He said he was talking in June about proroguing Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. Itaposs true that Boris Johnson insists his suspension is nothing to do with forcing through no-deal, and Parliament willon October . Yet the Prime Ministeraposs decision will massively curtail the amount of time MPs have to debate or stop no-deal. And Labouraposs John McDonnell said it is insulting the intelligence of the British people to pretend the month-long shutdown is about anything  other than closing down Brexit debate. Mr Gove was played the clip of his own comments by the BBC show. He replied: The question did actually mention October, because it was in the context of a debate that was happening during the leadership election.  And there was an idea going round at that time which you put to me which was that parliament shouldn’t sit at all during October, that it shouldn’t sit at all before we left on the st of October. And I specically said that I thought that would be wrong. And that is not what is happening now. He added there is a huge dference and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise.The interviewer back on June  - who was also Mr Marr - said: What do you say to your colleagues who say well there’s an obvious answer to this problem. Don’t let parliament sit in October. Then we get out, parliament can’t stop us getting out, we prorogue. What about that  Dominic Raab suggested that, Esther McVey was saying the same thing on this programme.   MPs will table a law on Tuesday to stop Boris Johnson crashing the UK out of the EU on October  without a deal.

Dad is a filmmaker and mum is an acupuncturist and painter. It was while I was on summer break from boarding school that I first met Laura Albert – the girlfriendof my older brother Geoff, at a family dinner. Laura was a former punk who made a living having phone sex and like no one  I’d ever met. I loved her instantly, but I had no idea she was about to change my le. She was always coming out with witty, outrageous things that would shock everyone and you never knew which character she would decide to be at any time. I was fascinated, especially when Geoff told me she’d written novels in the guise of a fictional troubled young man called JTLeRoy, the son of a truck stop hooker.    They told the story of his traumatic childhood, drug abuse and le on the streets as a teenage prostitute. When I read them, I thought they were beautul, and raw. I could understand why JT had become a literary sensation with celebrity followers like Bono, Marilyn Manson, Madonna,and Courtney Love. I had no idea what I wanted to do after school, but I‘d decided not to go to college and was waitressing. I needed to take time to figure out who I was. I‘d known since puberty I was queer, but my late teens were really confusing. Now I describe myself as gender fluid, but that language didn’t exist back then.    I spent a lot of time with Geoff and Laura, who had a band and invited me to sing with them. At that time, every cool magazine wanted interviews with the mysterious and reclusive JT – who no one had ever seen – and Laura did them all on email or by phone, impersonating him with southern drawl. But when one magazine said they needed photos of JT for the interview, she asked me a favour. ‘Listen, I need you to be JT, but just once OK ’ she said. I was nervous, but I thought, ‘Why not ’ It felt exhilarating as I bound up my breasts, put on cargo pants, a black T-shirt and disguised myself in a blonde Halloween wig and sunglasses. I was also wearing JT’s trademark raccoon penis bone necklace Laura had given me. Laura had invented this character called Speedie for herself, a loud Cockney, who was JT’s manager and accompanied him everywhere. Laura wore a red wig and did most of the talking on the shoot. I said as little as possible.  We both thought it was just going to be a one-off, but when I said yes to that shoot it was almost like a contract. So when Laura asked me to be JT again, I thought, ‘I’m already there, so why not carry on ’ And it gave me a rush trying on someone ’s sense of self. JT began to consume me. Over the next six years we travelled the world doing book tours, press conferences and meeting stars like Carrie Fisher, who invited JT to stay at her house in LA. She was so warm and generous, gave me some of her clothes and advised me get a financial adviser. Whenever I met a ‘celebrity fan’ I couldn’t process it. I first met Courtney Love at a book reading she’s amazing and so open. In New York I met Winona Ryder at another book event and we ended up going to see a play together – she was just lovely. In interviews, people wanted to know why I wore a wig and glasses. And I told them I wanted to keep something for me.  One time though a reporter asked me directly, ‘How do we know you’re who you say you are, you sound like a woman…’ I took a deep breath and said, ‘I could be anybody. As for sounding like a woman – thank you.’ Then I curtsied! But it was all becoming a bit blurry and confusing. When JT met the Italian actress Asia Argento in Rome to discuss movie rights to his second book, things got strange. JT and Asia got into a physical relationship and while Asia was attracted to him, I was attracted to her as Savannah. I think there was a real connection between us. I bound up my breasts and told her JT had been taking hormones for years and he’d had a sex change. I don’t think she believed me… but I was always amazed at what people would accept from JT. I went on set in Tennessee when a movie was made of JT’s first book. JT fans Winona and Marilyn Manson appeared in it.  But afterwards I told Laura I wanted to quit. She persuaded me to be him one last time for the movie premiere in Cannes. A while after I got back, a journalist on The New York Times rang. He called me Savannah and said he had pictures of me without the disguise and had showed them to people I knew, and that they all said it was JT. He told me we were going to be exposed. It was over. It was a relief, because I’d wondered how I’d get myself out of this. Laura and I didn’t really see each other afterwards, it was like a relationship break- up, although we’ve emailed occasionally. I started my own clothing line, became an artist and moved to New York. A few years after it happened I wrote a memoir which has just been made into a movie – J.T LeRoy. It was a dream when Kristen Stewart agreed to play me. When we were on set together I could feel her absorbing my mannerisms, she’s really got me down.

You have helped raise nearly £, – enough to start treatment for tiny Theo Hutton, who was revived seven minutes after being stillborn. This month parents Laura and Andy will take the tot, who has cerebral palsy, to Panama for stem surgery. They hope it will be the first of five such treatments aimed at massively enhancing the quality of their happy -month-old son’s le. The couple want to raise £, for Theo. Laura, , said: “The fact that people we don’t know have seen the story and donated is just amazing.  “We can’t thank them enough. Now our focus is to keep going so we can take him back for a second course in seven or eight months time.” The pioneering stem cell surgery, not currently available on the NHS, has led to huge improvements in other children who suffer from the incurable and ­crippling condition. Theo’s brain was starved of oxygen in the course of the dficult birth and he is unable to sit, walk or talk. Laura and Andy were told Theo was a blue baby and he was immediately whisked away. They described it as every “parent’s worst nightmare”.  After they watched him being ­resuscitated the tot was placed on le-support, ­attached to numerous wires and tubes, while his parents were told he might not make it. Laura cried when she could finally hold Theo for the first time. He was five days old. After they finally took him home they soon realised he wasn’t developing at the same rate as other babies. At  months he was ­diagnosed with cerebral palsy – a condition which affects one in  UK tots. Laura said the treatment in Panama aims to stimulate stem cell growth in the brain.  She said: “He will have five stem cell treatments via IV drips. One a day for five days. We are hopeful that it will help him. Every small step for Theo is a massive step for us.” The procedure would see  ­millions stem cells from a donor umbilical cord injected into Theo’s system to stimulate and repair damaged nervous tissue in the brain. Laura and Andy, , hope to take him to the Stem Cell Institute in Panama City once a year for the next five years. Each course of treatment will cost about £, but the couple say it could improve the youngster’s le hugely, helping him achieve milestones they can only dream of at the moment. Laura, a health and safety manager from Wirral, Merseyside, said: “Around  per cent of your brain is ­developed by the time you are five so, hopefully, we can get the first three treatments in by then so they would have the most benefit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit womans horror beast who","story":"NewsBrit womans horror as beast who raped her at Kavos resort freed  years earlyEXCLUSIVE: Kayleigh Morgan was subjected to a -hour ordeal by Dimitris Aspiotis, known as The Beast of Kavos - named after the party resort on the Greek island of Corfu where he pouncedShareByPatrick Hill:,  AUG NewsKayleigh Morgan was subjected to a -hour ordeal by Dimitris Aspiotis\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Duchess is said to be a huge fan of Ibiza, and celebrated her th birthday at a luxurious villa on the island with Prince Harry earlier this year. Boasting seven-bedrooms, a gym, a jacuzzi and its own  metre infinity pool - the sprawling pad is said to have cost £, a week to rent.    The villa lies close to the picturesque village of Es Cubells on the south-western coast of Ibiza.

We can reveal the Northern Ireland minister, son of Conservative Party grandee Douglas Hurd, appears with ex-we Kim in a copy of the depraved financier’s contacts published online. Old Etonian Mr Hurd last night ­denied ever meeting Epstein, who was a friend of Prince Andrew and killed himself in jail last month, aged . It is believed the Hurds’ contact ­details were passed to the billionaire by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, . She is the daughter of the disgraced late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell and an “old friend” of Kim’s from ­university. Maxwell is accused of being Epstein’s “madam” which she has denied. The address book ­features two previous home ­addresses, along with five telephone numbers for Mr Hurd. It also lists a personal email for the -year-old, who orced Kim in .  Asked why the ­contact details were in the book, Mr Hurd said he had not consented to their inclusion, adding: “I never met with or spoke to Jeffrey Epstein.” Kim also denied ever meeting Epstein but said: “Ghislaine Maxwell is an old friend from university days.” Mr Hurd was Minister of State for Industry and Climate Change in Theresa May’s regime from July  to June  at the newly created Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. He was then Minister of State for Policing and the Fire Service, ­quitting this July for the Ulster post. Mr Hurd has also served as Minister for London since November . Before becoming the MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner in , he worked for a British bank based in Brazil. It is believed Epstein acquired the contact details around the time Mr Hurd set up the Small Business Network, which he started in  to advise the Conservative Party on business policy. The revelation came as images emerged of former Labour spin doctor Lord Mandelson – another pal of Maxwell and also listed in Epstein’s contact book – holidaying with the ­disgraced financier on St Barts in the Caribbean. The shot were taken in , just six months before Epstein was ­arrested for having sex with a minor.     It was claimed yesterday that Maxwell could face raps as investigators close in on the women who allegedly helped Epstein systematically abuse girls. US federal authorities are preparing possible charges that include sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy against people who arranged Epstein’s alleged crimes, two sources close to the probe told The New York Times. So far, no Epstein associates have been charged or named as co-conspirators. But Maxwell, who denies any wrongdoing, and others have been accused in private lawsuits of recruiting, training and maintaining a network of teenage girls that Epstein used for sex. The Duke of York, who faces growing pressure to reveal what he knew, has said that on no occasion did he “see, witness or suspect” any inappropriate behaviour by Epstein."},{"url":null,"title":"king george vi told wish","story":"NewsKing George VI was told to wish Adolf Hitler happy birthday to stave off WWDeclassied Government documents show how a Cabinet meeting debated whether King George VI should send a birthday message to the Nazi leader in ShareCommentsBySteven Taylor:,  AUG NewsGerman dictator Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute in \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

British officials and politicians feared thatKing George VI ignored the occasion, Hitler would be insulted. But they also worried about exposing the monarch to criticism for appearing to cosy up to the evil regime in Berlin.

So when she launched lestyle blog, The Tig, she felt exposed as it was aposher babyapos where she expressed the real her. Andyou didn’t like it, then you probably wouldnapost like her, she said. It would be her own honest thoughts and feelings she was exposing - and not a character penned by a writer. Writing her aposyear in reviewapos on New Yearaposs Eve in , Meghan wrote: Where did this year go  I know you’re probably like me and find yourself saying that at every year’s end, but seriously - where did  go  It was just May and I was sitting with butterflies in my stomach, coercing my finger to press the send button on  Twitter .It was time for me to say that this website, this passion project, this thing called The Tig was going live. And I was petried. That may come as a surprise to you, but let’s be real for a moment. I’m an actor. I have made a career of saying other people’s words for a living and making them sound believable. Yes, we color them with nuance and add subtext to the writing, but at the end of the day I can hide behind the character.  It’s their words, their choices. The writer puts them on paper and I give them a voice. Simply speaking, I am the vehicle. But this Tig thing…that was all me. My thoughts, my words, my likes, my ethos. If you didn’t like it, then you probably didn’t like me. And Ihad to be okay with that. Although Meghan could not anticipate what reaction the now-defunct website would receive, it went on to be a huge success, with tips on fashion, beauty, travel and interviews with celebrities and chefs.    She continued in the blog post: This brainchild of mine – of inspired living and dreams coming true, of food and fashion, fancy friends, of role models that make the earth shake, and travel that leaves you absolutely breathless – it caught on. My aposlittle engine that couldapos – did. And it’s because of you. May this year bring you endless joy. I hope you take a risk, that you do something that gives you butterflies in the pit of your belly, that you live a le less stled, and that you exceed your own expectations. You absolutely can and you absolutely must.    Without question this is the happiest I have ever been – personally, professionally, wholly. You are a very large part of that, and I thank you from the bottom of my beating heart. Thank you, my friend, and cheers to a most beautul !

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

There are clever lighting and curtain effects that make the area quite attractive.We were brought a bottle of water and the cocktails, wine and food menus.Our waitress explained they had  Brewing beers on tap though there were bottles available too. My husband enjoys the likes of Peroni or Coors, but these aren’t sold here. He took a bottle of Lagunitas IPA, on our server’s recommendation, and I knee-jerked into Bacardi and diet coke as I was unsure of what  they had and a request for Kahlua had met with a blank stare. It would be goodthey perhaps did a beer and spirits menu too. vw, px\"  The drinks came and we were told the soupswere langoustine chowder and one I didn’t order .Other starters included chicken and duck liver parfait with rhubarband hot smoked salmon with pickled egg yolk . Across the table the choice was for scallops, apples and alliumsan unusual combination, we thought, but he loves scallops. The mains choices range from the £ mark, with a few vegetarian options – spelt grain and barley risotto and a courgette lasagne being two.I struggled a little bit with the menu – a lot of the dishes contained elements I just don’t like, chicken with sweetcorn ragout, duck with spiced pear, sea trout with pea veloute. I’m not sophisticated enough for this!I was on the steak option – Campbell’s Gold ribeyeor steak frites, oz flat iron steak , I chose the latter as I hadn’t had it before. My other half chose the grilled whole sea bream with rocket, orange and pine nut salad . vw, px\"  My soup was served with a poppy seeded roll – I was a little disappointed that bread hadn’t put on the table to nibble on while we waited – but my roll and soup were very nice. The chowder had lots of finely chopped veg in it.The seafood was also served in a bowl and the four quite small scallops didn’t seem to merit the price tag. However, they were cooked to perfection and the mix with the apple and alliumwas fabulous. But another couple wouldn’t have gone amiss. vw, px\"  The mains came – my steak was medium rare as requested and served on a warmed marble plate with the chips in a separate dish.My husband agreed to having his fish filleted. The server used two spoons to cut off the head and tail and get the backbone etc out. She did warn there would still be bones in it and, unfortunately, there were quite a few. I’d have found this off-putting, but he coped manfully. vw, px\"  I shared my pile of chips and steak – the chips were to die for, crispy and tasty and the steak had a lovely flavour but was a little chewy in places. I’m not familiar with the cut, so perhaps that was due to how I had it cooked.The sea bream was tasty, but I’m not sure it is something we’d order again. vw, px\"  A fellow diner had a burger deliveredand I had a severe case of food envy. It looked wonderful.The desserts were fancy ice cream and sorbet and a bruleebut we decided to go for the Scottish and French cheeses .The plate came with six pieces of cheese, oatcakes, chutney and pickled grapes. It was very pleasant and I loved the chutney, though I wouldn’t rush to eat another pickled grape!I had an espresso martiniwhile my other half – who’d swapped his beer with me – ordered himself a second Bacardi.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards.

on aggregate to Croatian side Rijeka.A - stalemate at Kilmarnock last weekend made it just four points from the opening three Premiership matches.McInnes knows the heat is on but said: “The pressure is never off Aberdeen.“There is always a pressure to win, especially at home.“I know more than most what is required here.“We need to remind folk we won the cup tie at Dundee off the back of a European tie.“Although - at Kilmarnock wasn’t good enough from my point of view and we still expect more, in isolation it isn’t the worst result in the world.”Aberdeen’s defence has been hit by three injury set-backs this week.Following scans on an injury sustained at Rugby Park it was confirmed Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna will be out for up to a month with a hamstring tear.Centre-back Ash Taylor also suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from a hamstring tear that has sidelined the summer signing since the - Europa League draw with Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia on July .Aberdeen are awaiting the results of a scan but it is feared Taylor will be ruled out for a number of weeks.The Reds will also give a late fitness test to Shaleum Logan after the right-back underwent a minor procedure on a groin problem.If Logan is unavailable McInnes will have just four defenders available for the clash with the Staggies – Andy Considine, Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin and Zak Vyner.McInnes has challenged the Dons to go into the upcoming international break buoyed by a victory.He said: “We are looking forward to the challenge of winning three points and feeling a bit better about ourselves.“We want to look at the league table and be a bit happier with that.“It is important we just concentrate on our own performance and that we bring a strong team performance.“The players will be absolutely fine this season and it is important we try to get the three points.“We know the level of performance we are capable of so it is up to us to try to find that.”Ross County suffered a heavy -

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"onboard-volunteers-dedicated-saving-scotland-39-s-dolphins-whales","story":"I head below.

But they are under threat: from noise, pollution, discarded fishing gear and even tourism. A Cuvierrsquos beaked whale stranded on Skye in  died with its belly full of plastic bags. Over a hundred of the deep-ing whales were found dead last summer in the north Atlantic, most of them in Scotland. Military sonar is a strong suspect.Entanglements in creel ropes and other equipment is a regular problem for cetaceans and seals, with a dead whale in Scrabster recently tangled in creel gear from Nova Scotia. Last but not least, marine mammals are victims of their own popularity. Tourists crowd onto boats to see them, and tour operators are under pressure to provide ever-closer encounters. Scottish Wildle Trust has called for tougher controls on tourism operations.The data from the Silurian ndash collected in , hours of volunteer work on more than  trips on the west coast ndash is crucial. The Trustrsquos science officer Lauren Hartny-Mills gives an example: having hard facts enables it and other agencies in the Scottish Entanglement Alliance to engage with fishing operators over why entanglements happen and their impacts, and come up with solutions.She says: ldquoNo entanglement is intentional and itrsquos really upsetting for the fishers who find these animals in distress in their gear, but they also lose money from cutting animals free and lost fishing time.Survey information is used to find where marine animals and fishing gear clash, and photo data collected on surveys can give clues to what injuries cetaceans suffer at the hands of man-made objects and machinery.And the data is particularly important because Government consultations are afoot for four new Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters, three off the west coast, including a , sq km one in the Sea of the Hebrides.Data from the Silurian has been key in defining that last MPA and a smaller one off the north east coast of Lewis. HWDT information on the movements of minke whales and Rissorsquos dolphins and other creatures will help the Scottish Government set the MPA rules under which fishing, tourism and development are regulated.After heading west out of Tobermory in the early morning, we face the full force of the weather as we turn south-west into the sea lane between Mull, Coll and Tiree. With me on the boat are volunteers Jenny Hampson, based on Mull, and Andy Tait, whorsquos from the north-east of England but spends much of his time on the island. The rest of the six-strong volunteer complement is made up of young undergraduates, mainly marine science students, who combine knowledge of the sea environment and its problems with an enthusiasm and delight in the wildle.Mancunian Hampson is studying for a masters in marine mammal science at St Andrews, and was a full-time volunteer for the trust for nine months. She s like an extra member of staff, knowing the routines and the rules from helping out on previous trips.As the rolling eases near the dramatic little Treshnish Isles, I head below again where shersquos at work. Information on species, direction of travel, distance and behaviour of any animal spotted is yelled down from the watch team on the mast, and she shows me how itrsquos put into a database and turned into statistics.In the rough conditions and rain itrsquos much harder to see anything on the surface, and thatrsquos where the hydrophone towed behind the boat comes into its own.Hampson explains it collects the sounds of porpoises, which are plotted into the database. It also shows up the whistles of dolphins, the snapping sounds made by shrimps, and things such as the acoustic deterrent devices which blare out sound to drive seals away from fish farms.ldquoI wanted to do this since I was about five ndash I have always been one of those whale nuts, says Hampson.Tait has been a volunteer for HWDT since it started in . On his trips hersquos seen orca, four dferent species of dolphin as well as masses of other wildle ndash hersquos good on bird identication too.ldquoI do it all because I love wildle. This is what I live for now since I retired, he says.Wersquore on only the third of a new series of winter-months surveys by Silurian. In the past she has normally sailed from April to October only, taking paying volunteers on trips of up to  days across the Hebrides, counting the mammals as they go. That has built up a wealth of data but more information is needed.This trip is paid for out of a grant from the Scottish Governmentrsquos wildle agency Scottish Natural Heritagendash HWDT will get a total of around pound, over three years year from SNH for its survey work ndash and these winter surveys are dferent, drawing on local volunteers to do similar work for shorter periods, at short notice, as weather windows allow.Volunteers go free on the three-day trips but they have to put up with the lurching winter seas, and sometimes worse: on Januaryrsquos trip they were chipping ice off the deck. More winter surveys will follow over the next two years, giving scientists the first proper picture of what west coast cetacean and seal populations are like in winter and how they behave.We turn east, and my second night aboard is spent moored in a small cove on the north side of Ulva, off the coast of Mull, whose inhabitants famously won more than pound million from the Scottish Government to buy the island and tempt people to repopulate it.From here it looks bleak and inhospitable, and we scrap a plan for a run ashore in favour of sketching, board games and chat before an early night. Some of the students sit drawing simple outlines of marine mammals, trying to capture the essence of the creatures, the movement that makes their massive forms so graceful.Everyone helps with cooking and clearing up, with Burgess and first mate Brian Condon giving a gentle guiding hand.The next day we retrace our steps, and as we turn back into the Sound of Mull, and get the stf south-west wind behind us, the engine is switched off and we come under pure sail.Four oyster catchers pass, much faster than the boat, bouncing in the wind as they dip and flit. The light, down into the sound and in towards the folded land, is shting in the heaps of mist and cloud. A rag of blue sky slips away, the brightness briefly lighting the toe of the ness ahead.On deck the volunteers are concentrating hard on the count. We have seen seals and harbour porpoise, but so far none of the larger marine mammals. However hard yoursquore looking, though, itrsquos dficult not to be distracted by the beauty around you.Burgess tells me this interplay of light and sea is what she loves. ldquoPeople ask meI get bored with just sea and sky to look at. But even when yoursquore right out at sea with no land in sight, it changes all the time ndash itrsquos fascinating.As skipper and boat manager she commands her one crew member, decides where and how we travel, looks after motley volunteers including myself, and helps ensure the vital survey work is done properly. As she steers the boat she tells me she ldquofell back into the west coast of Scotland and became skipper a year ago after working as first mate on Silurian then as a er and sailor around the world.A Mull native who studied marine biology, shersquos from a fishing family and has an ease born of years of familiarity with the boat, the sea and the whole system that keeps us alive in this alien environment. She also chips in on occasion with a reality check about people needing to make a living when volunteer enthusiasm for marine conservation bubbles over.Working the Silurian is a dferent challenge to other sailing jobs. The science comes first and that means travelling in straight lines ndash transects ndash at seven knots, so consistent counts of animals and objects can be made.ldquoWe try to cover as many dferent areas as possible that we havenrsquot done before but the weather quite often doesnrsquot let us go exactly where we want to go, Burgess says. ldquoYou also have to think about where you can anchor on the evening so people get a good nightrsquos rest so they can carry on working the next day.ldquoThen you have the tides, which also dictate where wersquore going, there are massive tidal streams around a lot of the islands. ldquoItrsquos a ever-ending puzzle of trying to work out whatrsquos going to be the most effective way of managing to survey the areas wersquore going to cover.The boat was built in Seattle in  and has led a colourful career: in the s it was picked up by the US Coastguard off the coast of Florida and impounded for smuggling cocaine from Columbia. A few years later she was used by a team filming for the first Blue Planet documentary for the BBC, before being acquired by the Trust in .Burgess says Silurianrsquos considerable weight allows the vessel to batter through much of the bad weather. A refit last year smartened her rigging up, and the combination of sails and engine means she can make the best of any weather.Our third evening is spent moored in the small bay north-west of Castle Duart on the heel of Mull towards Oban. The constant drizzle that soaked the last watch of volunteers has stopped as I step out on deck in the early evening with Becky Dudley, HWDTrsquos marine bioersity officer.We watch fascinated as the moon slides in and out of cloud, throwing silver onto flat dusk water. As we talk a common seal approaches the boat, drawing smiles and coos from the volunteers.Dudley admits to her personal devotion to whales and dolphins: it started with a cetacean-themed quilt-cover as a child. But, she says the science is what matters, and decision-making using hard data is essential: ldquoItrsquos really important for instance that the boundaries and what happens in the MPAs arenrsquot just based on guesswork. You want solid scientic data to show where the animals are, where theyrsquore not, how the populations are doing within that area and how many species are using that area.Later I ask the Trustrsquos director Alison Lomax why it is that peoplersquos unscientic, almost anthropomorphic ideas, draw them towards cetaceans.ldquoWith whales and dolphins therersquos certainly a connection that those types of animals allow you to make, she says ldquoThese animals are so mysterious, we are still learning so much about them, and yet there are so many similarities between us and them in terms of our biology and parts of our behaviour.ldquoFor me itrsquos that key moment where you get just that glimpse of a whale or a dolphin and your world and theirs meets ndash that is something that is quite inspiring, and it brings tears to some peoplersquos eyes.At Castle Duart we are up early next day for a full dayrsquos work before we head back to port. The boat chugs into Loch Linnhe, flat water welcome on the balance and legs, but itrsquos dull compared to the wave-crashing, swell-riding trip to Ulva and back. There are more seals and creels, but not much sign of cetaceans as we head up and around Lismore, then back south around Morven.Then, by the scar of the huge Glensanda quarry, therersquos a wave of excitement. Someone has spotted a common dolphin, the first of the trip after three days, gently rising with a graceful arch of the back, and sliding back below the ruffled water. Every time we think wersquove seen the last of it, it pops up again, close enough and high enough to see the distinctive cream-coloured patches on its sides.Cameras click, and it is recorded in the data base: species, behaviour, direction of travel, bearing from the boat, another small case to add to the thousands logged by the Silurian.Dudley, however, looks concerned. She plans to report the sighting to British Divers Marine Le Rescue . The animal is alone, which is unusual its calm, smooth movement is a bit too gentle for a creature often seen leaping and twisting around. There could be something amiss, and local observers from BDMLR can keep an eye out in case the animal is injured or unwell, and ends up stranded.Later she tells me therersquos been no response to her call, indicating the animal has not been spotted again or got into trouble, but itrsquos another indication of the care HWDT staff take of these animals. The survey work can be enjoyable, there can be glorious moments and exciting sightings, but working on the Silurian, and volunteering on it, is no easy task, as the seasickness taught me. That the Trust, staff and volunteers take this task on, helps not only the animals they care for but the whole marine ecosystem. Whatever drives them, wersquore better off for it.PROTECTION ndash OR JUST PAPER PARKS Four new Marine Protected Areas are proposed by the Scottish Government: the , sq km Sea of the Hebrides MPA the smaller North East Lewis and nearby Shiant East Bank MPAs and the Southern Trench MPA off the Aberdeenshire and Moray coasts.All are supposed to protect a range of animals and features, but data collected by HWDTrsquos teams will be crucial in protecting Minke whales and basking sharks in the Sea of the Hebrides, and Rissorsquos dolphins off Lewis.The Scottish Government is consulting on how they should be defined, and designation does mean some constraints on development. After that there will be y debate over ldquomanagement measures, controlling activity with the MPA areas, with the battle lines likely to be drawn between conservation campaigners and the fishing industry.The consultation document suggests a cost of poundm to the oil and gas, power transmission and fishing industries from the strictest likely control measures, although it says the benefits to the economy could be far greater.Nick Underwood of Scottish conservation charity Open Seas fears the MPAs will be designated but wonrsquot have the rules in place needed to regulate damaging activity. ldquoThese sites are already long delayed ndash there have been worrying delays in the implementation of these MPAs, he says. ldquoThese sites need to be designated as soon as possible with meaningful management. Until that management is in place these are just going to be paper parks.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoOnce designated, these sites will receive new levels of protection which mean decision makers have a legal responsibility to consider the effects of activities on the sites and features."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-help-retrofit-european-homes","story":"Millions of poorly insulated and ventilated homes across northern Europe are now too hot for summers and too cold for winters.As global heating hits, there have already been warnings, from UK Government advisers, that some of Scotlandrsquos houses may kill, because those of us who live in them will be overheated.But homes that are energy inefficient and ill-suited to the new reality of increasingly changeable weather are common throughout the continent.So scientists and engineers are increasingly trying to work out how to retrofit them.The University of Strathclyde is part of an ambitious initiative that will design state-of-the-art factories to support the renovation of  million homes across Europe that must become energy-neutral before .Supported by Interreg North Sea region , the initiative encompasses the areas of Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden that border the North Sea, currently home to around  million people.Focusing on properties built between  and  that must become more sustainable to meet EU energy and climate targets, the project aims to stimulate the European building sector, which does not currently have the necessary production facilities to support this enormous task.Named Indu-zero, the three-year project aims to industrialise housing by creating a blueprint for an autonomous factory that adopts Industry . technologies and can manufacture , refurbishment kits per year.Similar factories will then follow the blueprint across ious European countries.Placed over a house like a jacket, the refurbishment kits feature clever solutions for sustainable energy production and increased comfort of living, such as solar , heat pumps and ventilation. Signicantly reducing energy costs, they will also contribute substantially to achieving national climate change targets.The University of Strathclydersquos Space Mechatronic Systems Technology Laband Advanced Forming Research Centre , based in its Design, Manufacture  Engineering Management departmentand its Energy System Research Unit , have all joined the consortium with partners from the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and Norway.ldquoThis is a very ambitious project aiming to address the real challenge faced by millions of people living in energy inefficient homes in the North Sea region. The Universityrsquos multi-disciplinary team have blended their expertise to lead key work packages within this challenging and potentially impactful project, said Professor Xiu Yan, director of SMeSTech lab and Indu-Zero project leader.The AFRC and SMeSTech will create a blueprint of an autonomous factory using expertise in smart manufacturing and advanced digital manufacturing technologies, employing laser scanning techniques to map out renovation packages bespoke to house designs.ESRU will use simulations to assess the energy and comfort impacts of proposed renovation packages to ensure that they are fit for purpose.Indu-Zero brings together parties from dferent countries and fields of expertise. Partners come from the education sector, the construction sector, housing corporations, industry and government.Danny McMahon, senior manufacturing engineer at AFRC, said: ldquoThis is a really exciting project that could have a big impact... on achieving climate targets, reducing energy costs for home owners and boosting sustainability.

offers an insight into the extraordinary extent of the Edinburgh familyrsquos influence on Scottish le, from helping to keep those at sea a little safer, to opening river routes and harbour entrances to ease the passage of vessels, and canals and bridges.Indeed, points out Chris Fleet, Map Curator at the National Library of Scotland, while the Stevenson family may be best known for constructing every lighthouse in Scotland, the plans and designs show that element only made up around % of their work.ldquoBy far the greatest proportion of their work was far more mundane but important aspects of infrastructure like harbours, breakwaters, slipways and even railway and canal projects, he says.ldquoBut it was their initial work in early th century on the Bell Rock lighthouse that gave the family massive publicity.The long and dangerous reef lying  miles east of Dundee and on the route for vessels navigating to and from the Firths of Tay and Forth, had been a cause for concern for decades and was linked to the loss of up to six ships every winter ndash and as many as  during one particularly stormy season.However, it was the sinking of HMS York in  with the loss of all hands that sparked calls for a lighthouse to be erected on Bell Rock a daring proposal given the surface of the rock typically lies under ft of water, emerging only at low tide.Glasgow-born Robert Stevenson had already worked as an apprentice to his step-father Thomas Smith, a lamp-maker appointed by the new Northern Lighthouse Board to construct and manage four lighthouses.Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from the New Town where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of treacherous rocks around  miles south west of the island.The family firm was eventually passed to Davidrsquos sons, David Alan and Charles, in the s, and grandson, Charles.But while they continued to specialise in lighthouse design until the s ndash including lighthouses as far afield as New Zealand and Japan, the family also undertook a wide iety of work which helped transform travel and improve infrastructure.Mr Fleet points out that the maps and plans held by the Library show not only the remarkable attention to detail and vision of each designer, but in some cases the changing face of the locations such as harbours which were redesigned to make them safer and easier to navigate, rivers where work was carried out help improve the flow, and roads, bridges and canals which opened swathes of the nation to economic development.However, perhaps the biggest impact of their work is missing from the collection of maps, plans and documents: the countless lives their engineering skills saved.Mike Bullock, Chief Executive of the Northern Lighthouse Board said: ldquoFor over  years Robert Stevenson and his descendants designed and built the majority of Scotlandrsquos Lighthouses.ldquoThey constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time and the elements.ldquoYou only have to look at Robert Stevensonrsquos Bell Rock Lighthouse, which since  has been continuously safeguarding ships and the lives of their crews and passengers, to recognise their remarkable contribution to our

Carlaw, the partyrsquos deputy leader, agreed to step up on an interim basis until the contest is called.It is understood that the key issue for the Scottish Tories over the next few months will be on whether the party should either split from the UK party or become more autonomous.Davidson won the leadership in  after defeating this proposal, which had been suggested by rival Murdo Fraser.However, senior party figures believe times have changed and a majority of Tory MSPs, as well as a big majority of shadow cabinet members, are said to back a rethink of the relationship with the UK party.Fraser and Adam Tomkins, the partyrsquos shadow constitution secretary, are on the record voicing their support for a revised structure. There is no preferred model, but advocates of change are attracted to setting up a new party purely for Holyrood elections.In comments reported yesterday, Carlaw shot down the idea of a debate.ldquoI just donrsquot think an introspective debate of that character is going to impress people when there are huge issues facing the country, he said.ldquoI do believe we have that independence to develop our own political agenda on devolved issues. That was one of the prizes Ruth won ndash and I think it set us distinctly away from the rest of the UK.Image: DavidsonSpeaking to The Herald on Sunday, a party MSP hit back: ldquoJackson has been slapped down for making these comments. It is fundamentally not his place to make this decision as interim leader. He has been told he cannot make rulings on issues such as this.Supporters of changing the relationship with the UK party want an internal review to examine a range of options, rather than allowing the issue to dominate a leadership contest.The MSP continued: ldquoHaving a review before the contest makes a lot of sense. We are now in a situation where a majority of our parliamentarians in Scotland are willing to explore other models for the structure of the party, and it would be dficult to conduct that debate within the heat of a leadership contest.A second MSP said: ldquoI am in favour of having another structure and we should have a review or a commission report back before the contest. It would look at the pros and cons of all the dferent models.The parliamentarian said the change was not related to Johnson becoming Prime Minister, but it was essential nonetheless. ldquoIt is necessary because there is a growing sense that devolution requires a bespoke party to deal with devolved issues. Scottish politics has been so ided that we need our own voice.A third MSP said: ldquoIt would be f****** stupid not to be talking about this.Potential leadership contenders include MSPs Carlaw, Fraser, Tomkins, Donald Cameron, Dean Lockhart, Miles Briggs, Liam Kerr and Michelle Ballantyne. An MP could also stand.A party spokesman said: ldquoJackson is more than happy for a debate to take place within the party. However, all MPs and MSPs agree the priority right now is delivering Brexit and managing a General Election that might be around the corner."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn-leaves-open-possibility-multi-option-referendum-scotland","story":"The Labour leader, who has recently been accused of softening his opposition to a referendum on separation, yesterday dodged the question of whether he backed giving voters a choice between independence and federalism.Labour opposed a second independence referendum in its General Election manesto by describing the SNPrsquos flagship policy as ldquounwanted and unnecessary.However, Corbynrsquos shadow chancellor John McDonnell appeared to rip up that policy at the Edinburgh Festival by saying that a Labour Government would not block a request from an SNP administration.McDonnell was accused of undermining Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who has been staunchly opposed to indyref.Corbyn then claried the policy last week by saying he would not back another referendum in the ldquoformative years of a Labour government, although he stopped short of laying down a timescale.Critics believe Corbyn and McDonnell have U-turned because they believe they will need the votes of SNP MPs in the event of Labour being in power.Paul Sweeney, a Scottish Labour MP who is part of Corbynrsquos frontbench team, said recently that Labour should not support a binary referendum, but should offer a multiple choice question, which would include his partyrsquos policy of federalism.Askedbelieved a multi-option referendum was a good idea at a Labour event in Springburn, Glasgow, Corbyn said yesterday: ldquoPaul [Sweeney] is right here, so you are free to ask him the question as well. Paul has been discussing, as have Lesley [Laird, MP] and others, future arrangements which the party will obviously be considering. An incoming Labour Government would not want, or welcome, or support an independence referendum in Scotland.Meanwhile, Corbyn also told the gathering that next week is the ldquolast chance to stop a no-deal Brexit.ldquoWe will do absolutely everything we can to prevent a no-deal Brexit and the Prime Minister taking us into the hands of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the USA.ldquoThat is the real agenda of the Prime Minister.

So the co-leader of the Scottish Greens should be pretty positive. And he is. But, as a populist hard-right Brexit looms, the Glasgow MSP also admits the right have been better than the left at turning despair into votes.The Scottish Greens have chosen an old printworks, Civic House, just under the M flyover at Cowcaddens, to unveil their plan, the first working of what they aim will one day turn in to a programme of government.This venue, home to a vegan canteen and work spaces, is now community owned. Its distressed brick walls smell of wet cement. ldquoHope is hard work these days, Harvie says after stepping away from his podium. ldquoJust look around the world at the climate emergency.ldquoOur generation is being given a stern lecture by young people who are rightly angry at the way their world is being trashed.

The new UK Government ndash ldquothe most far-right in modern history, he says ndash is a major source of anger too.Before his speech, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had just announced that he intends to suspend the House of Commons. Gathered Greens believe the Prime Minister had done so to foil opposition plans to prevent no deal.From the floor an activist refers to the move as a coup.Harvie responds: ldquoI doubt there is anybody in the room who would disagree with the word you said.ldquoThere is a huge job of work in articulating the anger we have to not let him get away with this project.ldquoFor many of them in the Brexit camp it never was just about being in or out of the European Union. It is about wrenching us from an economic model ndash which we criticise and want to improve ndash towards something far worse, something closer to the US.How did it get to this  How did the UK come to be careering towards what Harvie calls ldquodisaster capitalism ldquoI think the right are better at exploiting a crisis than the left are, he says. ldquoTen-plus years ago, when you had a financial crisis, it was created by that centre-right, deregulated, free-market, neoliberal model which could never last, by debt-fuelled casino capitalism.ldquoI am afraid the right have been more effective at exploiting that crisis and the left have not.ldquoNot just the Greens but the left generally need to get better at connecting with people who feel failed, because they have been been failed.ldquoItrsquos not an original observation but populism is offering people  solutions to real problems.ldquoPeople have a right to be angry. But the privatisation of their assets is a far bigger cause of the left-behindness that a lot of people experience than membership of the European Union.How did the EU end up being the focus of anger of those who suffered after the crash ldquoPeople have been subjected to years of propaganda, Harvie says. ldquoNot from all of the media, butyou read a lot of the tabloid media, some of the biggest-selling papers in the UK, you would have a wildly distorted view of what the EU is and what it does.The Scottish Greens co-leader has had his disagreements with the EU.ldquoEurope has been bad at trying to connect with people about why membership of a greater union is a positive thing, he says. ldquoIf the UK behaved in anything like as modern and democratic manner as the EU, I might not even want to leave it.ldquoThe UK is riddled with anachronism and privilege and the embedded power of the City of London.After Johnsonrsquos prorogation gambit First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said independence is now ldquocompletely inevitable.Harvie is not so sure. ldquoNothing is completely inevitable. Hope is hardwork these days. I think itrsquos really encouraging that people are still willing to say Scotland does not need to be locked into a political landscape we donrsquot feel part of.Andindependence fails to materialise  ldquoIf it does not happen, we will see another wave of disillusionment and disengagement, of more people being left behind, Harvie reckons.ldquoOur job is to do our very best to make sure peoplersquos anger is channelled into something constructive, into something positive. Not to deny people have been failed but to identy who has failed them ndash the right wing.And this, for Scottish Greens, is where the Green New Deal comes in. Inspired by the the New Deal of Americarsquos s ndash and a new green deal proposed by progressive Democrats today ndash this is an effort to showwhat can be done even without independence. Its thrust: repurposing the public sector to make Scotland greener and fairer redirecting agricultural subsidies to help green farming and forestry using the embryonic Scottish National Investment Bank to support clean manufacturing.ldquoThere are things we can do right now, even within the constraints of the UK, to reconnect people with the power that comes from community, from local creativity, says Harvie.ldquoWe are human beings. We arenot good at deferred gratication or long-term planning. We are good at being creative and finding solutions.

However, in a time of national crisis, and in the wake of the decision by Boris Johnson to shut down Parliament, all MPs must be heard. So,the Prime Minister is so confident that he can shut down Parliament, why wonrsquot he agree to let MPs vote on that proposal If he wonrsquot agree to a simple vote on whether no deal should happen, a proposal that has been roundly defeated every single time it has been put to a vote in the House of Commons, then we will force his hand. That means enacting legislation that ensures he cannot shut down our democratic institutions in order to force through a no-deal Brexit.

But I hope it doesnrsquot come to that. I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative Party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the country,\" he added.It has been suggested that as many as  Tory rebels are prepared to defy Mr Johnson and vote to block a no-deal outcome.On Monday, Mr Gauke and former Cabinet ministers are set to have their own private showdown with the PM in Downing St.\"I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal.

He replied: \"Everyone will have the food they need,\" and then added: \"No, there will be no shortages of fresh food.\"Askedfood prices would increase, the Scot replied: \"There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Traffic-calming measures will run in tandem with the part-time  zone outside Kintore Primary School\"  Councillors make policy change to improve Kintore School safetyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"sinclairs sign up to support run garioch","story":"Sinclairs Jewellers of Inverurie has joined Dandara, Accord Energy, Ferguson Group, CPCo. and Thainstone Events to become Run Garioch#s latest main sponsor.As part of the family-run business’ th anniversary celebrations in , Sinclairs will be making a substantial contribution towards the cost of chip timing for the event that takes place on Sunday, March , next year.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the afternoon, of course, Tarantino#s latest, which I#d marked down as a #marquee event# in my own head having completed thorough due diligence on the Rotten Tomatoes film site.Careful planning went into this operation. First off, cinema times had to be checked, with the .pm showing being selected to minimise the risk of other folk turning up. As the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said, “Hell is other People” – reportedly after going to a night time showing of Fast and Furious at the Odeon Cinema in the Fe Retail Park – so I was leaving nothing to chance. Jean Paul knew his onions.Next up, a quarter of Sports Mixture and a can of diet coke were purchased from the local ice-cream shop, the original Sports Mixture not the softer version, with the black liquorice slotting into the number ten role behind the main strikers. After paying a very reasonable £. for a premium seat and saving myself around £ on Pick’n’Mix, I sat through  minutes of adverts, paralysed with fear at the thought of a nacho-munching couple, armed to the teeth with buckets of fat coke, deciding to sit within, or on the fringes of, the five row exclusion-zone I’d created. Thoughts of Thatcher and the Belgrano were put to one side and three trips to the lavvy later, my pee-game was tight and I settled in for the feature presentation. The only downer was that I’d eaten all the Sports Mixture and drank the diet coke before the start but I got over the crushing sense of disappointment and made a mental note to “keep some sweets for the film in future”.The movie itself was bang average but it had Brad Pitt in it so the time passed smoothly enough, evenTarantino forgot to include a script – there’s an hour where nothing very much happens – and the ending is ridiculous.Cheers for that Barry Norman – Film  beckons. This got me thinking about great movie stars and how they dfer from other actors who mostly ply their trade on television and in the theatre. It’s not spoken about as much these days, and “star vehicle” seems like an old-fashioned term, but leading men like Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio can pretty much carry any film to success at the box office. Two things are required: a they have to be exceptionally good looking and b we can’t know, or at least remember, too much about their personal lives.Acting ability is important but the real greats understand that doing as little as possible on screen while maintaining a stillness works best. Brando knew this and was lauded for it even when the film was a bit ropey. Of course, I’m talking exclusively about men here.Things are still much harder for women actors despite the #MeToo movement attacking the Hollywood casting system. The term “leading lady” to complement the male star is hopefully redundant but there are still fewer opportunities for women to look cool and very few are given the chance to have their names appear above the title. Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep are the only two female actors I can think of in the last  years who have rivalled male stars in terms of box-office power. Things only appear to be getting better – sure, there are lots of great actors out there like Emma Stone and Kristen Stewart, but no-one yet has the clout of a Foster or a Streep. Perhaps they never will and those days are gone, with a slew of female actors doomed to stay at the same, albeit top, level, having to compete for parts.One of the things I like about Brad Pitt is that he seems fairly normal. You don’t hear horror stories about him being dficult to work with and I imagine he’s the sort of person who doesn’t order off-menu when he goes out to eat. No egg white omelettes for him.I’d like to think he likes a medium-rare steak with chips, or French fries as he probably calls them, and isn’t on a constant diet like most actors – but I’m probably being too kind. I do know he was married to that nice Rachel from Friends, then cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, married her, then got orced again and now has  kids to look after, but that’s no dferent from wee Bert who drives the fish van in Lochgelly. No doubt Brad has made a few stinkers in his time, Troy and The Devil’s Own where he played an “Oirish” republican terrorist to name two, but his movie choices in the last few years have been pretty much flawless and his IMDb filmography ranks among the best. This talk of choices brings me onto the tricky subject of Robert De Niro, or Bobby as I like to call him.His choices have been dreadful for well over ten years now and he’s in danger of ruining his legacy. I’m not loving the stuff he did for Warburtons bagels and the new Kia Niro car advert with a “hilarious” play on his name is downright painful, which makes me questionhe ever was making his own choices on scripts. I know some people don’t mind these shameless earners, and obviously he still gets a pass because he’s Bobby, but it’s hard to watch his classics knowing how the movie of his le has panned out. It’s getting to be like he’s a character out of one of his own films – a down at heel Jake la Motta, or worse still, wannabe comedian Rupert Pupkin from Martin Scorsese classic The King of Comedy. Who knows, maybe his best mate Scorsese has rode in again to save the day with the forthcoming The Irishman... but I wouldn’t bet a quarter of Sports Mixture on it.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli one less role model for women in politics","story":"Regular readers of my column will know I have never had much time for Ruth Davidson. I didn#t buy into the #dferent type of Tory# shtick. All I saw was a woman who was photo opportunity-heavy and policy-lite, and who passed up every chance she had to be an ally to her sisters. I didn’t trust what she said and I hated the wayshe fought the SNP on key policies such as the Named Person clause. Still, there was no schadenfreude – and certainly no smugness to be derived from her tearful resignation as Scottish Conservative leader last week. Coming  hours after Boris Johnson stuck two fingers up at democracy, there was only a sense that we were losing one of the few Tories that had spoken out against him. Everything is relative and, next to the great buffoon, she proved less objectionable. Also, she seemed to have had the stuffing knocked out of her by the conflicting responsibilities of motherhood and public office and by the absence of moral leadership at the top of her party. All the bombast had been drained from her, as it has been drained from many of us by the political events of the past three years and who would take pleasure from that  On one level, the motives for her departure are a complicated mix of the personal and the political but, on another, the explanation is very simple. Isn’t she, like everyone , reflecting on how little power she has to change the current situation and asking: “What’s the bloody point ” There is nonetheless a lot to unpack in her short resignation speech and in the conversation it has provoked. Let’s start with her expression of that gnawing anguish permanently in the pit of many working women’s stomachs: that they are failing in every aspect of their lives that, however hard they try, they will never be good enough. “I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend,” she said, tugging at the heart strings of anyone, male or female, who has ever felt the same. Perhaps this internalised sense of failure comes from women constantly being judged on their behaviour. Since Davidson made the announcement she has been criticised as “letting down” other working mothers by opting out – asshe wasn’t still holding down a full-time job as an MSP and asthe point of feminism isn’t to enable and support women to work or not to work, as they see fit. Given the intensity of the debate it has provoked, Davidson’s resignation speech requires close scrutiny. Was she really suggesting that, in , it is impossible for women to successfully hold down high-flying jobs while raising children  Or was she merely pointing out that it’s still tough and that, because it’s tough, there has to be a worthwhile objective  Certainly, things have improved for working mothers since I had my babies in the late s early s. Increased maternity rights, including shared parental leave, ought, at least in principle, to make it easier to juggle a career and children. But mostly women are still expected to shoulder the bulk of the emotional responsibility. They impose those expectations on themselves, which is why, I think, it makes little dference that Davidson’s partner is also a woman. Then, just as the children become more self-sufficient there are elderly parents to think about. You have to be committed to thole the stress of expressing milk, of leaking through your blouse, of shaking a crying toddler from your leg at the nursery door so you can make a meeting on time. Many women are prepared to miss their baby’s first steps to do a job they find fulfilling. But why would Davidson spend the early years of her son Finn’s le to campaign for the prospective re-election of a government whose goals she no longer shares  What would she tell him in later le  “I wasn’t around much when you were wee because I was pounding the pavements for Boris Johnson” My sympathy for Davidson is not unconfined it would be greater , for example, she had shown any regard for mothers, particularly single mothers, during her time as leader. Instead she voted for welfare reforms which left many below the poverty line, and failed to speak out against the rape clause which requires women to prove their third child is the product of sexual assaultthey want to receive tax credits for them. I hope in time she comes to regret this legacy. She should, in my opinion, have been more direct in her criticism of Boris Johnson and his prorogation of parliament – an act she certainly opposes. And she ought to recognise how lucky she is to be able to make this choice. There are many other womenwho are forced to work several jobs just to get by. The resurgence of the Scottish Tories caused me nothing but dismay. Without Davidson – their great white hope – at the helm, they are neutered, their chances of making an impact at the next Scottish parliamentary elections severely reduced. Davidson was also the single strongest voice in defence of the Union, so logically the chances of a Yes vote in a future indyref must also be increased. And yet, I find it hard to celebrate Davidson’s departure. Though never one for female solidarity, she was part of a bright, new political landscape in which women were, at last, to the fore. Like Kezia Dugdale, she has been pushed out by the political manoeuvrings of a man less able than she is and is likely to be replaced by the same. And who knowsNicola Sturgeon will survive another year. At the last Holyrood election, three of the five main parties were led by women by , it could be none. No visible female role models at the top of politics will make it less likely women will come forward to stand as MPs, MSPs or councillors. There is the potential, though, for her resignation to drive change. Last week, it opened up a fresh conversation about work and family le about how women can be helped to stay in top jobsand how the cultural sht from “motherhood” to “parenthood”, currently little more than a hope, can become a widespread reality in people’s lives. On social media, commentators were proffering innovations: a universal basic income for one adult in every household with a child under seven, for example, so the parents would have more professional options. Of course, no family-friendly policy could counter Davidson’s biggest problem: the lumbering hulk of self-regard that is our current Prime Minister. But,this conversation can be sustainedit provokes more frank discussion about the choices open to women, the pressures on them and the demands of parenthood and politics, it will have served a purpose.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"we must hold our nerve amid turbulent times john mclellan","story":"Ruth Davidson#s departure raises questions about a London-Scotland ide, writes John McLellanRuth Davidson wouldn’t have got baby Finn down to sleep on Thursday night by the time several newspapers were preparing front pages speculating about the Scottish Conservatives breaking away from the UK party to create some sort of Quebec-Baia-Ruritania arrangement or whatever it might be.Although the precise timing and the handover procedures were not finalised until early last week, those closest to her have known for some time that her resignation was coming, in all probability before the start of the new parliamentary session next week. There had been a possibility she would remain in post until a new leader was elected, but having done such a good job during her maternity leave and retaining his enthusiasm for stepping up to the plate, a caretaker arrangement under deputy leader Jackson Carlaw made sense as long as he was not one of the candidates as he had been in .Given the relationship with London was the key iding line between her and Murdo Fraser in that contest, it’s inevitable that it will be raised again against the background of the  per cent Remain vote in Scotland and the furore over No Deal. But while journalists are certainly entitled to ask the questions and for commentators to guess away, the number one question for the party’s senior elected representatives and officials is whether it serves their overarching interests to fuel that debate when so much  is uncertain Maybe discussing anything but Brexit is a happy distraction for some, but as the preservation of the United Kingdom remains the absolute priority for Scottish Conservatives the response to the question should be another question to what extent would separating the party advance its interests when it is likely to be arguing for the maintenance of a much bigger union for the foreseeable future Insiders are already speculating that the contest could be a face-off between Adam Tomkins and Murdo Fraser, in which case a debate about a split could easily become not one ofbut how. And the reaction in the world beyond the party membership, will be “who cares ”Now the succession won’t be decided until the end of the year, no chance of a second independence referendum before the  Scottish elections but the strong probability of an election in early November, what matters is how the party responds to unfolding events.As Ruth’s leadership moved into its final phase after her triumphantat the Scottish party conference in May, events in London dictated that the focus in Scotland would be on how she played the UK leadership election and the fast-changing Brexit situation. Apart from resolutely backing Anyone But Boris, it was her equally resolute opposition to No Deal which was clearly storing up problems and from the outside it seemed like she was needlessly boxing herself into a corner.There was an opportunity to use the summer to pivot away to a new position behind the direction of the UK Government, one which recognised that successful negotiations with the EU to find a new deal she would support relied on the possibility of a No Deal Brexit and an absolute deadline.As someone who always valued loyalty, she would fully appreciate the need for the Scottish leader to support the national position – and she had abandoned her opposition to more devolution for the Scottish Parliament when it was expedient to do so – it looked to me like she was laying the foundations for her own exit. After eight years of arguing, debating, negotiating, manoeuvring, leafleting, canvassing , fund-raising dinners far from home and, of course, the abuse, with priorities changed utterly by the arrival of her son her heart wasn’t in it.That her loyal resignation speech was graceful in the true sense of the word and supportive of Mr Johnson, suggested she recognises the opportunity is there, but it is up to someone  to take it. Polling estimates put support for Brexit in Scotland at over a million, which is a million voters who now have nowhere to go except the Conservative Party. Yes, many of them are right-of-centre Nationalists, but they are people who are willing to put their opposition to the UK on hold while the ties with Brussels are loosened and will not vote SNP while its clear policy is to take Scotland straight back into the EU.The Shetland by-election result demonstrated that although the SNP threw the kitchen sink and all other available appliances at the campaign and increased its vote share by . per cent, the Lib Dems still held on by nearly , votes. The real story of the night was Labour’s miserable sixth place. The once all-conquering people’s party managed just  votes, down from  in  and putting it in Monster Raving Loony Party territory. Admittedly the Conservative vote was only , but that was an increase of  on  when the Ruth Davidson factor was at full strength and the woefully dispiriting May years were yet to come. But with a seemingly unpopular prime minister, the proroguing of Parliament and the announcement of the popular Scottish leader’s resignation, the Conservative vote went up. And yet senior Scottish party figures are saying the only way forward is a new party  OK, Shetland is not a normal seat and the electorate is small, but such up-to-date evidence as we have suggests otherwise.As Ruth said on the eve of the  referendum, Scottish Conservatives have got to hold their nerve. After three years in which the Commons has singularly failed to come up with anything other than opposition to everything, Prime Minister Johnson’s cutting of the Gordian Knot, as he might put it, to slash the parliamentary timetable is a dramatic but legal means to bring matters to a head. Remainer ultras like Speaker John Bercow have twisted convention and procedure to their own advantage and are squealing like suckling pigs now they are on the end of a similar approach.I may be wrong, but the unwillingness of Lord Doherty in the Court of Session yesterday to grant an interim interdict before a hearing on Tuesday suggests the courts will rule the suspension of parliament is a legitimate political move and not a matter for judicial intervention. This is the Brexit endgame and the playing field will be that little bit more level come November.“There’s a lot to be said for strong leadership,” said a senior political figure to me recently in very hushed tones, followed quickly by “and that was off the record.” Because that person was an ex-Labour cabinet minister.Conservatives and Unionists just need to keep the heid.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Records show that the first Worshipful Master was John Featherstone from Moat Road, in Harryville.The current WM is Sir Knght Desmond Armstrong, a Harryville native himself.From the beginning, the Preceptory has had strong but  links with Cullybackey.It was an ‘unwritten rule’ that the WM was a town resident one year and a Cullybackey man in the following year.This is the Preceptory’s fourth banner and replicates the first with imagery illustrating the Biblical ‘Arise and eat for the journey is far’ on one side and Britannia on the other.The original name of the preceptory was also incorporatedGuest speaker at the unfurling, which was held at St. Patrick’s Church of Ireland, Ballymena, was Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson JP.Rev JJ Andrews of Ballee Presbyterian Church dedicated the banner.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help.

There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.“We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship.“But that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, andthe UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.”On Boris Johnson’s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Mr Coveney said: “I’m surehe wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be okay with that.“Michel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that’s ready to go.“We all want to get a deal but at the moment nothing credible has come from the British Government in the context of an alternative to the backstop.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier and his team of Brexit negotiators are willing to dedicate their time to finding a deal “If that changes, great. We’ll look at it in Dublin but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels, but it’s got to be credible.“It can’t simply be this notion that ‘look we must have the backstop removed and we’ll solve this problem in the future negotiation, without any credible way of doing that’. That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and disruptions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Allister claims that each application may have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. He is seeking from Peter May, the permanent secretary in the Department of Justice, a list of the occasions on which Mr McCord has been granted civil legal aid, the subject of inidual proceedings, and the annual amount of legal aid spent on each.Currently, the annual cost of legal aid in Northern Ireland is more than £.m, and some £.m of this is spent on civil cases such as Mr McCords applications.There is no doubting his record as a campaigner. Acting almost single-handedly, he exposed the UVF terrorist gang in north Belfast that murdered his son Raymond jnr in .However, his current reinvention of himself as a legal champion of the Good Friday Agreement, and anything which challenges it, risks confusing the properly separate roles of the legislative branch and the judiciary.Indubitably, politicians decisions must always be reviewable by the courts. However, it should be a general principle that political decisions are taken by politicians, and that the courts become involved only as a last resort, when some fundamental principle becomes involved.Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Justice, underlined this in his BBC Reith lectures this year during which he claimed that the law - and especially the expanding human rights law - was filling the public space which was formerly the preserve of politicians. He argued that judges, and particularly those in the European Court of Human Rights, were exceeding their power by expanding the interpretation of human rights laws. He described this colourfully as \"mission creep\".Should politicians ultimately be answerable to the law  Absolutely. Are arguably frivolous applications, whose costs rise in inverse proportion to their likely success, the best way to do this  Absolutely not.Surely there is a more direct way to \"put manners\" on our political classes - it is called an election.We may get the opportunity to make known our displeasure with politicians sooner than we think -we have the courage to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"major blaze at co cork shopping centre car park","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Butthere is no consensus over who should lead a caretaker government, then Mr Johnson would be able to set the timetable for a general election and could ensure a departure from the bloc on October .Boris Johnson’s attempt to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of his plans for a reckless No Deal Brexit is an outrage and a threat to our democracy.

He said its aim was to manage the \"unique\" risks the UKs departure created for Northern Ireland. Mr Barnier also said it would be a surprise to himmany people in the UK thought blame lay with the EUthe UK crashed out without a deal. He repeated that should the UK crash out without a deal, the same obstacles would remain and the EU would be forced to protect its interests.He wrote: \"It is not about changing the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. That is none of the EU’s business, as it is the Good Friday Agreement – an agreement between the British and Irish governments and political parties in Northern Ireland – that settles how Northern Ireland should be governed.\"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods.He said the backstop \"fully respects the carefully negotiated balance found in that agreement between the competing political views and dferent identities in Northern Ireland\". \"Its objective is simply to have an insurance policy in place that guarantees that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remains fully open, and that the status quo of cross-border exchanges on the island of Ireland is maintained. \"At the UK’s request, we agreed to have a UK-wide customs dimension to that backstop.\" He said intense discussions among the  EU member states were had on maintaining the integrity of the single market while allowing for an open border on the island or Ireland. He said the backstop offered the \"maximum flexibility\" to a non EU member. \"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods, which the EU is exceptionally willing to offer due to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. I believe that the people of Northern Ireland recognise and appreciate this offer more than Westminster does for now.\"Read MoreBarnier not optimistic as Johnson speaks of ‘signs of progress’ in Brexit talksGove refuses to sayGovernment would abide by legislation blocking no dealBrexit: Westminster set to be scene of high drama in week aheadHe said that the EU was committed and ready to explore all alternatives in working with the UK during the transition period should the UK leave with a deal. Those alternatives, he said, would have to provided the same objectives of the backstop - namely maintaining an open border and protecting the integrity of the EUs single market. He conceded though he was not optimistic over avoiding a no-deal Brexit.\"Uncertainty has festered for far too long in the UK, in particular in Northern Ireland, as well as in Ireland and all other EU countries, for that matter.\"Mr Barnier saidthere was a no-deal Brexit the EUs only option was to protect its interests and there would be no \"mini deals\" which have been raised by Brexiteers including the DUP. He said the outstanding matters of the Irish border, citizens rights and the financial settlement would still need to be addressed.\"The EU cannot prevent the UK from choosing a no-deal’ scenario. I would fail to understand the logic of that choice though, as we would still need to solve the same problems  after October .\"Many people in the UK understand that and I would be surprisedthey succumb to the idea that the EU is to blame for a dficult political situation in the UK.\"Boris Johnson meanwhile has spoken of “signs of progress” in Brexit discussions. The prime minister restated his case for a harder Brexit, telling The Sunday Times the country needed to “come out of the incarceration of the backstop”.He added: “Everybody understands what is wrong with the current withdrawal agreement: it keeps the UK locked into the EU. It means they can boss us around on trade policy or on how we legislate forever.”The interventions from both sides come ahead of another pivotal week in the Commons and an expected clash on the green benches when opponents of no deal look set to try to seize control of the parliamentary agenda to push through legislation delaying Brexit beyond October ."},{"url":null,"title":"speaker bercow in open opposition to people who voted leave","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles. It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of

From September , pickleball sessions will take place every Wednesday between .am and .pm.Pickleball is a paddleball sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis. Two or four players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated polymer ball over a net.The sport provides a good aerobic workout and can be enjoyed by all ages and skill levels.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all. Wersquove called on the Housing Executive numerous times and used up all the repair forms at the back of our rent book, but still no-one had it fixed.Mrs Mildred Terry was equally unhappy. ldquoThe last time they came to fix the fireplace three years ago, they simply pushed it back against the wall and plastered it over the wallpaper which we had just put on, she said.ldquoIt became a big nuisance having to hope that friendly neighbours would help us wash our clothes and provide us with baths, because we were unable to heat our water by the use of the fire.BISHOPSCOURT mdash Police are investigating the circumstances leading to the death of an RAF sergeant at Bishopscourt last Tuesday evening. The sergeant was seen running into bushes at the camp and two shots were heard. He was found later with two gunshot wounds to the head.

Mrs Josephine King, on behalf of the people, presented Dr Moore with an inscribed watch and a cheque and Mrs Moore with an inscribed watch, while Miss Una Hardy presented Mrs Moore with a bouquet of flowers.Dr Moore thanked everyone for their generosity and stressed how much he had enjoyed practising in the Castlewellan area for so many years.SAINTFIELD mdash Residents beside a quarry near Saintfield who frequently had windows broken in their homes when blasting took place had their grievances aired at a recent meeting of Castlereagh Borough Council.A local councillor, Mr J A Lowe, raised complaints of householders whose windows are shattered by blasting at Lisdoonan Quarry.Mr Lowe said residents had suffered from broken windows and undue noise on many occasions. He wanted to knowplanning permission covered the size of explosives used in the quarry.He was told that  conditions were attached to the planning permission, covering such issues as the size of explosive charges and the permitted distance from the nearest dwellings.KILLYLEAGH mdash Work on a major housing redevelopment programme in Killyleagh is in danger of grinding to a halt. Speculation is mounting that the main contractors are getting ready to pull out because of unpaid bills by the Housing Executive.Ten houses which have been virtually complete for six months are still lying idle because minor sub-contract work has not been started. Ten families, who were told last December that new homes would be ready by February, are still waiting and the situation is fast becoming a deadlock.The poundm redevelopment scheme at Irish Street was to have been a Housing Executive showpiece. Work began on building  new homes in two phases in . The scheme had been designed to ldquoretain the character and charm of Killyleagh, transforming the old houses into modern housing for some  people.The Housing Executive have flatly refused to comment on the latest developments at the site and they will not go into the many complaints, except to admit that there are problems at the site.Three weeks ago a major row erupted all over the province when a dispute in the Executiversquos finance department caused a backlog of payments to dozens of small construction firms.DOWNPATRICK mdash A group of residents in the Flying Horse housing estate in Downpatrick are campaigning for proper dustbins to be provided.At present residents are supplied with paper bags which they say are too small and do not hold any great weight of refuse.

I hope that by implementing this action plan we can make a real dference to the residents of our district.Last year, there was across-the-board political support for a motion calling for a major housing conference to take place to address the social housing crisis.At the time, it was revealed that Newcastle was a social housing need hot spot with  people on the waiting list for new homes classed in the urgent need category.Politicians were told that a lack of available land to build new homes was exacerbating the crisis in a resort where rented properties were at a premium, with houses that do come on the market snapped up by people for use as holiday homes.Councillors say they are keen for all ious stakeholders collaborating to provide short, medium and long term solutions to tackle the crisis.In addition, they are keen to see a focus on building appropriate housing for the changing needs of the district, including the increasing demand for single occupancy dwellings and housing that meets the needs of vulnerable people.Politicians say more affordable housing is also required as house price growth is higher in Newry, Mourne and Down than the average growth experienced across Northern Ireland.They say there is a need to plan for long term needs, tackle homelessness and the poverty gap, social housing development and accessible homes provision.Politicians say they hope that by working with partners across the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors, they can come up with solutions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special film of Canon’s Excursion brings back memories  ","story":"THE screening of a special short film on the old Canonrsquos Excursion in Downpatrick took place at the townrsquos Ballymote Centre last weekend.Every summer, over  buses packed with local families would head off from the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic but thoroughly enjoyable day.The last excursion is believed to have been held in the s, but local people last weekend had a unique opportunity to relive those halcyon days, thanks to a new initiative being spearheaded by the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association.It helped put together the short film which captures some of the the sights and sounds of the Canonrsquos Excursion which was one of the key events in Downpatrickrsquos social calendar.The film was screened last Friday night in front of a number of Stream Street residents and Housing Executive representatives when all those involved in the project were publicly thanked for their support.John Gordon, a member of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which played a key role in getting the film project off the ground, was delighted to many people attended last weekendrsquos screening.ldquoIt was great to see some of the original Stream Street residents attend the screening which also provided people with an opportunity to reminisce about the old days, particularly the Canonrsquos Excursion which was a big event, he explained.John said the project to produce a film depicting the annual event was launched around two years ago and is pleased those who attended Friday nightrsquos event enjoyed themselves.ldquoA number of old photographs were also on display which brought back many memories for some, he continued. ldquoWe are deeply indebted to everyone involved and those who help make Friday night such a

sparked calls for action to be taken against teenagers terrorising the community in the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable. The perpetrators must be dealt with.Mr McGrath said police and other statutory agencies require information to challenge the anti-social behaviour and apprehend those responsible.He added: ldquoInformation can be provided confidentially and is needed to help break this cycle of behaviour at this part of Downpatrick.Police have asked anyone who believes they can assist them with their enquiries to make contact using the non-emergency  number or the confidential Crimestoppers number,  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10343429.jpg","title":"road closed security alert fermangah border","story":"Police are currently in attendance at a security alert in the Wattle Bridge area of Newtownbutler this morning following reports of a suspicious object in the area.A spokesperson for the PSNI commented: \"The ersions are in place between Newtownbutler and the border and on the A - Clones Cavan Road in both directions.\"This may cause signicant disruption in the area and motorists are advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes.\"This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

That party said it had been giving her time to “do the right thing” over pensions .I understand that Lord Caine tried to block a re-appointment and advocated be a fresh competition for the victims’ post. Again the question arises: who now is advising Julian Smith  It doesn’t matter how smart an advisor isneither minister nor advisor has experience of the nationalist long game.The DFA would not let inexperienced Irish ministers be outwitted.Victims and proportionality are not at the heart of the legacy process, which seeks to keep the IRA on board and never challenges the implication that UK state, loyalist and republican are all culpable. For years I have written on this page about the moral collapse over terrorism. But outside of this paper’s legacy scandal series, and a handful of columnists for other publications such as Ruth Dudley Edwards, one travesty after another passes with little comment.Look at how another isolated voice, Trevor Ringland, who has spent a letime in reconciliation, has become increasingly blunt about the appeasement of terror. There has been much focus on the latter failings of Ms Thompspon’s tenure. Among the earlier things that happened under her watch was the time Martin McGuinness addressed a victims’ event and demanded full accountability of the UK state on the past.A man who orchestrated decades of bloodshed, and who was wholly secretive about ithad the nerve to tell an audience, that included people he helped make victims, that others must be frank.When we reported that grotesquerie, Professor John Brewer accused us of ‘conflict journalism’.Imagine a Parachute Regiment leader lecturing an audience including victims of state violence about how others must disclose.It is no surprise to me that the NIO did not conclude that a victims’ commissioner should be accepted by the largest category of victims. Had they done so, it would have upset nationalists.

But Brexit has shown that its ancient grievance about Britain is still alive.Of course it is reasonable for the Irish to be furious about Brexit. As it happens I always thought Brexit fraught with perils for unionists.But the prevailing high mindedness in Dublin, the complete lack of empathy with the confusions and struggles of its neighbour on a complex issue, Europe, that has caused plenty of confusion and ambivalence in Ireland too, the almost unison reaction of its media, which cheer leads its government , has reminded some of us that we want nothing to do with Irish unity.Yet there are endless references to a ‘new Ireland’ debate.Note that unionists and mainland Britons never harry Irish nationalists into participating in a ‘new UK’ debate, perhaps on what a post Brexit Britain might look like. It would be a stupid thing to try to impose such a debate on nationalists. So can nationalist Ireland please realise the same in reverse  Unionists do not want to give cover for ‘new’ packaging of an old idea, the unication of Ireland.Ben Lowry: The NIO above all is determined never, ever to upset Irish nationalismIt is telling that NI secretary felt unable to replace Thompson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: NIO is determined never to upset nationalists ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Sir Knights on parade for the annual lsquoLast Saturdayrsquo demonstrationsAround , Sir Knights and hundrends of bands converged on six venues for the Royal Black Institution#s annual #Last Saturday# demonstrations.

And on hearing Him speak be prepared to do what He asks,” he saidOn the subject of loyalty to the Queen, Rev Anderson said such loyality “must mean more than nice-sounding clichés, wrapping ourselves up in the Union Flag or simply calling ourselves loyalists”. He also recalled how Northern Ireland had endured what he called “a ruthless, violent campaign by republicans” for the reunication of Ireland.He said: “As far as they are concerned, Ireland will be a much better place for us than remaining within the United Kingdom,” he said.Rev Anderson pointed out that the UK is the fth largest world economy, and posed the question: “Can we afford to move to this wonderful utopia called Ireland ”The third resolution was on the constitution, when Rev Anderson referred to some of the present constitutional dficulties.“Having the right to abort the le of a healthy baby, just because it is the woman’s right to have a choice, surely is wrong. Where is the right to le ” he asked.“What of the defence of the family unitwe continue to break down the definition of marriage  The truth is we must have a clear understanding of who our relatives

against our experiences of the past before allowing such momentous changes to our way of le today.”At all six demonstrations, a statement was read on behalf of the Chaplains’ Committee.It expressed “dismay, disappointment and great sadness at the recent passing of the amendments to the NI Executive Formation Bill paving the way to force through legislation which compromises the sanctity of marriage and endangers the lives of unborn children”.The chaplains said that the Royal Black Institution “passionately believes in the right of the unborn child,” and that “being a Bible-based organisation we also believe and affirm that marriage between a man and a woman was instituted by God with Adam and Eve”.The statement called on elected representatives to do all within their power to

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
