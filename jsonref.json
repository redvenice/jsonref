pilot demonstrates that families didn\u0027t just want the meals.\u0027Although they valued the meals, they didn\u0027t like the labelling of them being free. They actually prefer to pay a modest amount, £1 or £2.\u0027 It came as Mr Mellen accused the Government of failing to live up to its promises on funding to tackle child poverty. He told Sky News: \u0027The Government has given a shortfall in council funding over many years, 10 years of reductions.\u0027They promised at the beginning of this year that they would stand shoulder to shoulder with us and meet the needs of our Covid costs and our lost income.\u0027We are still several tens of millions short on that promise.\u0027I am not convinced that the Government are not double-counting here on the money that they are saying that we already have to meet this need.\u0027He added: \u0027They do that quite often.\u0027The Prime Minister insisted yesterday the Government would not allow children to go hungry but he refused to bow to demands to extend the free school meals programme. Mr Johnson highlighted the money already given to councils and said Universal Credit was \u0027one of the best ways you can help families in this tough time\u0027. Mr Sunak echoed a similar sentiment today as he told BBC Radio 1\u0027s Newsbeat programme that \u0027we should be able to trust local councils in different areas to make decisions for their people\u0027.  He added: \u0027So I don\u0027t think it\u0027s always the right answer that central government comes in and dictates things.\u0027The Government has increased Universal Credit payments by £20 per week during the pandemic but that increase is due to be scrapped in April next year.Tory MPs are now calling on ministers to keep the increase in place for longer as they also said the Government should simply U-turn now on free school meals. Former Cabinet minister Stephen Crabb said the Government should have conceded on the issue last week.\u0027I think the Government should just deal with this head on, concede on the issue of vouchers but say very clearly and firmly that vouchers at best are not a long-term solution,\u0027 he said.Mr Crabb said the Government has created a political problem with ministers talking up the role of Universal Credit.He said the fact it is a temporary increase is in \u0027the small print\u0027, adding: \u0027We are on course to cut that money back in just a few months time and for me that\u0027s just unconscionable.       \u0027You can\u0027t give money to some of the poorest people in the country and then go out publicly and celebrate that fact and then say \u0027oh by the way, even though we may still be living with the consequences of the pandemic next April we are going to cut that money back by around £20 per week, £100 per month\u0027.\u0027And that\u0027s going to be a much bigger headache for the Government than school meals.\u0027The Government faced criticism this morning from its food tsar, Mr Dimbleby, who said holiday clubs would be a better way of addressing food poverty than money through the benefits system.The co-founder of restaurant chain Leon told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \u0027This problem is real, it should go without saying it\u0027s serious, it\u0027s immediate and it\u0027s going to get worse as employment gets worse and the Government isn\u0027t doing enough.\u0027One in seven families already are reporting not be able to afford enough food.\u0027Mr Dimbleby, the head of the national food strategy, said he has been lobbying ministers to act.He said that \u0027in-kind support\u0027 through holiday clubs, providing food and education, had been shown to have a better impact than putting the same \u0027small amount of money\u0027 into Universal Credit.\u0027I haven\u0027t been backward in coming forward with ideas that I have been feeding in to Treasury, to Education and to Number 10, ideas of how they could rapidly implement this by Christmas,\u0027 he said.\u0027But… the dark centre of government is invisible to me and I have no idea exactly what they\u0027re working on as we speak.\u0027 Downing Street has been nutmegged by

April 2018, a month after Raniere was taken into custody in Mexico. They both made bail then in April 2019, pleaded guilty to racketeering charges as part of plea deals to reduce their sentences. Bronfman was sentenced to 81 months in a federal prison but Mack has not yet been sentenced.Raniere founded Nxivm with Nancy  Salzman, a psychiatric nurse. It was designed to be a self-help group and was based out of Albany, New York.Executive Success Programs, Inc., was another name for the courses. Raniere had, until then, tried and failed multiple times to launch his own business. He\u0027d grown up in Suffern, New York, with orced parents, one of whom worked in advertising. After graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, upstate New York, in 1982 then tried his hand at marketing before launching Nxivm. At the time he founded the organization, he was in a relationship with Toni Natalie, the woman who introduced him to Salzman.Natalie later recalled Salzman becoming enthralled with Raniere, as many other women who met him did.  One of the turning points in the cult came in 2002 when Salzman and Raniere recruited members of the influential Bronfman family. The Bronfmans come from the Seagram liquor empire and are heiresses to billions. According to his indictment, Raniere tricked Clare Bronfman into giving him millions over the years. Her sister, Sara, was not as enthusiastically involved. It was through the Bronfman sisters that the first signs of trouble in Nxivm emerged. In 2003, Clare told their father that she\u0027d loaned Nxivm $2million. He became suspicious and publicly accused Raniere of running a cult in a Forbes article. For the next several years, they tried to legitimize themselves with wholesome associations, all the while running the cult of sexual servitude to Raniere behind closed doors. In 2009, the Dalai Lama even appeared on stage with Raniere at an event in Albany, NY.   In 2011, actresses Allison Mack and India Oxenberg became some of the newest recruits to the group. Mack rose through the ranks quickly and grew close to Raniere, who was referred to as the \u0027Vanguard\u0027 to cult membersIn 2015, DOS was created. It stands for Dominus Obsequious Sororium - which translates to Master over Slave Women in Latin.It was a sub-sect within the cult that involved women being branded with Raniere\u0027s initials and having to perform sexual servitude. Oxenberg has told in the past how she was enslaved to Mack. Part of the \u0027discipline\u0027 training was controlling how many calories people ate.She would have to ask permission for when she could eat, she has since revealed. Raniere\u0027s indictment refers to DOS as the a \u0027pyramid\u0027. Almost all of the DOS recruits were \u0027vulnerable\u0027.  \u0027When identifying prospective slaves, masters often targeted women who were currently experiencing difficulties in their lives, including dissatisfaction with the pace of their advancement in Nxivm. \u0027While avoiding the words master and slave in the initial recruiting pitch, a master would tell her prospective slave that the prospective slave had an opportunity to join an organization that would change her life,\u0027 Raniere\u0027s indictment reads. \u0027The master then told the prospective slave that, in order to learn more, she had to provide collateral, which was meant to ensure that the prospective slave would keep what she was about to learn a secret. \u0027Collateral consisted of material or information that the prospective slave would not want revealed because it would be ruinous to the prospective slave herself andor someone close to her.\u0027Raniere was also charged with trafficking at least one young woman from Mexico. The woman, Daniela, had been awarded a scholarship at a prestigious school in Switzerland but she gave it up to travel to the US and join NXIVM. At Raniere\u0027s trial, she testified that he kept her confined in a room for nearly two years because she\u0027d shown romantic interest in another man. She said she was controlled by him after he sneaked her into the country illegally from Canada. \u0027Sex meant access when it came to Keith...I was without a doubt a captive from a moment I was illegal in the country. \u0027As time progressed it was clear to me I could not leave,\u0027 she told his trial.She said she first had sex with him on \u0027dingy\u0027 sheets when she was 18 but that her younger sister slept with him when she was just 16.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Price denies

The title comes from the Italian conidere, which means sharing, and the images show groups of people living together in isolation, whether they are families, single people or mixed groups.Every picture belongs to two authors, the home-based photographer and the subject, and they share the whole process of creation of the final picture via a video call. The subjects their time, their life, their intimacy and their image, first with the photographer and then with society. This process, in addition to the narration of the day-to-day cohabitation of the subjects, serves the social and community purpose of sharing your own mental and physical condition, from inside to outside, similar to the very human need to interact with the rest of the community.Rudy: “It has been a hard time. We have tried to spend time together dedicating ourselves to our passions in our small house in Florence. We managed to train in the little space we had at home. It was difficult but we succeeded and so we were able to vent our anxieties and emotions of that difficult moment.”Some families managed to reunite after the Italian government imposed lockdown measures on 9 March 2020, while others were separated, with some family members left stranded in remote places. In other cases, single people were forced to cohabit with strangers. During the health crisis, the meaning attached to the word cohabitation has changed, creating new relations from a forced sharing, in particular, of spaces, habits, feelings and fears.Giulia was able to observe at first hand the great love between her parents, who in lockdown celebrated 47 years of marriage.

We heard about the health emergency in Italy, but by then it was too late. So we decided in a meeting that we would continue the journey and when possible we would come back to Italy. We were afraid we could not return home, but we continued our journey away from the health emergency.”Prisca, a photographer, and Val, a stylist and model, live and work in London.

During the lockdown the garden was our salvation. There we were free to share our time while maintaining personal spaces. I was very worried about my relatives in Italy and every day I watched the news from my house in Uruguay”.Fulvia: “If before we were planning the next journey, at this moment we were only hoping to be able to see Fulvia’s family in Italy again at some point. Fulvia called every evening with her family back home comparing the numbers in Italy and Germany with the ones of the day before. One of us lost the job, and the other one was lucky enough to be able to work remotely.But yet we were the lucky ones, as we spent our days in our living room learning the things we thought weren’t so important as our job or our life outside. So we practiced singing, playing the guitar, started indoor gardening, creating handmade goods and taking care of each other, in short, we learnt how to give value to our time.”Lucrezia and Oliver have their own company, Oliver Party Express, which rents furniture. They took advantage of the quarantine to work behind closed doors in the laboratory on new projects. The laboratory, located a few metres from both their homes, allows them to produce new objects.

The quarantine has made me rediscover my home ... the peace of an evening in bed reading with a lighted candle or watching a movie with my sister. Now I no longer go out every night. I also rediscovered the pleasure of being at the table with my parents. Working far away, I never came home, and I missed lunches. Emotionally it was a gift, the quarantine. My family has benefited a lot from it.” Martina: “We lived our lockdown locked in our house outside Padua. Walter and I create special effects for the world of cinema. For example, this is an enlarged reconstruction of Rita Levi Montalcini. Luckily we have our own laboratory near home. During the lockdown we were able to work every day and finish some personal projects.”Just before the lockdown, Francesca and her friend Andrea left Milan to join the Della Seta family in Carrara.

BP said it had reduced its headcount by about 2,800 people so far, in part through a voluntary redundancy programme. Thousands more will follow in the coming weeks with BP aiming to complete the majority of the cuts this year.Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, assured investors that the company would keep its existing idend policy in place after reducing it by half in August, the first cut since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. He also promised that the oil giant’s move towards low-carbon energy would be based on projects which offer strong returns.“Having set out our new strategy in detail, our priority is execution and, despite a challenging environment, we are doing just that – performing while transforming,” he said.Looney said in May that the collapse in oil market prices triggered by the coronavirus meant he was “more convinced than ever” that BP’s low-carbon transition was necessary. The company took its first steps into the offshore wind market months later by taking a $1.1bn stake in two US offshore wind projects being developed by the Norwegian state oil company Equinor.BP’s energy economists have said demand for oil may never recover after the pandemic, which has taken a heavy toll on transport industries, and may be on the brink of an unprecedented decades-long decline.The company slashed the value of its oil assets this year to reflect its view that oil price forecasts would be below expectations as a result of the pandemic. The write-offs led to a net loss of $16.8bn in the second quarter, but in the absence of further writedowns BP reported a fifth consecutive net loss of $500m for the last quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ebba036776c569f8c79e6844afba5d3c3f66a/1067_1077_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00783b811366564a2254f5d0ef0e7002","title":"covid rules economic caring relationships respected england","story":"More household-centred, realistic guidelines in England would be likely to gain greater complianceFor anyone adjusting to the rules set out under the government’s three-tier system for England, it won’t come as a surprise that they fail to match up with our lives. A “care gap” has emerged caused by regulations and guidelines in which people are severed from extended family, friendship and care connections.A national conversation about the care gap began in May with a public outpouring of anger after Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham and his claim of “exceptional circumstances” justified by childcare needs. In research into care work during lockdown for the London School of Economics (LSE), my colleagues and I found that this was a turning point in people giving up on government rules. They were anguished that they had sacrificed their own ties for so long, but they were also given implicit permission by Cummings’ example to prioritise these ties above all else.Families found creative ways to bend regulations as social restrictions eased. For example, since paid cleaners and nannies were allowed into homes but not relatives or friends, people simply paid a token amount to grandparents or fellow mothers. People broke the rules because of the intense emotional sacrifices they involved. The rules seemed unethical too because they prioritised financial relationships over those of caring ones. Eventually, due to campaigns by Ella Davis for single parents, and by Carers UK, families were allowed to link to one other single person household.Under the English tier 2 and 3 restrictions, we have not returned to the extremes of the last national lockdown with exceptions for childcare bubbles, support bubbles with a lone person household, and essential care provision and support groups. The government has obviously learned that care matters, but it has not yet understood that people are unlikely to respect rules that break essential bonds by banning household mixing outside of one limited support bubble.In places high on the index of multiple deprivation, it has become clear that, across all communities, interventions in households make little sense. Among disadvantaged and minority ethnic communities, family and friendship are broad and include several households, with sometimes more than six people living in a single household. Paid childcare and eldercare are rare because of cost and instead caring within family and friendship circles are valued. These capacious networks don’t fit into the new rules. The rules are seen as “nonsense”, especially when there are greater limits placed on these ties in tier 2 and tier 3 than on economic activities. They quite simply do not make sense in terms of our moral compass, meaning that some people choose to bypass them rather than denying their family or friends the vital care they need.When people try to follow the rules, they experience emotional strains in navigating them. The majority of people we spoke to had faced mental health issues for the first time. Women in particular have worked hard to support others, with a “squeezed middle” of midlife women developing, who juggle the dilemmas of caring for children, young adults and elderly people. One 50-year-old woman said, “Mental effects were starting to show after three months despite the fact that I am a perfectly healthy person.” mother from London explained: “I have been the only carer to my two children with no break as friends and family can’t help. I haven’t been able to care for my elderly parents. This has driven me to the edge of my emotional reserves.” It is important to remember that these stresses have never ended in parts of the country that were kept under restrictions such as Leicester and Blackburn.What could be done about the impracticality of the rules? Our research suggests that the government should only severely restrict household interaction in tier 3. New social-bubble and rule-of-six policies could instead be introduced. These would dial up and down the levels of social interaction in terms of numbers of households connecting according to the severity of local outbreaks. In tier 1, up to four households of any size could form a social bubble. In tier 2, three households of any size.During circuit-breakers or national restrictions we would have to return to tighter rules, with regular connections between the same group of six people to create limited caring networks. That could be one elderly relative being looked after by his two adult children and their partners, or two friends helping with the childcare of one family of four.More household-centred, realistic rules would be likely to gain greater compliance and respect among all segments of the UK public. fears about transmission in unregulated private spaces could be overcome by a public health campaign about Covid-safer behaviours in homes, specifically for self-isolation, multiple household interactions and domestic work. Caring has never been so important and so at risk.• Laura Bear is professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, and a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours and the Ethnicity Subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3e1df3890cf91b62b22a1e8e75b038b3fc65e3/158_58_1310_786/master/1310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28cdfedf74f439d0435173cb1d8c6beb","title":"england food tories children free school meals holidays","story":"In the row over providing free school meals during holidays, ‘shall we feed children?’ has become a complex questionWe have a lot to say about eating food right now for a culture whose cuisine essentially boils down to “can I put the word ‘pudding’ on the end of it?” Black pudding. Yorkshire pudding. Steak and kidney pudding. This is a country where we consider the detritus from a deep-fryer as a fun treat that deserves its own name (“scraps”). This is a country where haute cuisine is splaying open a bag of Scampi Fries in front of a warm pint of ale with the hearty offer to “dig in”. Our food is awful, and we still refuse to give it to the children.Quick recap: the Tories voted against extending free school meals to children in England during holidays until Easter 2021. In other words, it’s been a fretful week of worrying whether choosing to deprive children of lunch during holidays is “fundamentally evil” or “savvy conservative fiscal policy”, and frankly the fact that we’ve managed to get through it without calling an election or forcing some sort of referendum (Nigel Farage ceremonially floating down the Thames on a freight ship full of pink custard, shouting “NONE OF THIS FOR YOU” at local schoolchildren that have been assembled on each bridge) seems like blessed relief.Tory MPs have responded to the national outcry by focusing instead on every historical instance of someone being rude to them, starting with a formal letter to Keir Starmer about Angela Rayner and evolving elegantly towards the tweet by even-he-was-surprised-he-got-in representative for Birmingham Northfield Gary Sambrook, which many would argue is the high point of literature and human culture thus far. “Apparently if you disagree that vouchers is the only way to solve poverty this is what happens,” he said, alongside a photo of graffiti that read: GARY SAMBROOK EATS BIG DINNERS and SCUM. “Cellar door” had a good run as the high point of phono-aesthetics but I think we can all agree “Gary Sambrook Eats Big Dinners” is now the most perfect sentence ever written. I have said as much in an email to the Louvre, which is interested in replacing its puny little Mona Lisa with this section of wall.Before some new-to-the-game Tory councillor sees this article and sends me a prim response via the medium of an open letter on their town’s local Facebook page, I do recognise that the issue is slightly more complex than “feed children”“do not feed children”. The overarching argument here is that feeding hungry children is somehow too straightforward and obvious, and that the better way to attack the immediate poverty of “I’m quite hungry, could I possibly eat something please?” is actually to filter money through councils (which the Tories have spent the past 10 years defunding through austerity) or to let them survive on universal credit. There are better ways to feed children beyond just feeding children, 322 MPs argue, it’s just you lot aren’t clever enough to see them.I’m sure there’s some logic in this, somewhere, if you squint at the Magic Eye poster for long enough and turn it upside down enough, it’s just – on the surface – it really does actually seem as simple as, “Shall we feed children? Well the nays have it”, and that’s what’s so baffling about the whole thing. Over the summer, extending the free school meals scheme cost an estimated £126m (about one-and-a-half Big Ben restorations), and after a few months spent watching the Treasury spray out furlough money, spend actual billions on a failing test and trace system and give us all a Wagamama discount, it does really seem like giving lunch to children was a fairly easy PR win that has been instead turned, via that dreadful alchemy this country excels at, into the practice of telling other people how to live.I’m referring, of course, to the small-but-vocal minority online trying to solve child poverty with clever, dreadful recipes and fond false-memory nostalgia for making second world war rations last. “Buy a whole chicken from Aldi for £2,” one now-deleted tweet read yesterday. “Roast it for Sunday lunch. Make chicken sandwiches for the following day. Stew the bones, produce a stock, add sweetcorn \u0026amp dried noodles for a tasty soup. 3 tasty meals for less than a fiver.” Where in the budget is there room for the sweetcorn, bread, butter, noodles, energy to roast a chicken for an hour-and-a-half, bus fare to Aldi and back, clothes for the children eating the sandwiches, shoes for the children eating the sandwiches? Eh, figure it out. Someone else suggested the recipe of a simple 14p egg, boiled for two minutes. I suppose one way of resolving child poverty is to poison the poor ones until they die, but I personally think we should keep that as plan B, behind just feeding them in the first place.• Joel Golby is a writer for the  and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c58845a80564a5f456be37315115cc1ff8a321a/0_128_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92893037669125a5bb2156c5587543b6","title":"indian child poverty charity offers free school meals in uk","story":"Akshaya Patra, which feeds millions in India, opens first of three planned kitchensA charity that feeds millions of poor children in India has joined the drive to end holiday hunger in England and distributed its first meals from a new kitchen in Watford.Hot vegetarian dishes cooked for less than £2 each using a model developed to feed the hungry in cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad were dispatched to a school in north London on Tuesday amid growing pressure on the government to reverse its decision not to fund free school meals this half-term.Trays of hot cauliflower cheese and mixed vegetable pasta cooked by chefs working for the Akshaya Patra charity, which produces 1.8m meals for schools daily in India, were collected by Kate Bass, the headteacher of Mora primary school in Cricklewood, from a purpose-built kitchen designed to cook 9,000 meals a day.“Desperate measures for desperate times,” she said as she loaded her car boot with cartons of food. “Even families that were managing before aren’t managing now.”The charity is planning to set up similar kitchens in Leicester and east London and expects to keep delivering free meals to schools in the Christmas holidays.“It might seem strange to some that this model is imported from India,” said Bhawani Singh Shekhawat, the chief executive of Akshaya Patra. “But we are bringing a tested model from a country that has dealt with this problem with speed and at scale.”The charity also aims to sell meals to schools for less than £2 a portion – with half paid by the state and half by its donors.Recipients at Mora primary included Atika El Mir, a mother of two, who said money was tight because her husband has had less work because of Covid. “Everything is hard times now,” she said. “This is a good idea. It is so kind.”“It’s difficult to feed the kids at the moment,” added Dennis Perez, a design technician picking up the hot food on a scooter with his three young children. “I work full-time, but after rent and bills … The council can’t give me anything because I work more than 16 hours. That’s why I grabbed this opportunity.”Campaigners said the expansion of an operation developed to end child food poverty in India in the UK was a sign of how serious the problem had become.“One can scarcely believe the new methods communities are having to deploy to protect children from hunger and this is another example,” said Andrew Forsey, the national director of Feeding Britain, which is lobbying the government for a permanent increase in universal credit payments and to establish universal holiday activities and a food programme.Lyla Rees, an eight-year-old pupil, came to the handout with her mother, a school governor. “I wouldn’t want my friends to go hungry over half-term,” she said.The Akshaya Patra kitchen uses steam cookery to keep levels of fat low. The project’s backers have watched with concern at the contents of some of the lunches being put together by volunteers this week, featuring crisps and sugary drinks.“It solves the hunger problem, but not the nutritional problem,” said Shekhawat. “It creates problems like juvenile diabetes and coronaries.”“Hunger in the UK has been a problem for much longer than this. The solution is to bring in the technology and innovation that India is already using. They have a nutrition problem, we have a nutrition problem, but they are doing this already.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8aae42d3e0cdce4e8d50634d68fb40eee76f50/100_0_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48a3d8abb5d162cf2554a22fa6477eac","title":"bp leads energy companies preparing two major uk carbon capture projects","story":"17m tonnes of carbon dioxide to be stored beneath the North Sea every yearAfter decades spent extracting fossil fuels from the UK’s North Sea, a consortium of oil companies is preparing to pump Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions back beneath the seabed to help meet the government’s climate ambitions.BP has set out plans to lead an alliance of energy companies in siphoning off the carbon dioxide from factory flues under new plans in which almost half the UK’s industrial emissions will be stored beneath the North Sea from 2026.The veteran North Sea oil extractor is leading a partnership including Italy’s state oil company Eni, Norway’s Equinor, National Grid, Royal Dutch Shell and French energy company Total in a plan to transport 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year from two separate carbon capture projects based in the Teesside and Humber industrial clusters on England’s east coast.At Teesside, BP will work with the same oil companies, in a separate venture, to capture up to 10m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the industrial cluster – equivalent to the same emissions produced from the energy used by 3m UK homes – from the mid-2020s.Meanwhile, at the Humber a separate alliance including National Grid, Equinor and power generator Drax hopes to capture at least 17m tonnes of CO2 from hundreds of refineries and factories.Andy Lane, BP’s head of carbon capture solutions, said the project represents a “significant milestone” towards developing the offshore infrastructure needed to safely store carbon, and the oil industry’s “willingness to come together and collaborate wherever possible” to contribute to the UK’s climate goals.Carbon capture and storage is considered vital to the UK’s legally binding target to create a carbon neutral economy by 2050. It would also be “virtually impossible” for the world to meet its climate targets without it, according to the International Energy Agency.There are still only 20 projects in commercial use worldwide but the IEA believes that in the last three years plans for more than 30 commercial carbon capture facilities have come forward, representing a potential investment of about $27bn (£20.7bn).The UK government has promised £800m to decarbonise at least two heavy-industry “carbon clusters”, the first in 2025 and the second by 2030, falling short of calls from MPs and the government’s official independent climate advisers at the committee on climate change to roll out multiple carbon capture projects within the next five years.The Northern Endurance Alliance has applied for funding from the government’s £170m industrial decarbonisation challenge which was set up this time last year. The support is part of the government’s £4.7bn industrial strategy challenge fund which was set up by the government to address the biggest barriers to the UK’s future productivity and earning power.• This article was amended on 27 October 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said that the Drax coal-fired power plant would be involved in the Humber estuary carbon capture project Drax’s coal units are set to close in March 2021, before carbon capture begins. Also an earlier version referred to salt caverns beneath the North Sea seabed, when it meant to refer to saline aquifers.

And what does this tell us about pig farming today? The answer to that question starts where most of the world’s pigs end up, in China.And so the huge magnetic pull of the Chinese market has only grown. A kilogram of pork that fetches about $3.30 in the US wholesale market is worth nearly $7 in China, creating huge incentives for processors to send pork abroad.You may be wondering, at this point, about the famous meat shortages at the beginning of the pandemic weren’t meat plants shutting down because of sick workers and pigs being culled? In fact, though US domestic hog processing declined in April, processing rates rebounded relatively quickly, rising back to well above 2019 levels by June. That was partly thanks to industry activism to gain government support. Meat processing giant Tyson chairman John Tyson published a full page ad in the Washington Post and elsewhere in April saying “there will be limited supplies of our product available in grocery stores”. A ProPublica investigation found that meat industry actors may have had a direct hand in drafting the executive order that was announced by President Donald Trump just days later, which provided cover for meat plants to remain open or reopen despite the fact that workers were still getting and spreading Covid-19.So why did Maxwell Foods, one of the biggest pork processors in the US, announce earlier this year that it would be quitting the sector by the end of 2021? About the same time, the company also filed a lawsuit, asserting that its demise wasn’t due to natural causes, but the direct result of actions by another company, one that was both an important customer and competitor: Smithfield Foods. Maxwell Foods is one of the largest pork producers in the world, making the list of the top 31 global pork mega-producers for possessing 100,000 breeding sows. The company reported producing 1.1 million pigs for slaughter in 2019. A subsidiary of Goldboro Milling Company, Maxwell has contracts with about 120 farmers in North Carolina to supply its animals. In the statement announcing the end of operations by mid-2021, the company cited “low prices” for its products as a primary driver.But Smithfield, against which Maxwell has now filed a lawsuit, is even bigger. The company, owned by China’s WH Group, tops the list of global mega-producers with 1.23 million breeding sows, producing more than 6bn pounds lb of pork in 2019. The $16bn company is the largest hog producer in the world, and critically, Maxwell’s primary customer.According to the lawsuit, in 1994, the two companies entered into an agreement that Smithfield would purchase all of Maxwell’s pork produced in the Carolinas and Virginia. As part of the agreement, Smithfield gave Maxwell a sort of “most favoured nation” status, agreeing to extend Maxwell the best price it was offering to any of its other partners.Since then, the lawsuit has continued, and Smithfield’s aggressive pursuit of vertical integration has consolidated the market and left Maxwell vulnerable to Smithfield’s whims.“Scale matters, even between very big and huge,” writes Lee Miller, an agricultural law expert at Duke University. “The Maxwells of the world – while enormous by historical standards – do not wield anything approaching the power of Smithfield, in either market or political spheres.” Smithfield’s foreign ownership adds to the complexity, he says, because a company that might at least have some trickle-down benefits for local communities now sends profits to foreign stockholders, leaving communities near pork production facilities and workers at slaughter plants with significantly less access to company decision-makers.Then, in April 2020, Smithfield stopped purchasing the full amount of Maxwell hogs, according to Maxwell, instead buying only half. The company pulls no punches in its summation of these actions, writing: “Smithfield has engaged in its course of conduct … for the express purpose of harming Maxwell’s business and with the objective of driving Maxwell out of hog production altogether so as to benefit Smithfield-owned competitors of Maxwell.”In response, Smithfield told the  that it was regrettable that Maxwell was “taking legal action against us for what is fundamentally a commodity market issue of low livestock prices, from which we have also suffered. The allegations by Maxwell Foods are not true, and we will respond to the lawsuit accordingly.”So what does Maxwell’s fate tell us about meatpacking today? Fewer companies and plants mean our national meat supply is becoming less resilient and more beholden to foreign markets and priorities. But the idea that the Maxwell’s of the world are the “small family farm” underdog is also untrue. Maxwell v Smithfield is a battle of titans, and often the people who lose most when they collide are consumers, workers, and taxpayers. The demise of Maxwell points to the fact that consolidation in global meatpacking is reaching its end stages. Defying that trend, creating more resiliency, and protecting the people involved will require a complete re-imaging of the system. Until then, the battle of the giants rages on.“These companies,” says Patrick Harris-Robinette, a livestock rancher in North Carolina who owns his own processing facility and markets his products directly to consumers, “are mining our resources. And once the mine is expended, they’ll move on to another country.”Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

What’s more, there are now more options than ever for putting your money where your values areStereotypes die hard. A misperception persists that investors are staid men in grey suits. Even when it comes to investing in ethical or sustainable funds, many people still assume that only wealthy philanthropists have the luxury of being able to do so.But the democratisation of investing means that these days anyone can make an informed, empowered decision about how to put their extra cash to good use. Here are four everyday investors who decided to put their money where their values are, by investing with Triodos Bank.At that time he was working in an engineering capacity on flood plain risk analysis and clean air projects. Being involved in the sustainability sector meant he was already keenly aware of the climate emergency, and it felt right to put his money into something that aligned with his beliefs, personally and professionally.At the same time, he had been attending some green community events in Bristol, where he had heard about Triodos Bank, and its ethical ethos. He and his wife decided to sign up, opening a Triodos Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA, and later a Triodos current account. The ISA was part of their long-term financial planning as they knew they could put money away for five years plus.Sian Herschel, 43Having spent much of her career working in funding for organisations such as the Fairtrade Foundation and Comic Relief, Sian Herschel is no stranger to impact investing. These roles saw her making decisions about how charitable funds should be invested in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, she worked on helping small-scale farmers improve the quality of their products or get a fair price. “I’m very passionate about the impact that social enterprises can have,” she says.This interest in positive social impact spills over into her personal finances too. “For me, it’s really important to know where my money is, and how it’s being used,” she says, citing Triodos’s transparency as a key factor in her decision to invest with the bank. “That was number one in terms of criteria. The second was that I strongly believe that it’s not enough to just try to ensure that your money isn’t being used in a negative way. It’s more important and also more interesting, to be honest, to invest in positive action in businesses that are actively not only trying to do no harm, but actually trying to do good.”Herschel and her partner, who live in Buckinghamshire with their two boys, have a few different ISAs with Triodos, including its Innovative Finance ISA (IFISA), which can be used to hold crowdfunding investments tax free. They might use money from their Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA if they ever wanted to start a business or buy a property, or to help pay for their children’s education.Jacqui Furneaux, 70 “I used to walk past the building every day on my way to the library,” says Jacqui Furneaux, speaking about the Triodos Bank UK head office in Bristol. One day in 2014 she decided to call in, as she was interested in its ethical credentials. “It’s not a branch or anything but I didn’t understand that at the time. The woman who saw me explained everything and showed me all over the building – all the renewable and eco-friendly stuff they’ve got there. They had a display wall with goods from ethical companies that they support and I thought, this is the place, I’ll look no further.”As a retired nurse, Furneaux feels that more of her life is behind her than ahead of her, but she is concerned about the kind of world being left to her daughters and grandchildren. Investing in causes she cares about, such as renewable energy and organic food, gives her peace of mind that she is playing a part in a fairer, healthier planet.After retiring in 2000, Furneaux travelled the world by motorbike, and then wrote a book about her experiences, using her local library as a place to do research and to work, hence her frequent visits. It was her travels that opened her eyes to some of the world’s injustices.“I have seen so much poverty and inequality,” she says. “I wanted to do my bit I didn’t want to invest in arms, or tobacco, or anything that I really don’t believe in.” Furneaux has invested in the Triodos Pioneer Impact Fund and the Triodos Global Equities Impact Fund, both through a Triodos Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA, and says she may use the money to help her grandchildren one day.Alasdair Macdonald, 72In the early 1990s Glaswegian Alasdair Macdonald and his wife, Kate, decided they’d had enough of the mainstream banking sector. A wrangle over a simple cheque had left them with a bad taste in their mouth and, at the same time, they were keen to use their money to support ethical causes.Macdonald was active with his local branch of Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity, so was already aware of the concept of protecting the planet for future generations.

There is much to be done outside, especially if you are determined that next spring and summer will bring an even more bounteous and beautiful garden. There is not much else to look forward to, so you may as well give yourself the gift – and smug satisfaction – of thriving plants. Here are some of the things you can do with optimism for better times ahead.Whether you plant them in a small window box, a balcony container or a large garden, a bag of bulbs is a relatively inexpensive and easy way to invest in future happiness. “There is nothing like a flash of tulips to really put a smile on your face in late spring,” says the garden designer and TV presenter Katie Rushworth. “Always plant more in a pot than you think you’re going to need – layer them.“When people see tulips out everywhere, they think they can go and buy them at the garden centre, but actually you can’t.” You can find flowering tulips in some garden centres, “but there is never anywhere near the same number of varieties as you can buy in autumn. To plant them now and see them come up next year is much more rewarding.” Get them in within the next month.Don’t stop at tulips: the gardening writer and designer Naomi Slade calls bulbs “spring’s bling” and suggests planting alliums, camassia and narcissi.Borders can be tweaked or completely transformed. “Plants don’t always behave as they say on the label or you thought they might,” says Slade. “I have a helenium that is doing brilliantly, but it’s huge and it’s at the front of the border. Over the next few weeks, I’m going to move some of the things that are getting crowded out into a different space in the garden and move the helenium backwards.” Spreading mulch (such as compost, well-rotted manure or wood chippings) at this time of year – especially on a vegetable plot – will mean there is enough time for it to work its way into the soil over winter, says Walker, “and will give plants or seeds you sow in the spring a really good start. If you mulch in spring, it tends to sit on the surface and it can be quite hard to sow into, so it’s worth doing now.” It also means you can clear weeds and improve the look of your beds. If you have moved plants around, it is particularly important to give them a good mulch.Start some early sweet peas, says Saul Walker, the head gardener at Stonelands House in Devon and the host of the gardening podcast Talking Heads. “They should germinate in the next month and you’ll get sweet peas about three or four weeks earlier than if you sow them in spring, which means you can plant them out in March or April. Some people say you get better flowers as well.” The impressive sweet peas you see at flower shows are sown now, he adds. They can be sown inside on a windowsill as long as it is not a room that gets too warm. If you don’t have root trainer pots, then any fairly deep pot will do.As well as keeping plants healthy, iding plants is like getting them free, says Rushworth. Do it now and next year your garden should have a more established, abundant look. “If a herbaceous perennial has done really well, lift up the root ball and break it into a couple of pieces.” This can be done by hand, or with a fork, although she adds that she has been known to use an old breadknife to saw through woody roots. You can then plant it around the garden (in similar light conditions) or near the original plant.People tend to buy one of each plant, says Rushworth, “and it can look quite ‘bitty’ – it always looks better if you plant in threes or fives. Block out an area with the same variety and it will look better for having more of it.”“Next year, you should start seeing shoots by next autumn, you should have a rose bush you’ve made all by yourself.” It won’t look that impressive next summer – it should flower the following year – “but it’s really rewarding and it doesn’t cost anything”, says Rushworth.Ordering some bare root roses now is a speedier option – and they are much cheaper than buying potted roses next year. “They might not look like much when they arrive, but if you get them into the ground or in a pot, with some good soil or compost, they will take off,” says Slade. “They’ll start growing roots over winter and then they’ll be in a good place to get flowering in spring.”What do you mean you don’t have acres of fashionable wildflower meadow? In that case, sacrificing your lawn, or creating a small wild patch somewhere in your garden, will do.A boring, but satisfying, job. If you are lucky enough to have a greenhouse or cold frame, give the glass a good clean (as well as the rest of it – detritus and disease will have built up). “Now that we’re getting less light, you want to make sure your greenhouse is getting as much of it as possible,” says Walker. It is the same indoors, if you are growing on windowsills. “It’s worth keeping your windows clean, because you’ll be surprised how much light is kept out by dirt.”Clean out bird boxes, or put up new ones, to fill your garden with life-affirming cheeping come spring. A pile of logs, or a homemade or bought shelter, will give hedgehogs, frogs and toads somewhere to spend the winter they should repay you by munching slugs.Seasoned gardeners think ahead. Make a note about what worked well this year, what did not and whether there were periods when you could have done with more flowering plants, advises Rushworth. “It’s really easy to forget,” she says. “Make plans then you can hit the ground running in spring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700fbb03dcf4caad4290b2c35f84ffd2da7b36b4/0_364_5233_3141/master/5233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84470267473728ef69b003371c7ada90","title":"what are your plans for christmas in the uk coronavirus","story":"We want to hear how you are planning on spending Christmas during the pandemicIt may still be over a month away but with Christmas expected to be different this year and many areas of the country under local restrictions, we want to hear what your plans are for the festive season.How are you planning on spending Christmas with family?

Tech journalist Sarah Frier looks at how it went from a tiny startup to a multibillion-dollar business, and the impact the social media company has had on our livesSarah Frier is a tech reporter based in San Francisco who has watched the meteoric rise of Instagram, from its humble beginnings as a startup with a handful of employees to becoming a $100bn company. She talks to Rachel Humphreys about how the photo-sharing platform has become the most influential app of the past decade.  Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, was 25 when he started his company with his friend, software engineer Mike Krieger. Systrom realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones, and with Instagram the app would also offer filters that people could use to make their photos – and by extension, their lives – look more appealing. In 2012, with just 13 employees, the company was bought by Facebook for $1bn. With the introduction of Instagram Stories, its growth accelerated, but the relationship between the two companies was complicated and Systrom and Krieger eventually left Instagram in 2018. Mark Zuckerberg now controls two of the most important social media networks in our lives.

The male cyclist received a minor injury to his arm and was taken to hospital as a precaution.Donnachadh McCarthy, the co-founder of Stop Killing Cyclists, said: “We hope this crash will be a wake-up call to Keir Starmer that the Labour party needs to do far more to hold the government to account for failing to invest the £6bn per year needed for protected cycling infrastructure, as advocated by the UN, to enable kids to cycle to school safely, as they do in Holland.”He added: “Keir Starmer should be setting a good example by cycling around Camden, not using a child-endangering and high-embedded carbon SUV.”Starmer’s office said he spoke to a member of the British Transport Police at the scene and provided a badge number of the officer concerned.A spokeswoman for the force confirmed an off-duty police community support officer witnessed the collision and provided Starmer with their details.The Met police refused to confirm Starmer’s involvement, but issued a statement saying no arrest had been made.A spokesman said: “The driver of the car had stopped at the scene and exchanged details with the cyclist but had left before officers arrived. Officers later attempted to contact the driver of the car and left a message advising him to report the matter to police. The driver of the car subsequently attended a north London police station. He was not arrested or interviewed under caution.”A spokesman for the Labour leader said: “Keir was involved in a minor road traffic accident on Sunday. He spoke to a British Transport Police officer who attended the scene and swapped details with the officer and the other inidual involved.“Keir stayed at the scene until the ambulance arrived. Later that afternoon, he reported the incident to a police station in accordance with the law. Since the incident, Keir has also been in touch with the other inidual involved.”“We sent an ambulance crew to the scene. A person was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital.”Two residents who witnessed the aftermath of the incident told the  they saw two police cars and an ambulance at the scene of the accident at around 12.30pm outside a swimming pool on Grafton Road.The residents, who declined to be named, said they assumed there had been an accident at the pool because an officer was guarding the entrance.The latest statistics for traffic collisions on roads in London show signs of an improvement in safety for cyclists that has coincided with an expansion of cycle lanes in the capital. Figures from Transport for London released last month showed five people died while cycling in the capital in 2019, down from 12 in 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bcdf845c3ef620cb510fa16ca2c46615d2b533a/0_128_2244_1345/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4b0326deae4a9fcddd8ddac35b8a70","title":"salmond accuses sturgeon of pursuing vendetta over report into harassment claims","story":"Lawyer says ‘clear objective of Scottish government is to tarnish reputation of our client’Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon’s government of pursuing a vendetta against him in a major battle over the release of the official report into sexual harassment claims against him.In a further escalation of the long-running dispute between Salmond and his former friends and allies, it has emerged the Scottish government plans to ask a judge for permission to hand over the report that upheld two claims of alleged harassment against him to MSPs investigating the controversy.John Swinney, Sturgeon’s deputy, has told a Scottish parliamentary committee the government wants to release the official report into the harassment complaints and a covering letter sent to Salmond by Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, in August 2018.The government’s decision to uphold the complaints was leaked to the Daily Record newspaper, triggering a bitter legal battle. Salmond took the Scottish government to court and won in January 2019 when it admitted its internal inquiry was unlawful and “tainted by apparent bias”.In a batch of new letters released by a Scottish parliamentary committee on Tuesday morning, Salmond’s lawyer, David McKie, said those documents should have been destroyed in January 2019 after Salmond won his case.Swinney told the committee on Monday some papers had been destroyed, but the two documents sent to Salmond were kept.McKie said that showed “the clear objective of the Scottish government is to tarnish the reputation of our client and to seek to distract the committee from the core remit of investigating the Scottish government and the first minister”.Swinney revealed that government lawyers would go to the court of session seeking permission to release those papers, and up to 2,000 other pages of evidence and documentation used during Salmond’s civil action against the government.Following a separate criminal trial in March 2020, Salmond was acquitted at the high court in Edinburgh of 14 charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape, involving nine female civil servants and Scottish National party officials.Among a series of further disclosures on Tuesday, more questions emerged about Sturgeon’s failure to disclose that she was told in March 2018 Salmond was under investigation.Sturgeon admitted earlier this month that she was told about the investigation by Salmond’s former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein when they met in her Holyrood office on 29 March 2018, but had forgotten it had taken place.Sturgeon had repeatedly insisted she first learned of the allegations when Salmond told her during a private meeting at her home on 2 April, a meeting followed by phone calls, text messages and a further meeting between them.It was not until 7 June 2018 that Sturgeon wrote to Evans to disclose those contacts, but her letter to Evans, released on Monday, does not mention meeting Aberdein. That delay has led to Sturgeon coming under a separate formal investigation for breaching the ministerial code by an independent ethics commission because the meeting involved government business.Sturgeon has denied Salmond’s allegations of a conspiracy or of collusion. She told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I think the reason perhaps he is angry with me – and he clearly is angry with me – is that I didn’t cover it up, I didn’t collude with him to make these allegations go away.”In a disclosure that will raise further questions about what Sturgeon knew and when, McKie also asserted that her principal private secretary, John Somers, twice met one of the two complainants in November 2017, soon after the complainer indicated she may have allegations to make against Salmond.In his letter to the committee, McKie said another as-yet-unidentified person was at one of those meetings. They took place several weeks before Sturgeon signed off on the new anti-harassment policy in late December 2017 that allowed civil servants to make retrospective complaints against former ministers. The two complainants filed formal complaints against Salmond in January 2018.Salmond’s allies allege the Scottish government admitted defeat in his civil action because his lawyers were about to call Somers, forcing him to admit Sturgeon’s office had had contact with the complainers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58aac266f4d7c125a427ffcf0beba864e0713b7/0_4_4560_2738/master/4560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed7cb09373d8c4d89594d415db8ecc17","title":"cycling how to change your inner tube in seven easy steps","story":"Don’t let a puncture deflate your cycling spirit. Here’s everything you need to fix a tyre like a bike shop proYou’re freewheeling along happily, when suddenly you’re very much aware of the bumpy road beneath your wheels – and your bum. As the sound of rubber dragging on asphalt gets louder, reality hits: you’ve got a flat tyre.Whether punctures happen on the way to work or mid-Strava segment on your Sunday training ride, flats are a frustrating part of life on two wheels. Investing in decent tyres such as the near puncture-proof Schwalbe Marathon Plus, which come with a 5mm-thick puncture guard, can massively limit your risk. But even the toughest treads can’t protect against all of the pesky sharps that might make you spring a leak.The good news: even if you do get a flat, with the right preparation and only a little patience, they’re easy to fix. We enlisted the help of one of Schwalbe’s experts, Tim Ward, to bring you this simple step-by-step guide for a speedy swap. Here’s how to get back on the road – and fast – after a puncture.Step 1: Tool upYou’ll need a set of tyre levers and a pump – track pumps are best for home use, while lightweight portable pumps or a portable CO2 inflator are great for speedy roadside re-inflations. Plus a ner, or 5mm or 6mm hex key if your wheels aren’t quick release.Step 2: Release the beastIf the tyre isn’t already fully deflated, use the valve to release any remaining air. This creates extra wiggle room for removing the inner tube and tyre. With the wheel on the ground and the valve opposite you, use your thumbs to push the sidewalls of the tyre, forcing the bead into the middle of the rim on one side. Then use the heels of your hands to unseat the bead all the way round, forcing all the slack into one place.Step 3: Leverage some advantageInsert a lever between the rim and the tyre on one side of the valve and hook it into a spoke to keep it in place. Top tip: Schwalbe’s levers have a handy clip for this. Insert a second lever on the other side of the valve, followed by a third lever a little farther away, until a section of the tyre pops over the rim. Now use your palms to release one side of the tyre all the way round.Step 4: Take the tubeOnce one side of the tyre is off, you can reach in, grab the inner tube and remove it, freeing the valve section last. Check your tyre carefully for glass or nails, inside and out, and inflate the inner tube to feel for holes. Keeping the tube in the orientation it came off the wheel helps match pin-prick puncture holes with the offending items in the tyre. If you can’t find the culprit and you spring another leak, now might be the time to invest in a new tyre to prevent repeat punctures.Step 5: In with the newHave a quick whizz round and make sure your rim tape fits edge to edge, isn’t damaged or kinked, and that there are no sharp edges and no spoke holes showing. Before you insert the new inner tube, inflate it slightly as the shape will help seat it correctly in the centre of the rim bed. Replace it valve first, tucking the tube under the tyre, avoiding any pinch points. Then deflate the inner tube again. If you’re replacing your tyre too, check for directional arrows as these show which way the tyre is designed to sit on the wheel to ensure optimal cornering and braking traction.Step 6: Get into the grooveNow return the tyre beading back inside the rim, section by section, starting opposite the valve. When the last bit inevitably becomes too taut, go back and squeeze the beading of the tyre together to help it find the deeper grooves inside the rim. Then use the heels of your palms to work the slack round. This should create the clearance you need to ease on the final bit. If you need to use a lever, take special care not to pinch the inner tube.Step 7: Pump it upBefore you grab the pump, go around the tyre and check there’s no inner tube poking out of the side underneath the beading. Do this on both sides. Prior to fitting the rim nut on the valve stem, push the valve up into the tyre a few times to clear the tube in case it’s trapped under the bead. Finally, pop the wheel back on, then inflate the tyre to appropriate riding pressure – not exceeding the max PSI, which is stated on the tyre or rim. Keeping them at the right pressure will help them last longer.To find your flat-less tyre, visit schwalbe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8834efcba5a62cd5f27840dc8c0123f44a2987d/81_0_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5dd37d5c7db81d67c2affdef03d6cb88","title":"journey into a black hole part 1 podcast","story":"They are among the most enigmatic phenomena in the universe, confounding physicists and mathematicians.

The tins are made in the UK from recycled tin, so they’re especially popular with people trying to reduce their use of single-use plastics.” The latest scent developed by the pair is a woody, spicy candle called Late Summer. “The feedback we’ve had from customers has been incredible,” says Pothecary.Website: thebotanicalcandlecoAddress: 6 The Commons, Shaftesbury, Dorset, SP7 8JUUK delivery available, terms and conditions apply.Portulacaria Afra, £8Discovered in Prick, Hackney, LondonMerchant: Gynelle LeonGynelle Leon opened the shop of her dreams when she found herself trawling London for succulents and cacti, and discovered that finding unusual specimens was a surprising challenge. “Even though there are thousands of varieties out there, I couldn’t easily find them to buy for myself,” says Leon. “This particular variety isn’t easy to find,” she says of the distinctive Portulacaria afra. “But the striking red stem contrasting with the lighter green leaves – which are round, and quite cute – make it a very attractive plant, and one that’s very popular with my customers.”Website: prickldnAddress: 492 Kingsland Road, London, E8 4AEUK delivery available, terms and conditions apply.3 Metres of Facts tape measure, £4.99Discovered in Bartrums, Hay-on-Wye, BrecknockshireMerchant: Kate Brotherton-RatcliffeKate Brotherton-Ratcliffe is the owner of Bartrums in Hay-on-Wye, which even smells like an old stationers.

The coffee is sourced in Guatemala, decaffeinated using the Swiss water process in Canada and roasted in London’s Shadwell to give a bean with notes of caramel, cherry and dark chocolate. “The process doesn’t harm the environment, and in a blind taste fools anybody: my neighbour was drinking it for the past year, thinking it was caffeinated,” says Ayers.Website: thegentlemenbaristasAddress: 63 Union St, London SE1 1SG, and four other locations of its nine sites currently open (see Facebook page for updates)UK, EU and American delivery available, terms and conditions apply.Tideswell tea, £2.85 for 30gDiscovered in Cup \u0026amp Saucer, Chesterfield, DerbyshireMerchant: Gail HannanThe Tideswell tea is one of a range inspired by Lake District towns, created by Gail Hannan. “Tideswell is famous for the lime it produces so this is a black tea, with lime leaves, dried lime peel and pieces,” she says. “It’s refreshing, nice hot or with ice on a summer’s day.” She sources ingredients locally wherever possible, although the black tea comes from China and India and the limes are from the local greengrocer. “I haven’t yet found anyone who grows limes – or pineapple or coconut – in Derbyshire!”Website: cupandsauceronlineAddress: 132 High Street.

Though, as nature goes into hibernation, forests, woods, parks and arboretums can often feel alive with walkers, joggers and families exploring them.The experience of lockdown has changed many people’s relationships with nature and will undoubtedly extend our interaction with the arboreal beyond the traditional leaf-peeping season. Outdoor trends, such as forest bathing, awe-walks and even park strolls, have become a lifeline to many, and now the UK’s most spectacular spaces set aside for trees – arboretums – are seeing record numbers of visitors.“The arboretum being shut for 10 weeks had a huge impact. More people have come than ever, even though we have capped the numbers. In August, we had 10,000 more day visitors than last August,” says Andrew Smith, director of Westonbirt Arboretum, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire.Tony Kirkham, head of arboretum at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, describes arboretums as “a living reference library of trees”. At Kew there are more than 2,500 species from around the world, some of which are nearly 300 years old.“The term arboretum became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it’s slippery,” says Paul Elliott, professor of modern history at the University of Derby. “Arboretum meant tree collection, but it was more than just a group of trees of the same kind: it was a systematic collection that had botanical significance. However, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, they became a bit of a joke. You’d see people in their small gardens having a few trees and labelling it an arboretum.”There are no strict lower limits on what constitutes an arboretum and many are still in private hands. Elliott estimates there are more than 200 in England and Scotland, recorded on the National Heritage List for England and the Historic Environment Scotland inventory of gardens and designed landscapes (figures are not available for Wales and Northern Ireland). Many, such as at Westonbirt (known as the National Arboretum), started life as private collections by wealthy iniduals.“It was a craze for wealthy people with some land,” says Kirkham. “Lots of these people went for rarity, the new introductions. As they were being discovered, they wanted to be the first to have them in their collections.”The first tree to be planted at Westonbirt was a Scots pine to mark the 21st birthday of Robert Stayner Holford, heir to one of the grandest estates in Britain, and founder of the arboretum in 1829. With serious tree planting beginning around 1852, thousands of trees from Asia and the Americas were planted in this part of Gloucestershire.“If you look at maps of the time, they created an arboretum from nothing,” says Westonbirt archivist Alison Vry.The man responsible for this craze among the upper classes, says Elliott, was John Claudius Loudon, a Scottish writer, landscape designer and “a key early proponent of the idea of arboretums as a public place”. Loudon was a prolific horticultural and landscape design writer, and he communicated many of his ideas through the Gardeners Magazine, which he started in 1826.“He was very interested in transforming the urban environment by ‘greenifying’, or beautifying towns and cities, and bringing parks, gardens and green spaces to the masses,” says Elliott.Following the publication of his eight-volume Arboretum et fruticetum britannicum in 1838, Loudon was given the opportunity to put his “Gardenesque” theories of landscape design in public spaces into practice on land gifted to the people of Derby by textile merchant Joseph Strutt. Derby Arboretum opened in 1840 as what its current manager Mick McNaught describes as the “first purpose-built public park in Britain”.Free to the public for two days a week at first, and with 1,013 species of inidually labelled trees, McNaught says Derby Arboretum “was laid out as a scientific collection. Both Strutt and Loudon were committed to educating the working classes. It was all about trying to give a place of recreation and enjoyment, while at the same time offering an opportunity to improve their minds.”Derby Arboretum was an instant success, and sparked a wave of park openings across increasingly industrialised Britain. Elliott says that as a result, “arboretums were adopted as a model for public parks”.“There was this idea that people would walk around the park and be learning botany and arboriculture, reading the guidebooks and observing how the trees were growing.”McNaught says of Derby Arboretum that “even today, to the people who live around it, it’s their local park, but it’s of national importance”.The connection between public education and recreation was always part of the plan for Derby Arboretum. But even trees planted centuries ago as private collections have since come into the public domain. Princess Augusta’s extensions to Kew Gardens in 1759 are today seen by two million visitors a year. Similarly, Westonbirt opened to the public when management of the park was passed to what is now Forestry England in 1956 .Kirkham explains that “a big role for an arboretum is education, because schools can come in with a teacher and do every part of the national curriculum. Maths by measuring trees, working out circumference and volume. History and geography – the year they were introduced and where from. They are an amazing educational resource.”And it is a resource that’s becoming important in terms of conservation and climate crisis. “Our collection also provides a place to study how a changing climate is affecting a variety of tree species,” says Westonbirt’s Smith. A walk around Derby, Kew, Westonbirt or any of the other UK’s arboretums on an autumn day demonstrates that whatever their histories, they are a much-loved part of the landscape. They also have an important role to play in our future health. “It’s been proven that trees are good for your mental wellbeing,” says Kirkham. “They have shown that sick people get better quicker if they can see trees from their hospital window. An arboretum that people can walk round, looking at seasonal attributes should be highly valued.”He adds: “I think if we can draw people into an arboretum and tell them stories about trees, then trees will get the respect that they deserve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac69ee7e256133b906816af35e55b3d7f3ea74d/0_115_7441_4465/master/7441.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c7cc2df3eb10691b0335480e12955a25","title":"shingai shoniwa my hair myself","story":"Ahead of a new Channel 4 programme, the singer explains why hair and identity are inextricably woven together for people of colourI would describe myself as a Brit of Bantu heritage. Due to the colonial borders that were put in place in sub-Saharan Africa, a lot of Bantu people were separated into different nations. My grandmother is from Malawi, previously called Nyasaland. They made a sharp border with Northern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and the east Portuguese protectorate, now Mozambique, which is where my grandfather is from. My parents were born in Zimbabwe, but I grew up in Lewisham, south London. I was lucky that as a child I was encouraged by my family and community to wear my hair in its natural state – my friends and I wore styles such as Bantu knots and cane rows with pride. Even my white friends would get the odd braid or two. Getting your hair done as a little black girl felt like an expression of love and nourishment. It would be styled by my gogo – my grandmother – or my mum, or an auntie, or anyone in the community, really there was a support network for women of colour who cared for the hair of the children around them. The reaction from other kids towards my hair was positive – they thought it looked really cool, like an alien. But when it came to adults, and certain institutions, there was a more negative reaction.At secondary school, that negativity increased. We were bombarded with chemical products from America, and teachers questioning whether our natural styles fitted the “hair code”. Things got more pointed once I entered the workplace. I worked at a posh department store in Kensington as a teenager – a very old, respected establishment. I had cut off all the hair damaged by those toxic chemicals, and put it into plaits. One day, I was pulled off the shop floor. I was making a sale – being my usual happy self – when I was marched off by three members of staff. They said there had been complaints about my hair, and that it could be seen as intimidating. It was, they said, more respectable when it was straightened, and they gave me two options: to have a stranger style my hair in the “grooming” department or be sent home. I stayed calm and said I would leave, but I went home and cried. I was so scarred by that experience. To me, the idea of grooming was for pets, not for humans.Once I knew I wanted to be an artist, later in my teens, I started to feel more confident about my hair. I threw myself into drama and started singing and playing in bands when I was 16. It was then that I realised an intrinsic connection between black creativity and adornment has existed and been evolving since the beginning of time. I felt much more inspired and confident on stage, and in my community, asserting myself as an artist with African heritage. There was a lot of pressure to adopt the hairstyles that were being celebrated in pop music and fashion across the Atlantic, especially for primetime media positioning, so it hasn’t been an easy journey, but I’ve always celebrated natural styles, regardless of what was trendy.So many artists in the UK have done the same, from Sade’s natural curls to Omar’s dreads. Grace Jones, Skin, Soul II Soul were also trailblazers. Then, latterly, you have had people like myself, VV Brown, Laura Mvula, Little Simz and Lianne La Havas. Artists in the US, such as Solange, Janelle Monáe, Willow Smith and Kelela have also been embracing natural Bantu-inspired hair styles. But when I started out, natural hair wasn’t visible or popular in pop videos or commercial content. I was treated like an outsider by the mainstream press, and even some of the black community. I had to fight to have every single piece of artwork approved for my releases, and I constantly had to remind people about the contribution of African musicians to rock-and-roll and punk. It felt as if I didn’t belong or deserve to excel in that genre, plus being a genre-fluid musician was rare. It wasn’t until I got the L’Oreal Mizani haircare campaign in 2013 that I realised I was being referred to as a natural hair icon. I’ve still to feel that way in the sense of my musical contribution, but I’m hopeful as it’s a great time for someone like me to be listened to.I think it’s really lovely that people of other cultures can – and have – positively appropriated aspects of black hair and beauty. I just think it’s important that we are allowed to do that as well. A lot of people adopt and appropriate these styles and it’s called high fashion, but when women of colour do it, it’s not. It’s the same with music: when people who aren’t of colour make music that is African or Caribbean-inspired, it’s called “tropical pop”, urban or just pop when people of colour create incredible pop music – inspired by their own heritage – it’s often put in the world music corner.The title track from my new album Too Bold is the message I want not only young black girls to carry with them, but anyone who has been told by society that they can’t achieve their goals while being their authentic selves: “Don’t let them tell you you’re too dark, don’t let them tell you you’re too smart, too large, too old, too much, too bold”. I made that song as a clarion call, relating not only to hair, but all the personal and global movements taking place in 2020. We’re at a moment in time where people are beginning to learn more about these incredible kings and queens, and respectable black African people who wore their natural hair in amazing ways – it’s just breaking into the mainstream. I put a lot of testimony from my own journey into my music, and I wanted to take part in this programme so that natural hair is ever more normalised. Wearing your hair and presenting yourself in the way that nature made you shouldn’t be such a risk – we need to accelerate the process of acceptance, recognition and respect.Growing up, it was really hard to find the confidence to broach these matters of identity without it feeling like the conversation wasn’t going to be a positive one. But this is a really wonderful time for people of colour to encourage each other to celebrate all of our identities, and also for people who are not of colour to appreciate our identities and immense creativity. My hair isn’t intimidating – it’s an expression of who I am.Hair Power: Me and My Afro will be screened on 27 October on Channel 4, 10.15pm.

Here’s the openers you should steer clear ofA man in a bar once said to me: “I think you’re on fire.” I’m not averse to a chat-up line as long as it’s funny or deployed with sufficient flair – in the age of online dating, a zinging opener is as much a necessity as an appreciation for the absurd.As I waited for the punchline, though, the man from the bar began open-palm slapping me on the back. It turns out, he wasn’t trying to be cute (he had a girlfriend who was watching in horror), it was just that my hair had caught alight on a candle and I was moments away from turning into a full human flame.You live, you learn. Sometimes, a man does just want to know if you’re tired, not because you’ve been running through his mind all day, but because you’re looking a bit wan.And sometimes you really are on fire.Here are some of the worst actual* pick-up lines I’ve heard, which, given that I’ve been single for, literally, ever, may possibly be the worst in the world.‘Pull your knees to your chest and relax’Nothing that sounds like an instruction from a gynaecologist will ever secure a date. See also: “I’m regularly screened for STIs”, which a GP once said to me on a dating app and which, tbf, in these difficult dating times, could be read as quite thoughtful, really.‘Would you restrain me in latex?’I did end up going on a date with this one because I thought it was a joke and played along, like “ha ha, sure”. In reality, he was a latex fetishist who turned up to our Thursday night drinks in Old Street with a gimp suit in his bag. I couldn’t tell who was more disappointed I thought I’d found someone with a good sense of humour, he thought he’d found a new mistress. I bought him an apology drink and said it wasn’t really my thing.It did make me wonder, though, perhaps we need clearer guidelines on when it’s appropriate to initiate a potential partner into your kinks and fetishes.My friends said that my tolerance for weirdness had obviously grown too high if I was responding to this.‘I think I saw you in Fitness First.’No one likes to be stalked, especially while blobbing around on a treadmill at 7am.‘I have a lot of money.’A few years ago, my friend and I had bumped into a guy we knew from university in a bar in Ibiza and ended up going back to his yacht (it was his parents’ yacht) for a “party”.They also invited a Russian model and a 22-year-old shot girl from Newcastle who was out there doing a season. The “party” turned out to be bad electronic dance music played from a phone in a pint glass and everyone speaking in hushed tones so as not to wake the boat’s skipper who’d have to get up and sail in a few hours.Perhaps out of boredom, the Russian model took off all her clothes and jumped in the sea. Then the six men who were actually staying on the boat all had a hissed debate about whose responsibility it was to go in after her. After it was decided that it wouldn’t be him, one of them sat next to me with a self-satisfied smile and whispered: “I have a lot of money”, and, honestly, I’m not sure what else I expected. (NB: the model was fine and enjoyed her swim).‘Do you eat fish?’Yes, I do eat fish. But this one came hot on the heels of the latex fetishist so, taking my friends’ advice, I did not reply.‘Do you want a swig of this gin?’… said a man as I waited for a taxi to take me home after a party. It was 3:45am and he was gulping from a bottle. At least it was a nice gin, I thought. I also thought he probably had a drinking problem, so that was that.‘Suck it.’So I’m never going to eat an ice lolly in public again.*I genuinely wish some of these were exaggerated, but they’re not.So why not try more than hi?

It will require patience and effort, but we are determined,“ they said.Last month, a Belgian court ruled in Princess Delphine’s favour and officially recognised her as Albert’s daughter, which the ageing monarch had fought to avoid since paternity rumours became public in 1998.Princess Delphine, 52, is an artist known for her quirky, sometimes outrageous, statues. Albert, 86, was king until 2013.The gathering on Sunday was followed by a reportedly warm meeting with her half-brother, the reigning King Phillipe, at the palace.Rumours about Albert and Princess Delphine’s mother, the aristocratic wife of a wealthy industrialist, had been circulating for years but Albert long refused to recognise her.Princess Delphine said going to court was all about getting family recognition and the love of a father who had cold-shouldered her and fought her in court. She said it made her life “most painful”.The photograph of Sunday’s encounter showed the three in front of a fireplace with cookies, untouched, on the table. All three sat apart and their smiles were not exuberant, yet it was a watershed moment for Belgium’s royal house.“During our encounter at the Belvedere Castle, each of us, with empathy and in serenity, was able to express their feelings and experiences,“ the statement said. “A new chapter had opened, rich in emotions, peace of mind, understanding and hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/461fea7114629b627c980660e910339b95eb997d/503_319_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=806b5305c6e66e48d3741568052d3ec3","title":"catalonia to invest in catalan nasa space agency and satellites","story":"Surprise announcement comes as region struggles to contain soaring Covid infectionsAs Catalonia faces the prospect of another coronavirus lockdown, the region’s government has announced it is investing €2.5m (£2.3m) to establish its own space agency and a further €18m in launching six communications satellites.The surprise announcement comes amid soaring Covid-19 infection rates and hospital admissions in the region, where health authorities are considering imposing a two-week lockdown. Bars and restaurants have been closed for 10 days and much of Catalonia’s vital hospitality sector is at a standstill.Jordi Puigneró, the Catalan digital policy minister, said on Tuesday that what he called the “Catalan Nasa” would “democratise space” and lead to the development of a service industry that “is still beyond imagination”.Puigneró rejected claims it was beyond the regional government’s legal competence to establish a space agency. He said Spain only controlled an area up to an altitude of 50km (31 miles), while the Catalan satellites will be 2,000km above the Earth.“Space is like international waters,” he said.Pedro Duque, Spain’s science minister and a former astronaut, has yet to comment on the proposal.Puigneró said the plan was for Catalonia to become a producer as well as a consumer of digital technology and predicted the agency’s work would create 1,200 jobs and an income of €300m within four years. The satellites are expected to be launched next year.He claimed there would be a return of €15 for every euro invested.The Catalan government says it needs the satellites to extend 5G cover, for observation and for its own services such as controlling forest fires.The news was greeted with disbelief on Twitter. “You are totally disconnected from reality,” one tweeter replied to Puigneró. “This already exists for free at a European level and it’s called Copernicus.”Another commented: “The Catalan republic conquers space in the midst of a pandemic, in a crisis of poverty, unemployment and recession.” The nano-satellites weigh only a few kilos and cost between €500,000 and €2m to manufacture. They operate at a lower altitude than conventional, geostationary satellites and as a result have a useful life of only about four years before gravity pulls them back down to Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5898851f26e7e19e51471004d11675c6bef9b1c8/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=663634fb336a7639ea418e1f60f2d0c6","title":"china sanctions major us defence companies after arms sales to taiwan","story":"Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Space \u0026amp Security and Raytheon named along with US officials who played a role in weapons salesChina will sanction several major defence companies in retaliation for multibillion dollar US arms sales to Taiwan, the foreign ministry has announced.Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Space \u0026amp Security and Raytheon were named as targets of the sanctions, as well as “the US iniduals and entities who played an egregious role”, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing on Monday, but did not provide further details.It came in response to confirmation of a ninth US arms sale to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy which Beijing considers a rogue Chinese province under its one-China principle, and has never ruled out retaking control of by force.Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed the $2.37bn purchase of the Boeing-made Harpoon Coastal Defense System, under the US’s 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which defines relations between the two governments and mandates the provision of defence materials and services to Taiwan. It followed last week’s approval of a $1.8bn weapons package sale, including missiles, rocket artillery, aerial reconnaissance sensors, and an August sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets.Lockheed Martin said foreign arms sales were “government-to-government transactions” and all of its international sales were “strictly regulated by the US government”. It said its China presence was limited.A spokesman for Boeing said the company remained committed to its partnership with China’s aviation community.Zhao called on the US to stop selling weapons to Taiwan or having military ties with it.“The US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns it,” he said.“We will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests.”The three China-US communiques were signed when the US cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan to recognise the People’s Republic of China more than four decades ago. The US does not formally recognise Beijing’s claim over Taiwan, and recently declassified Reagan-era cables detailed security assurances given at the same time, committing to continued arms sales with Taiwan without Beijing consultation.US relations with Taiwan have grown as they have soured with Beijing. This year the US has sent two government delegations to Taiwan, prompting Chinese threats of countermeasures. Washington adjusted its one-China policy in response to “the increasing threat posed by Beijing to peace and stability in the region” and its targeting of Taiwan.Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed the defence sales and said: “In the face of China’s military expansion and provocations, Taiwan will continue to strengthen the modernisation of its defensive capabilities and accelerate the improvement of its asymmetrical capabilities in order to maintain regional peace and stability.”Taiwan is building up its defence capabilities to discourage any possible cross-strait conflict. It has spent more than $1bn this year in scrambling jets to respond to increased Chinese military drills and sorties over the so-called “median line” in the Taiwan Strait.Dr Ou Si-fu, vice president of the Taiwanese defence think tank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said Taiwan won’t receive the defence materials for years, and the military needed time to train its personnel and in some cases build the infrastructure to house the assets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7fff03fd7547f8490e19bb19a794edb03807a1/0_274_8256_4957/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0296cd7b78cd37c04d031237015997cd","title":"covid vaccine uk oxford university astrazeneca works in all ages trials suggest","story":"Vaccine being trialled by Oxford University and AstraZeneca offers hope for all age groupsOne of the world’s leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in older adults as well as the young, its developers say, raising hopes of protection for those most vulnerable to the coronavirus that has caused social and economic chaos around the world.Neither Oxford University nor its commercial partner AstraZeneca would release the data from the early trials showing the positive effects, which are being submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. But AstraZeneca confirmed the basic findings about the vaccine it calls AZD1222, which were shared at a closed academic meeting.The phase 2 trials have shown that people over the age of 56 – and some over 70 – produced the same sort of antibody response as younger volunteers. Whether older people would be protected has always been a key question for the vaccines being developed. The body’s natural immune system and therefore its ability to fight any virus weakens with age, which is why the Covid death rate rises in older people.The data also shows that fewer side-effects – referred to by the scientists as “reactogenicity” – were reported in the older volunteers, which is encouraging, although it could mean fewer of them reported issues such as a sore arm.“It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher. The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” said an AstraZeneca spokesman.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people. However, few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. They may instead reduce the severity of illness, so that people avoid hospital and deaths are reduced. They may also not last, so that boosters will be needed.AstraZeneca said it hoped the vaccine may be ready for limited use within the coming months. “We anticipate efficacy read-outs from phase 23 trials between now and the end of the year, and if approved within countries, doses of the potential vaccine could be available for use before the end of the year,” said the spokesperson.However, most experts outside the company, and the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, expect it not to be available until 2021. Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year, Hancock told the BBC: “I don’t rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible rollout, mostly in the first half of 2021. AstraZeneca has committed to mass manufacturing and has a capacity of 3bn doses – which equates to enough for 1.5 billion people globally getting the two-dose vaccine. It has also signed deals with manufacturers in other countries, such as India.The final trials (phase 3), looking to see a significant difference in the numbers of deaths between those vaccinated and those who are not, are taking place in six countries. Trials in the US, which were paused after a volunteer in the UK became ill, have resumed. The other countries participating are South Africa, Brazil, Japan and India.The vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with one from Pfizer and BioNTech.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral-vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, cautioned that no conclusions about the efficacy of the vaccine should be drawn until the data had been published.“In order to comment properly on this we need to see the data,” he said. “It is encouraging that the investigators suggest that the immune responses measured in the blood seem to show efficacy both above, as well as below, age 70. The later phase trials are needed to see if the immune responses translate into clinical efficacy in preventing infection. These will involve much larger numbers and it is wise to not be too optimistic until those trials have completed.”Raised antibody levels in the blood indicated but did not guarantee protection from the virus multiplying in the body, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5603a3dc4da66b8421ea4e95d4e2c310ad537187/0_223_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33384254892e3a7637c4f256c1c08c9a","title":"doug ford ontario caucus member photographed indoors mask","story":"Sam Oosterhoff was part of large group gathered in banquet hall without masks or practicing social distancingOntario’s premier, Doug Ford, has come under fire for refusing to demote a scofflaw member of his caucus who was photographed without a mask at a large indoor gathering – even as the regional government pleads with residents to follow public health rules during the pandemic.Sam Oosterhoff, a parliamentary assistant to the province’s education minister, posted pictures online this weekend of a large group gathered in a banquet hall. None of the nearly 40 attendees were seen wearing masks or practicing physical distancing.The photographs – and the evidence of a flagrant breach of the provincial government’s public health messaging – prompted outrage. Oosterhoff subsequently deleted the post and apologized for not wearing a mask. He also told reporters the event was in a region of Ontario where gatherings of up to 50 people indoors are still permitted. But health officials require masks and physical distancing while inside.“He came out and apologized. Hey, guys, everyone makes mistakes,” Ford told reporters . “I’m a strong believer, you make a mistake, you go out and apologize and say it’s not going to happen again. I accept that.”But a post late Monday evening from the restaurant where the event was hosted told a different story.“There was a group in last week, that has caused some concern,” Betty’s Restaurant wrote in a post on Facebook. “This group was reminded several times that they were required to wear masks when not seated at their table. Unfortunately they chose not to follow posted rules about wearing masks and distancing. We can remind guests but we cannot strong-arm them into following rules.”The premier’s office reiterated its support for Oosterhoff Tuesday.But the photographs – and his support for Oosterhoff – put Ford in a difficult position as his government tries to tackle the second wave of the virus.Canada’s most populous province logged more than 1,000 new cases in a single day on Sunday, and outbreaks are surging in long-term care homes, prompting fresh appeals for the public to follow health protocols.Ford has admitted he’s battling isions within his government over how quickly to roll out new restrictions.“I always say I gotta listen to the docs, I always will, and the science, but in saying that, I have to listen to the small business owners,” Ford said Monday, adding he’s trying to find a “happy balance”.Opposition leader Andrew Horwath of the New Democratic party told reports on Monday that the premier’s messaging on public health measures has been “so inconsistent and so unclear” that Oosterhoff “literally posed for a photo where he violated public health guidelines”.“So why is the premier’s own team challenging, and outright ignoring, his directions?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81673619b9e30ca09d499bb0117c76e59fff1492/890_577_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bb049bcbfcc90bfe0b96af000d556a0","title":"i got a whole new mindset the health secrets of people who got much fitter in lockdown","story":"Many of us have struggled to maintain our fitness in 2020 – but not everyone. Here, four people explain how they improved their sleep patterns, diet and exercise regimesBefore Covid-19, an ordinary evening for Tim Ludford, a charity worker, looked something like this: after-work drinks with colleagues an Uber home a takeaway. “Not healthy takeaways, either,” says Ludford, 37, from London. He would polish off a curry for two people before nailing a bag of Maltesers or a packet of biscuits.Ludford’s relationship with food began to deteriorate after the death from cancer of his father in 2013. “I was unhappy, first of all, and I was bingeing on food and alcohol as a coping mechanism,” he says. “A lot of it was related to my dad, but I was also stuck in a rut and food was an easy way to make myself feel good.” By the time lockdown was introduced, he was severely obese, with a BMI of 40. (A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, according to the NHS.) “Sometimes I’d do crazy things,” he says. “If I was on the way to meet someone for dinner, I’d go to KFC on the way. And then I’d eat dinner as well.”Then Covid-19 hit. Ludford was too scared of the transmission risk to order a takeaway. The pubs were not open. “I started cooking at home,” he says. “Soups, salads – healthy stuff.” He was furloughed and began to struggle with anxiety, in part related to the pandemic, but also related to his health. His dad had had a heart attack before he died, and Ludford began to panic that he would, too. The sudden death of a friend from a heart condition, in April, sent him to a dark place. “It was like all this anxiety I had been pushing away, about my health and my weight, suddenly opened a crack,” he says. “And, because I was on furlough, I had time to focus on it. Everything fell apart. My brain decided that this was my comeuppance: I was going to have a heart attack, as payback for the irresponsible lifestyle I’d been leading.”Ludford spoke to a GP about his anxiety, who recommended exercise and referred him for counselling. So, he started walking: “2km became 5km became 10km,” he says. And he exercised to videos he found on YouTube. At first, he could not manage a single burpee, but after a few months, he was flinging himself on and off the floor with ease. “The exercise was the only thing that really helped me to get a handle on my anxiety,” he says. “Exercise kept the wheels on the bus.” Seven months on, Ludford has lost 34kg (5st 5lb) and is no longer severely obese. But the weight loss is secondary to his mental wellbeing – he feels like himself again. “Everything came together at the same time,” he says. “Lockdown was the trigger.”While lockdown was a period of indulgence for many of us – who can blame anyone for looking at a world in freefall, with political leaders squabbling like children, and reaching for the biscuit tin? – the enforced stillness of 2020 gave some people the time and headspace to embrace a more active lifestyle. Freed from the shackles of the commute and the lure of late-night pub sessions, an overhaul was in reach. Fiona Gillison, a chartered psychologist and behaviour-change expert at the University of Bath, says: “The pandemic reduced the barriers that many people have to leading healthier lifestyles – by giving them more time at home or dedicated time to exercise.”Gillison believes that the fact the government made exercise one of the only exemptions from the Covid-19 restrictions during lockdown helped reinforce the notion that it was a priority, even during a pandemic. “We were allowed out for one hour a day for exercise, and that was one of the only things we were allowed to do,” she says. “That’s quite strong public health messaging. In effect, the government was saying: ‘Look, this is worth leaving the house for this is worth the risk.’” Exercise also became social: families traipsing out for walks together, friends meeting for a hike.Plus, during lockdown, there was not much else to do. Sue Wild, 67, a retired midwife from Birmingham, says: “I thought to myself: what else am I doing? I might as well try to get fit.” Wild has never been an exercise fan: she completed the NHS’s Couch to 5K app a few years ago, for a bet, but it did not stick. This summer, for want of anything to do, she downloaded it again and started running once more. “It was strange,” she says. “I never enjoyed it before. But I think, because I’m not going out as much, it’s nice to have a bit of time to look around and feel like things are normal.”The pandemic is more dangerous for older people, obese people and those with underlying health conditions. “I know that Covid-19 isn’t going anywhere,” says Wild, who is just outside the age bracket (70-plus) in which she would be most at risk from the virus. “So, I have to be the fittest that I can be. I just feel like, if I did get it, I’d want to give myself the best shot possible for a good recovery.”She is not alone. A recent study from University College London, which tracked 5,395 people via a smartphone app, found that over-65s were among the most active of all the groups surveyed throughout lockdown and increased their physical activity levels the most once the lockdown restrictions were eased. It was also the only age group to become more active during the pandemic than beforehand.In July, prompted largely by the prime minister’s spell in intensive care – Johnson believes he was hospitalised with the virus due to his weight – the government announced an anti-obesity strategy. (Critics pointed out that the measures did little to address the structural reasons for obesity, such as inequality.) The messaging appears to be working, at least for Ludford. “I am very aware of how obesity is a risk factor,” he says. “That was a big motivation – to get down to a healthy BMI.”For Shae Eccleston, 42, a consultant from Dunstable in Bedfordshire, it was a way to sort out her chronic insomnia, not just for her own health, but so that she could be there for her family. Five members of her family fell ill with Covid-19 at the same time – her mum, her grandfather, her grandmother and two aunts. “I was doing a lot of supermarket shops and making sure they were taken care of,” she says. “I just knew that I could not afford to get sick. I had to be resting. I couldn’t afford to be knocked down as well.”Before the pandemic, she averaged two to four hours’ sleep a night. “I’ve always been bad at sleeping. My mum says that, even when I was a baby, I was always awake. It was a good night, if I fell asleep before the sun came up,” she says. But her family’s brush with Covid-19 – thankfully, everyone pulled through – was a wakeup call. Now, she puts her phone on Do Not Disturb, listens to ASMR videos, and has made her bedroom a screen-free zone. (Previously, she would often work on her laptop in bed.) “I’ve been getting a good six hours’ sleep a night,” she says. “To other people, that’s nothing. But it’s huge for me.”It is easier to form better habits if your lifestyle has been upended. “Covid disrupted all of our routines,” says Gillison. “When you have to create a new routine, your old habits are disrupted and you’re more in charge of how you shape your own life. That will play a role in why people may be embracing healthier behaviours.” Covid-19 acted as a jolt for many. Ludford had tried dry January and health kicks before, but nothing stuck. “Suddenly, going on as normal wasn’t an option,” he says. “Before, I’d been able to live a certain lifestyle. And then this big interruption came along.” Eccleston, too, thinks she would have continued in her old ways – late-night phone calls to friends, working in her bedroom until the early hours – were it not for the shock of lockdown. “Suddenly, everything changed and I got a new mindset,” she says.When so much is out of your hands, exercise is something you can control. “There’s something about the sense of autonomy you get from exercise,” says Gillison. “You’re doing it for your own reasons, rather than because someone told you to.” With Ludford on furlough, exercise gave him a sense of drive and purpose. “I’ve felt so stuck this year,” he says. “You can’t plan ahead in your life the way you want to or are used to. Exercise has enabled me to focus on a series of goals that I can achieve.”For many people, upping their exercise helped them deal with the stress and anxiety of living through a pandemic. “I know my own mental health quite well,” says Tom Firth, 33, a teacher from Yorkshire. “If I don’t do something productive with my day, I start to dislike myself.” Before lockdown, he often worked 12-hour shifts, treating the summer holidays as a period for recharging. “I’d think that I should be healthier, but I never had the time, so I just gradually ignored it and got more and more unfit,” he says.But he could feel his mental health deteriorating, so he got on his exercise bike. Firth set himself the goal of cycling 1,000 miles a month, tracking his miles on a spreadsheet. During the Tour de France, he cycled along now, he watches Parks and Recreation on the bike. Firth credits his exercise regimen with giving him the resilience to get through the pandemic. He has also lost 20kg. “Exercising for an hour a day has done wonders for my mental health,” he says. “It releases all these lovely chemicals. It’s literally addictive.”Will these habits stick when people return to their old lifestyles? Firth thinks so: even though the new school year has started, he is keeping to his routine. “Initially, I was only doing this because I had nothing to do,” he says. “But it went on for so long that it became a habit. And I’m proud of that.” The best way to make anything stick is to build it into your everyday routine. “It is much easier to do something over the long term if it becomes a habit,” says Gillison. “Habits occur when you’ve already done the decision-making, so the ‘cue’ to act becomes an automatic part of your day.”She also recommends that people embark on diet or fitness changes with friends, for motivation and accountability. “Social support is key,” Gillison says. “Finding someone to do the activity with, in person or virtually, or even just showing interest and encouraging you to keep going, is helpful,” she says.After gaining 3.6kg during lockdown, Wild has been following the NHS weight loss plan, a diet devised by doctors to help people lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate, with her husband. “I’ve tried to lose weight before, but it was a nightmare, making two meals and having all this tempting food around,” she says. “What’s been great this time is having my husband do it with me. I want to get fit for my older age,” Wild says. “I don’t feel old at all. But I know that Covid is worse if you’re older, and overweight.”Gillison warns that health anxiety is not in itself enough to sustain a long-term change: it is easy to become complacent once the initial alarm has worn off. “The public will hear the message that Covid is more dangerous for the obese and it will get them out of the door a few times,” she says. “But unless they find something they enjoy doing, it will be a short-term fix.”The most important way to make fitness a habit is to make it fun. “We are only able to make ourselves do something for a short amount of time,” says Gillison. “It’s hard to stick at something you find unpleasant, plus you don’t get the benefits in terms of the sense of wellbeing when you’re doing something you don’t like. So, if lockdown was a time of experimentation with various activities, pick the one you enjoyed.”Ludford is confident that he won’t slip back into old ways. “I’ve seen such a huge change in my life,” he says. “Covid gave me the opportunity to focus on the things that were undermining my mental health. I’m not going to go back to how things were before. It’s been transformational.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7be1283cf4b080dda6fffc1046754f6d06e4d19/0_6_4501_2701/master/4501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaf9fd4f10616c76153a0d94cb1a326e","title":"structural racism led to worse covid impact on bame groups report","story":"Minority ethnic people in UK were ‘overexposed, under protected, stigmatised and overlooked’, review findsStructural racism led to the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, a review by Doreen Lawrence has concluded.The report, commissioned by Labour, contradicts the government’s adviser on ethnicity, Dr Raghib Ali, who last week dismissed claims that inequalities within government, health, employment and the education system help to explain why Covid-19 killed disproportionately more people from minority ethnic communities.Lady Lawrence’s review found BAME people are over-represented in public-facing industries where they cannot work from home, are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and have been put at risk by the government’s alleged failure to facilitate Covid-secure workplaces.She demanded that the government set out an urgent winter plan to tackle the disproportionate impact of Covid on BAME people and ensure comprehensive ethnicity data is collected across the NHS and social care.The report, entitled An Avoidable Crisis, also criticises politicians for demonising minorities, such as when Donald Trump used the phrase “the Chinese virus”.Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, was commissioned to lead the review by the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, after it became clear minority ethnic people were being disproportionately hit by the pandemic. More than a third of all critically ill Covid-19 patients up to August were from an ethnic minority, according to government statistics.In the report’s foreword, Lawrence, a Labour peer, said minority ethnic people had been “overexposed, under protected, stigmatised and overlooked”. “This has been generations in the making. The impact of Covid is not random, but foreseeable and inevitable – the consequence of decades of structural injustice, inequality and discrimination that blights our society. We are in the middle of an avoidable crisis. And this report is a rallying cry to break that clear and tragic pattern,” she said.The report comes days after Ali suggested it was time to stop using ethnicity when deciding who needed help. “The problem with focusing on ethnicity as a risk factor is that it misses the very large number of non-ethnic minority groups, so whites basically, who also live in deprived areas and overcrowded housing and with high risk occupations,” he said.The equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, said the increased risk appeared to be because of “a range of socio-economic and geographical factors” but warned the risks “remained unexplained for some groups” and further analysis was planned for the coming months.In today’s 26-page report, Lawrence has made 20 immediate and long-term recommendations to protect those most at risk from the virus and reduce societal inequalities.As part of an urgent plan for the winter, the government should remind employers they have a legal duty to record Covid-19 deaths caused by occupational exposure, the report said.Employers should be legally required to publish their Covid-19 risk assessments on a central government portal and must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), Lawrence concluded.Ministers must also suspend the “no recourse to public funds” rule, Lawrence said, which prevents some migrants accessing state assistance, and give support to any person struggling to self-isolate at home.In the longer term, the government should remove barriers to accessing health services and information, collect comprehensive data on ethnicity and reform the immigration system, the review said.In June, Public Health England’s report on Covid-19 deaths confirmed the risk of dying among those diagnosed with Covid-19 was higher in those in BAME groups than in white ethnic groups.After accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, it found that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity were at most risk, with about twice the risk of death compared with people of white British ethnicity.The review called for a plan to tackle a rise in hate crime and stigmatisation of minority ethnic communities, particularly among politicians.It criticised a tweet from the Conservative MP Craig Whittaker, who wrote in July: “If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases, the vast majority, but not by any stretch of the imagination all areas, it is the BAME communities that are not taking this seriously enough.”Starmer said the report must be a “turning point”, promising that the next Labour government will implement a race equality act to tackle structural racial inequality.“Government ministers should absorb this report and act immediately. Failure to do so will leave many of our fellow citizens badly exposed over the winter,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “The current evidence shows that a range of factors result in different groups being at an increased risk of infection and death from Covid-19 – from exposure in the workplace to pre-existing health conditions.“For this reason we must be careful to identify the root causes of the disparities we’re seeing and not assume they are evidence of discrimination or unfair treatment in public services like the NHS. Indeed, many of the factors identified in the report affect non-ethnic groups as well.“We will continue taking this work forward to ensure that we do everything we can to protect those most at risk”• This article was amended on 27 October 2020 to clarify that as a peer Doreen Lawrence goes by the honorific Lady Lawrence, not “Dame Doreen Lawrence”, as an earlier version had it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62b3e16fa5219b96a4561c2e16697a4ad95bf79/121_796_4051_2432/master/4051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=014c1c30055cb346ff9a171d88901529","title":"uk black lives matter activists not behind attempt to use name for political party","story":"Movement denies involvement in application to register party under name Black Lives MatterActivists from Black Lives Matter’s UK affiliate have said they were not behind an attempt to register the name as a new UK political party.A notice of the application to register a UK-wide political party under the name Black Lives Matter was published by the Electoral Commission on Monday. Sources from Black Lives Matter’s UK affiliate – now officially registered as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK – denied involvement. Speaking on behalf of the group, Lemara Francis said: “BLM is proud to be a political organisation, but has no plans to set up a political party.“BLM UK launched in 2016. We have been doing grassroots community work and direct action across the UK for the last four years. We are part of the global BLM network working to end racism and anti-black violence.“This year, the surge in support for Black Lives Matter has seen a range of new iniduals and groups acting under the BLM banner. Not all of them share the goals of the wider BLM movement.”There was further confusion after several rightwing newspapers quoted denials from activists organising under the name Black Lives Matter who were not from the movement’s officially recognised UK affiliate.  has also contacted a number of other groups organising under the name to ask if they were behind the registration.According to the Electoral Commission’s notice of application, as well as using the Black Lives Matter name, various proposed descriptions for the party include: Black Lives MatterAll Lives Matter Black Lives Matter for the GLA Black Lives Matter Great Britain Black Lives Matter (United Kingdom) The Black Lives Matterparty Black Lives Matter party of Wales Black Lives Matter party of Scotland.A spokesperson for the commission said that an application to register a political party could not be made without providing details of a financial scheme to fund it, a constitution setting out its organisation and structure, details of who would fill the roles of party leader, treasurer, nominating officer, and at least two other officials, and a non-refundable £150 application submission fee.Black Lives Matter first emerged in the US in 2013 as a response to police and vigilante killings of black men and youths. Various groups have been organising in the UK under the slogan since around 2016, but there is only one recognised affiliate of the US movement in the country.In September, that group officially registered as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK – with the legal status a condition of its receiving £1.2m in donations that had been donated to the cause via a GoFundMe appeal. The name change was partly down to a number of companies having already registered under the various permutations of the slogan.Last week BLM UK activists said that despite the change of name they would continue to organise under the Black Lives Matter slogan.

That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Legislation will require financial advisers to ask for environmental and social preferencesF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland has \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo about siting and scale of proposed development\u0026lsquoWhat often gets overlooked is positive and tangible change occurring at farm level\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Co Kerry is notable for exotic species escaped into the wild from \u0026lsquobig house gardens\u0026rsquoThe Hidden Lakes of Connemara offers \u0026lsquoa tribute to a fascinating landscape\u0026rsquoYoung author and his family live as \u0026lsquoclose as otters\u0026rsquo at the foot of the Mourne MountainsMichael Viney: Mola mola, with its appetite for jellyfish, are in warmer Irish watersClimate change has \u0026lsquogreatly enabled\u0026rsquo a national surge in the range of deerMichael Viney: Despite the threat of disease, Ireland\u0026rsquos living elms can still surpriseMichael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGettyIreland has moved to a second national lockdown under a so-called “soft” Level 5 restrictions strategy for six weeks from Thursday October 22nd until December 1st . It is far from soft, but what exactly does it mean for everyday life?Can I travel outside my county?Yes as long as it\u0027s within 5km of your home. Under Level 5 you will be asked to stay at home, with the exception that you can exercise within 5km of your home.There will be a penalty for movement outside 5km of home, with exemptions to this for essential work and essential purposes.What are deemed essential purposes for travel outside the 5km limit?Shopping for essential items, travelling to and from work where work involves providing an essential service, attending medical appointments and collecting medicines and other health products, farming purposes and to take school-aged children to permitted training.It also includes vital family reasons such as a wedding or funeral, visiting a grave and providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people and those who live alone as part of an extended household, known as a support bubble.More details on sports below.Can I have any visitors to my home?No. There are to be no visitors to your home or garden.As mentioned, there is the concept of an extended household, known as a support bubble, for defined categories of iniduals to support those at risk of social isolation andor mental ill-health. It will be possible for those in such circumstances to nominate one other household with whom they can mix.Could I meet up with family or a friend away from my home, in a park?It is possible to meet with one other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for exercise.Large social or family gatherings shouldn’t take place in other settings, except for weddings or funerals.So weddings aren’t cancelled?Weddings can still go ahead, with up to 25 guests allowed to attend a wedding ceremony and reception.Are organised indoor or outdoor gatherings allowed to take place such as conferences, events in theatres or other arts events?No organised indoor or outdoor events can take place under Level 5. Museums, galleries and other cultural attractions all remain closed.Parks and outdoor playgrounds can remain open with protective measures in place.Will schools close?The Government’s plan says recommendations for schools, crèches, higher and adult education under Level 5 will be based on the “situation and evidence at time”.The Government has said that schools and crèches will remain open over the next six weeks “in line with current Nphet advice”.Is all sport cancelled?Under the Level 5 plan, inidual training only can take place. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools close.No adult training or matches should take place, with the exception of professional, elite sports and inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and greyhound racing, which are being permitted to continue behind closed doors.In addition, in recognition of the impact of restrictions on children and young people, non-contact training can continue for school-aged children, outdoors in pods of 15.What happens to pubs and restaurants?Bars, cafés, restaurants and wet pubs can only offer takeaway or delivery. Nightclubs, discos and casinos will remain closed. Wet pubs in Dublin also remain closed.Are retail outlets, hairdressersbarbers allowed to stay open?Essential retail is only allowed to stay open and face coverings must continue to be worn. Some of the essential retail outlets permitted to remain open includes businesses selling foods and beverages on a takeaway basis, newspaper sales, supermarkets and pharmacies and chemists.Outlets selling products necessary for the essential upkeep and functioning of places of residence and businesses are also allowed to remain open, as well as businesses selling health, medical or orthopaedic goods.Fuel service stations and heating fuel providers, businesses selling items for the health and welfare of animals, laundries and drycleaners, banks post offices and credit unions can also remain open.Outlets selling safety supplies , hardware outlets, businesses providing repair and maintenance of mechanically propelled vehicles or bicycles can also remain open.Optician and optometrists, hearing services, businesses selling office products and outlets selling electrical and communications technology are permitted to remain open on an emergency basis.All other retail and personal services close.What about religious services and funerals?Religious services will be held online while places of worship remain open for private prayer. Up to 25 mourners can attend a funeral.Can hotels and similar accommodation stay open?They are open only for those with “essential non-social and non-tourist purposes”.Do over-70s and medically vulnerable people have to cocoon?Those aged over 70 years and over and the medically vulnerable should exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home.It is recommended that they stay at home as much as possible, limit engagement to a very small network for short periods of time, while remaining physically distanced.When exercising outdoors, it is important to maintain two metres distance from others and wash hands on returning home, the advice states. It is recommended to shop during designated hours only, while wearing a face covering, and to avoid public transport.Can I visit a relative in a nursing home?Visits to long-term residential care facilities continue to be suspended under Level 5 aside from “critical and compassionate circumstances”.What about public transport?Face coverings must continue to be worn on public transport. People should only use public transport if they are essential workers or for essential purposes only. People are advised to walk or cycle where possible.Public transport capacity will be restricted to 25 per cent to allow essential workers to get to work.

In a statement given to Cork’s Echo Live, she said she did not believe that the Green Party “engaged on this issue with a full understanding of its seriousness, nor with the close attention and careful handling that it deserves.”Ms Bogue also said she had pointed out the need for institutional change in the party after she had previously highlighted issues around misogyny “but the active hostility towards women continues.”In a statement, five Green Party members of Cork City Council and Cork County Council, said Ms Bogue resigned late last week.“We know her decision to do so was not taken lightly. Lorna has give most of her adult life to the Green Party. She was central to rebuilding the party when it was at its lowest electoral ebb.”The five councillors said this was the case “nationally and here in Cork.”“The party owes her thanks for her energy and conviction. In particular, for expanding the party’s prescence and visibility on issues of social justice.”“The social and environment challenges facing our city and world go beyond politics. Lorna is a trusted colleague and a friend for many years. We share the same vision for our city, one that extends beyond the artificial boundaries of party membership.”The five colleagues said that they would continue to work together on the council.The news follows confirmation at the weekend that the chairs of two groups in the Green Party had also resigned from their positions and left the party claiming they have been left “dismayed” by decisions taken since it went into Government.Tiernan Mason quit the Queer Greens and Tara Gilsenan stood down from the Young Greens with both claiming they were “bullied and harassed” by party members and representatives.They published a letter on social media, saaying they had departed with immediate effect.“We had hoped that we could fight to make a difference and to hold the Green Party to account, but in our short time as chairpersons, we have realised that our efforts have been in vain and that the concerns we have raised have been going unheeded,” they wrote.“To that end, we feel that we are no longer able to represent these affiliate groups of the Green Party.They signed off the letter warning that history will “not be kind” to the party as it

What we have now is not a loophole. It’s bad law and it’s why the legislation sorely needs redrafting,” he said.\u0027If successfully argued, the offender is back on the road despite the vast number of points on his licence. \u0027It\u0027s so simple.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"iran says would welcome us return nuclear deal","story":"Iran has said it would welcome the United States returning to the 2015 nuclear deal following the presidential election, but only if it paid damages and offered commitments not breach the agreement again.We would welcome such a decision by any president, government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters in Tehran.Donald Trump, the US president, withdrew in 2018 from the deal Iran reached with world powers over its nuclear programme, but Tehran insists it does not favour either candidate in the November 3 election.It makes no difference to us which president in America decides to return to the deal, Mr Rabiei said. But the United States would need to to provide other guarantees it will not repeat the actions that led to its withdrawal.Since withdrawing from the nuclear agreement, the United States has imposed a series of punishing economic sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at forcing Tehran to agree to a stricter deal. Sanctions announced earlier this month aimed to isolate Iran from the global financial system, something experts said could hinder Iran’s ability to buy food and medicine, despite exemptions for humanitarian goods. In the latest round announced last Thursday, the United States imposed sanctions on Iranian military commanders and media outlets in response to what it said was a “brazen” attempt to interfere in the election.With Iran’s economy collapsing and its currency declining in value, Washington should be ready to be held responsible for the damages it has caused the people of Iran during the time it withdrew, Mr Rabiei said.Mr Trump’s challenger Joe Biden, who is currently leading in opinion polls, supported the nuclear deal when he was vice president under Barack Obama.

Well, living in Manchester, where we labour under the toughest set of restrictions, it\u0027s hard not to start every conversation this way.We bemoan not seeing loved ones who live outside our support bubble (even in the back garden, for goodness\u0027 sake).And remember the days of going to the pub? Forget it. In a move that has paralysed the local hospitality sector, nearly 2,000 pubs and bars have closed. Places which never had the good fortune to reap benefits of Eat Out To Help Out through lack of recourse to a substantial meal menu.How long will it be like this? How many more will lose jobs or face the prospect of watching their businesses crumble?It\u0027s what, above all else, damns the Government tier strategy. The sense that we are being left in a state of existential drift with no obvious plans to timetable our way out of the misery is palpable. The old adage of what to do when going through hell (keep going) rings hollow. We keep going without an end in sight – the way in well scripted, the way out a blank page.Even those who are working – whilst admitting  their fortunate to be able to do so –  feel leaden despair at this lack of direction. Of the sense, as my friend says, of nothing to look forward to. We need a roadmap to analgise the suffering.Only the other day, I happened to walk past the special occasion wear section in a city centre department store. The dresses hovered from their hangers like sparkly shrouds – a glittering memorial to the parties and weddings which give life colour and which we so lazily took for granted.The urgency to address the problem of a timetable is only compounded by the fact more areas will soon be under Tier 3. Warrington is the latest to  be added. Nottingham and parts of the surrounding county will join Tier 3 on Thursday. That means about eight million people in England will be living under the toughest restrictions.Perhaps some succour should be taken from the fact that more than 50 Tory MPs have now written to the Prime Minister calling for a clear road map out of lockdown restrictions in Northern England. The letter from the Northern Research Group states that the pandemic threatens Boris Johnson\u0027s pledge to level-up. They have also called for an economic recovery plan for the region, arguing it had been hardest hit by the virus.Inevitably No 10 parrots that the Government is committed to levelling up across the country.Is it cliché to badge the North as a metropolitan blindspot? Well, you only have to look at the map to see why there is geographical foundation in the political case. Though don\u0027t turn away if you live South of Watford Gap. After Sadiq Khan\u0027s Faustian deal over Tier 2, how long before London is placed under the highest level of restrictions too?Fundamentally lockdown is unsustainable. We stay in, so numbers go down. As soon as we taste liberty, Covid hunts for new prey. How is any business able to survive let alone thrive? Is the calendar just a place to script cancellations? It\u0027s why we need a pand-exit plan. Clear criteria for moving tiers. And above all, a repurposing of the message. That opening up the economy goes hand in hand – sorry – with an emphasis on stringent hygiene and the need to be sensible.Meanwhile stress focused protection for the vulnerable: although  give iniduals agency to decide. As 83-year-old Maureen Eames, a great-grandmother from Barnsley, told BBC News, I don’t give a sod....I’ve not got all that many years left of me and I’m not going to be fastened in a house when the government have got it all wrong.)It\u0027s a message for all of us in Tier 3.

Her family say she was then held incommunicado until she was granted a prison visit in late August after refusing food for six days. Since then the 31-year-old has not been allowed phone calls and her parents have only been allowed to visit her twice, most recently on Monday, her sister said. “She told them that once they leave she’s starting a hunger strike again until she gets her basic rights,” Lina al-Hathloul said. “She cried during the whole session saying that they’re really mistreating her and she’s the only prisoner not having calls.”While in detention her family says Ms Hathloul has been subjected to electric shocks, whippings and sexual abuse.  Saudi authorities say Riyadh does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture.Lina al-Hathloul said she was concerned about the deteriorating mental state of her sister, who has been in solitary confinement for most of her detention. “We’re not used to seeing Loujain like this, crying, being negative and not having any hope,” she said.Ms Hathloul attracted global attention in 2014 when she was jailed for 73 days after filming herself attempting to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates, where she had legally obtained a driving license.In 2015 she was barred from standing as a candidate in local elections, the first that women were allowed to contest.Her arrest in a sweeping crackdown on dissidents in 2018 was interpreted by critics of the kingdom as a move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assumed credit for the kingdom’s modernising drive and control the narrative around the lifting of the decades-old women’s driving ban.In August last year, Ms Hathloul’s siblings said authorities had offered to release her if she agreed to retract her allegations of torture and sexual harassment.As the women detained alongside Ms Hathloul in 2018 have since been freed, her family and advocates say she had been singled out for additional punishment. “The only explanation for that is that she’s been the most vocal, so she’s being punished,” said Adam Coogle, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa ision.“They see the only way to silence her is to break her,” said Lina al-Hathloul. “They don’t want to release a strong woman who will continue everything she has been doing for years.”Saudi Arabia insists it is committed to women’s rights and last week virtually hosted a G20-linked women’s conference, which was criticised for whitewashing the kingdom’s rights record.  “Empowering women is a priority to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the foreign ministry said in a tweet ahead of the Women20 summit, which aims to advance gender equality in G20 negotiations. “Saudi holding a women’s rights conference while five high-profile women rights activists are detained is the height of hypocrisy,” said Mr Coogle.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tensions secularism islam deepening france","story":"Following the murder of a French teacher for showing his pupils cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims because they depict the Prophet Mohammed, President Macron reaffirmed his country’s belief in secularism, or laïcité. In doing so he asserted that Islam was “a religion that is in crisis today all over the world”.This has angered the leaders of Muslim countries, notably Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, who has urged a boycott of French goods on his people. This tension between secularism and Islam has become ever more pronounced in recent years, especially in France.Five years ago, a dozen staff members of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were killed for publishing the very cartoons that cost teacher Samuel Paty his life earlier this month. The murder emphasised the gulf in France as a majority seek to reassert their traditional secularism. Laïcité was originally designed to counter the power of the Roman Catholic Church.Perhaps President Macron might have better phrased his statement by directing it not at Islam itself but at the leaders of some Muslim countries. President Erdogan, in particular, pursues policies in the Middle East and North Africa that foment the sentiments on which radicals feed. Rather than attack a fellow Nato member, he could more usefully denounce those who perpetrate violence in the name of the religion he follows.For his part, Mr Macron risks misunderstanding what he is dealing with by vowing to build a variety of Islam “that can be compatible with the Enlightenment”. Yet laïcité goes beyond the practices in other Western countries, like the UK, which do allow a public role for different religions. France might yet need to find a halfway house.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"31 mps including jeremy corbyn","story":"News MPs including Jeremy Corbyn demand change to pay Tier  workers minimum wageLabour left-wingers have written to the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding a \"floor\" in his Job Support Scheme from November  to ensure no one is left on less than minimum wagemirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsJeremy Corbyn is among  Labour left-wingers who have struck out in a letter to the Chancellor \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But that means many low-paid staff will get less than minimum wage - with those over  getting as little as £. an hour.The left-wing MPs - who also include John McDonnell and Diane Abbott - demand a “floor” so that no worker on the JSS will get less than the minimum wage for their age bracket.They write: “No-one should ever be expected to live on less than the minimum wage. Without such a minimum wage floor to the Job Support Scheme during this pandemic many of our constituents will receive pay that is completely inadequate to meet even their basic needs. “Even before the pandemic many of them were struggling to make ends meet because of low pay.” Labour MP and Corbyn ally Richard Burgon, who arranged the letter, said: “It’s called the National Minimum Wage for a reason - the Government needs to act to ensure that nobody is paid less than it.The letter appears to go further than Labour’s front bench, which is demanding at least % wage support for anyone hit.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Labour would reform the JSS and Universal Credit to “guarantee those on the lowest incomes don’t pay the price for new restrictions.”He added: “We’ve called for a raft of changes to Universal Credit that would improve the level of support and expand it to many people who currently don’t get it.” More than million people in England are living under Tier  or  restrictions - with .million under the worst Tier  by this weekend. Those whose venues are hit but not shut completely can continue working part-time, for between % and % of their usual salary. Ministers say workers can have their pay topped up by Universal Credit - but not everyone qualies, such as those with a high-earning partner or more than £, in savings. The Treasury was contacted for comment. The letter in full th October  Dear Chancellor, A Minimum Wage Floor in the Job Support Scheme Minimum wage workers in workplaces forced to shut in very high virus areas will, from next week, be paid just two-thirds of the minimum wage under the Job Support Scheme. For workers aged  and over, this will be as low as just £. per hour, equivalent to the minimum wage level of  years ago. For younger workers it will be even less. Many workers in businesses not forced to close also face being paid less than the minimum wage. No-one should ever be expected to live on less than the minimum wage.

So, aged , she started a charity to provide them with meals and toiletries.She didnapost ask who they were, how they voted, orthey were good parents. She just did what was needed to alleviate, a little, the problems of people she did not know. A sick child feeding anguished parents. A rich footballer pointing at child poverty. Both Emmie and Marcus Rashford, her fellow Pride of Britain award winner, are the sort of people who, in a crisis, look at the world and ask themselves how they can improve it for others.  And then we have the sort of people who look at a crisis and ask how they can improve it for themselves. Those who see a vote to feed hungry children as an attack on their right to feel successful. People who see a backlash against that vote as a political problem, rather than a moral one. The sort who, realising they are wrong, want things to look better, rather than be better.Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said the government had misunderstood the mood of the country. Former Childrenaposs Minister Tim Loughton said it was politically a mistake. And Mansfield MP Tory McTwatface said he was taken out of context when he agreed that food vouchers equated with £ a week on crack.It all rather ignores the fact that itaposs about morality, not mood people, not point-scoring and that food vouchers canapost be traded for drugs, for the simple reason that dealers can afford to feed themselves. Letaposs get this clear. Voting against feeding hungry children is a vote FOR making them go hungry. The money local authorities are using to plug the gap is cash that was intended for other hardships. The issue is not one of politics, or popularity, but about whataposs right and whataposs wrong.And to whinge about being taken out of context when even your excuses reek of an over-promoted adolescent with all the wit and personal charm of ear wax just makes it clear, to the world at large and your constituency voters in particular, that weaposd all be better offyou stood down to spend less time in your orices. Wonderingto feed children during school holidays is not about subbing irresponsible parents, or crackheads, or paying for other peopleaposs lestyle choices. Itaposs about why, exactly, anyone has to wonder about it. Itaposs about MPs who just voted themselves a rise to £, giving the equivalent of . minutesapos worth of those earnings to the kids who in the years to come will have to pay for their bad policies.Itaposs about parents furloughed on % pay through no fault of their own having to pay % of the rent, council tax, and fuel bills and suddenly finding thereaposs little left for anything . Itaposs about millions of working families who were already struggling on a minimum wage of £. an hour, or £. for a full dayaposs work, with the prospect of getting just £. a day on the dole. Itaposs about the fact those people in this crisis are more likely to be mums, or pregnant, or young, or nearing retirement.A furloughed minimum-wage mum gets just £. an hour. An MP gets  times that, infor screwing her over. And sheaposd have to wait  years to earn the £, her Prime Minister once described as chicken feed. If that mum got a £ food voucher, sheaposd have £. a day to feed her child. Over a week, that might stretch to a bag of frozen chicken nuggets, a packet of Weetabix,  pints of milk, and some wonky veg. A child would still be malnourished on that, still lose weight, still risk growing up a little wonky themselves, but itaposs better than nothing. It is equivalent to less than half of the £. pan-seared mackerel with heritage tomato ceviche, elderflower gel, horseradish and charred cucumber available as a starter in the MPsapos subsidised dining room. The vote they held was the same as asking themselves whether theyaposd be prepared to allow just one forkful of their mini sirloin of beef, with mini steak and kidney pudding, roasted baby carrots, savoy cabbage and potato terrinefind its way into the mouth of a skinny -year-old. And the debate theyaposre having now is no dferent to asking themselves, before they do so, whether that childaposs parents are virtuous enough to merit their offspring receiving this square mouthful of charity. Those who question whether the poor should get help do so because they fear it will move the poor a little closer to them. Societyaposs isions are beneficial,your sense of self-worth comes from the belief you are doing better than others. Alleviating hunger means there is less space in which to be such an arsehole. Confronted with widespread anger over ordering his MPs to vote against feeding vulnerable children, Boris Johnson is not slapping his head and saying Gadzooks! If only Iaposd known! Heaposs delaying the u-turn until he can find a way to blame Rishi Sunak for it, and Rishi is probably delaying Treasury agreement until he can blame someone . So when that u-turn comes, it wonapost be because the government realised it was wrong. It will be because the likes of Marcus Rashford - and the thousands of people nationwide now offering their own neighbours and customers a packed lunch for youngsters - embarrassed them. They have not, unfortunately, managed to educate them.

Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all warning families to stop children going door-to-door on October , fearing it will spread the virus. Scotlandaposs deputy First Minister even claimed there was a risk bags of sweets between households could pass around Covid-. By contrast, No has failed to provide any clear Halloween-specic rules for England.What do you think  Join the debate in the comments below...Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman this week instead urged aposcommon senseapos. However the government is urging against trick or treating in the areas of England under the strictest lockdowns, one junior minister claimed on Tuesday.Asked by LBCtrick-or-treating was banned this Saturday October , junior business minister Nadhim Zahawi said children in Tier  and  could, but: “Sadly - Tier  - you can’t. It’s a tough thing.However the day before, Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman had said trick-or-treating was not banned. Families were instead urged to use aposcommon senseapos and apply their local tier restrictions to their Halloween plans.But leaders in other parts of the UK have gone much further in asking trick-or-treaters to stay home this year. Hereaposs the guidance for your area... England Can you trick-or-treat in your tier this Halloween  Well, itaposs tricky, Any trick-or-treating will fall under exactly the same rules as other social gatherings in Tier ,  or , Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said. That means some people will be allowed to trick-or-treat and some people will not due to the complex maze of lockdown rules, and how they apply to private property. In all tiers, gatherings of more than six people at any one time will be banned - which includes trick-or-treating pals door-knocking outdoors together. And No appeared to suggest the six-person limit includes both the people knocking on the door, and those answering it. The specic rules for each tier are outlined below.  Tier  In the areas with the strictest lockdowns, it appears homes that open straight onto the street will be legally allowed to help trick-or-treaters - while those with a front garden or block of flats will not. People in Tier will, however, be able to give kids sweetsthe kids stay on the other side of the garden gate, it seems. Halloween parties are also off the menu. If you are living in a Tier  area, you are banned from gathering with anyone who isnapost from your household or bubble, either indoors or in a private outdoor space. That also means any trick-or-treating indoors or in a private garden or block of flats is off-limits. Asked about the rules on trick-or-treating, a No spokesman said: The rules are those which apply to household mixing in general. What that means in practice is thatyou’re in a Very High Covid alert level, than you cannot mix with other households indoors or in private outdoor spaces. No suggested that ban would also apply on the doorstep - because gatherings are banned both inside the house, and in the front garden. Askedthe ban applies to doorsteps, the spokesman replied: I think the question there is around where does someone’s private property begin.  But that response suggests people who live in a house that opens straight onto the street - for example, an old terraced house - are exempt from the ban. It also suggests people are exemptthey host the trick-or-treaters on the other side of their garden gate. The law states that people in Tier  areas are allowed to gather in groups of up to six on a public highway. So as long as people arenapost in a private garden, trick-or-treating could - just about - be allowed. Tier In Tier areas of England, you are banned from gathering indoors with anyone who isnapost from your household or bubble. However, gatherings of up to six people are allowed in private gardens, including the front or back garden.  This means trick-or-treating on someoneaposs porch is acceptable, as long as the group comprises no more than six people in total. A No spokesman said: If you’re in the High Covid alert level, then the rule of six applies in private gardens and outdoor spaces, but households must not mix indoors. Tier In Tier areas of England, you are allowed to gather up to six people from multiple households, either indoors or in a private garden. You should still observe social distancing, but this means trick-or-treating in Tier  areas is allowed. A No spokesman said: In terms of the medium alert level, you can meet inside and outside in no more than six people. ScotlandScotlandaposs Deputy First Minister is urging families there not to send the kids out trick or treating this year. But there doesnapost seem to be a law against it.John Swinney said there was a risk kids dressing up in costumers to go trick or treating, also known as aposguising,apos and touching bags of sweets could spread coronavirus.Speaking to the BBCaposs Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: “We are advising parents not to engage in guising with their children – and that means not going door-to-door. “While I appreciate thataposs disappointing advice, Iaposve got to be realistic with the situation weaposve got. The interaction of humans is how the virus spreads and that can also be spread by the touching of items, like bags of sweeties. He warned the bags of sweets changing hands could be the purveyors of coronavirus. Mr Swinney continued: “That doesnapost mean Halloween canapost happen. There can be all the dressing up that people want to do. There can be Halloween experiences. But what we canapost do is enable children to go round doors, because it would be an opportunity to spread the virus.” WalesPeople in Wales are being “strongly advised” not to go trick or treating for Halloween this year, as the aposfire breakerapos lockdown continues. Again, itaposs not against the law - and sweets donapost appear to be included in Walesapos ban on non-essential shopping. But costumes may be hard to come by with shops closed. And Wales has made it quite clear that the government would rather children did not go trick-or-treating at all, under the current conditions. A Government spokesman in recent weeks said families should not take their children out trick-or-treating this year.“Sadly Halloween, like many other events, will be impacted by coronavirus,” a spokesman for the Welsh Government told Wales Online. “We ask everyone to think how they can keep Wales safe this Halloween and not spread coronavirus. “We strongly advise against traditional trick or treating. The more people you meet in close contact the more chance you have of catching and spreading the virus. “Halloween parties in either your home or at another venue are not allowed as we seek to prevent the spread of the virus. “Please remember not to meet anyone indoors that you don’t live with or is not part of your extended household. This applies to both your home and in places like pubs and restaurants.”  Northern IrelandStormontaposs Health Minister has encouraged children against trick or treating this year - suggesting Halloween revellers stay home instead. Robin Swann suggested children in Northern Ireland go aposbobbing for applesapos in their own homes instead of trick-or-treating around their neighbourhoods. “I would encourage everyone who can stay in the house to stay in the house,” he said in a government briefing in recent weeks.

The surge in the figures appears to have fuelled a sharp dip in school attendance, particularly for teenagers. State-funded secondary school attendance hit just % last week, down from % the week before and % the week before that.  Primary schools fared better with attendance of %, down from % the week before. The Department for Education insisted the two weeks could not be compared directly because some schools were on half-term last week. But the official figures for October  exclude any schools on half-term or with inset days, and still include % of state-funded schools. The government’s experts also suggested Covid-related absence had seen a national rise “unrelated to half term”. Across state schools in England, analysis suggested “Covid-related” absences rose to -% from -% the week before.  The figures come amid a surge in coronavirus cases in England, with more areas discussing entering a Tier  lockdown. “The increase in COVID-related absence accounts for mostof the overall increase in absence between  and  October,” officials added. Overall, % of state schools had one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact in the school - % of secondaries and % of primaries. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This analysis paints a grim picture of the increasingly challenging situation facing schools with attendance falling amidst rising Covid infection rates. In this turbulent context, it is crucial that schools are able to provide disadvantaged pupils with laptops so they can work from homethey have to self-isolate and do not have access to these devices. However, it is very clear that the government has completely underestimated the number of laptops that are needed. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: We need to be confident that the testing system is up to scratch, so that pupils without Covid canto school rapidly and miss as little of their education as possible. Officials said data on inidual pupils is now more comprehensive than before, suggesting better records could account for the higher rate. The government insisted the “vast majority” of the schools affected remain open to most pupils.

Mr Zahawi told Sky News such clubs would not just focus on meals - and claimed they were not the most important thing. The Business Minister said: The best way to deal with this is through both local government and through the welfare system and that’s the right thing to do. We’ve run a pilot costing £m this summer feeding , children. We’ll take learning from that. And it’s not just about the food. I spoke to [businesswoman and charity trustee] Carol Shanahan in Stoke-on-Trent. She tells me that in wards where families want to keep their children safe during those activities, they also appreciate the food - but more important than the food to them was the activities. Tory MPs have faced an outpouring of anger for voting down a bid to extend the £-a-week meal vouchers, provided over summer, to half term and Christmas. But Mr Zahawi said the issues facing children were complex adding: It’s a team effort, this isn’t about pointing fingers. Ms Shanahan, who has looked at child hunger in Stoke for four years, said the Tory minister had represented her views. She told the Mirror: “What I learned very, very quickly is I thought it was all about the food and it isn’t. “The food’s important - it’s not all about the food. “For a lot of kids, it’s that contact with other people and it’s the socialisation.” But she added: “Until we’re working with every school and picking up every child that needs the help, it will never be enough - from any government.” Mr Zahawiaposs comments were based on a pilot of the holiday clubs scheme. Last week he said poor parents actually prefer to pay a modest sum for their kidsapos meals rather than have them for free.  He told the BBC last week: The research when we did the pilot demonstrates that families didnapost just want the meals. Although they valued the meals, they didnapost like the labelling of them being free. They actually prefer to pay a modest amount, £ or £. At the time of his remarks last week, Shadow Early Years Minister Tulip Siddiq said: “The minister’s absurd comments are completely out of touch with families struggling to make ends meet, or concerned about their job. “The Government should wake up to the worries of families across the country and change its decision to withdraw support for children on free school meals.” Mr Zahawi is one of Parliamentaposs richest MPs with millions of pounds of property interests. He earned £, a year in his second job as an oil executive before becoming a minister. The job at Gulf Keystone Petroleum also paid him a £, bonus with no additional hours in . All the interests were declared to Parliament and there is no suggestion he broke any rules.

The Prime Minister faced fury after  Tory MPs voted down a bid to continue free school meal vouchers to Easter . Now he may be budging after pressure from bishops, peers, campaigners, his own party and of course, Marcus Rashford. The Tory leader has hinted he could head off anger by pumping more money into councils, instead of giving vouchers directly. That would allow them to expand a holiday club scheme, which was piloted last year, to the most vulnerable in England. But would this actually stop hungry kids slipping through the cracks  And is it what Marcus Rashford wants  We’ve looked at what the footballer has demanded, what the government might offer - and the gaps between the two.What is the story so far  In junior and secondary school, kids whose parents are on certain benefits and a low income get free school meals.This includes families on Universal Credit, who qualytheir household income is under £, a year.Usually, these meals are only available at school during term time. But under pressure from campaigners including Marcus Rashford, the government expanded them to this years Easter and summer holidays during Covid-.  Campaigners had raised fears children would go hungry because of the economic impact of the pandemic. Because schools weren’t open, parents got vouchers worth £ per child per week to spend in supermarket chains. Aldi, Asda and Tesco were among brands that accepted the vouchers, which could not be spent on cigarettes or alcohol. All state school pupils in Years R,  and  in England get universal free school meals this is separate to the current row. What does Marcus Rashford want   Campaigners have renewed calls for a fresh £ voucher scheme after Marcus Rashford started a petition to the government. However, the footballer’s petition itself is a bit more subtle, and stops short of explicitly demanding a voucher system. He said in August the vouchers were a “sticking plaster” and “we need to switch focus to the bigger picture.” He’s made three demands to be implemented “without delay”.Expand free school meals to all under-s where a parent orclaims Universal Credit or equivalent benefit. Provide meals  activities during all holidays. Increase the value of Healthy Start vouchers to at least £. per week, and expand the scheme.These demands are very similar to those made by the government’s food tsar, Leon founder Henry Dimbleby, in a report on child hunger earlier this year. He called for a scheme named the Holiday Activity and Food Programme to go beyond trials and expand across England. What will the government offer  It’s not clear yet, because the government hasn’t actually made a firm offer. But ministers and the PM have hinted they’ll expand Mr Dimbleby’s idea of a Holiday Activity and Food Programme. Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi said “the best way to do it is through local government” and through Universal Credit. Great, right  Well no, not particularly. On the face of it, this could fulfil one of Marcus Rashford’s three demands - to “provide meals and activities” in the holidays. But we don’t know how much funding councils will get. And that will obviously prompt fears they won’t get enough. After all, ministers have recently been boasting about how they gave £m to councils to fight hunger, yet that money was pledged in June and was due to be spent by this month. And councils have had their funding eroded by Tory austerity.

As a result, Karrine says she has attained mask-wearing exemption from her doctor and has a form to prove it. She claims a bus driver demanded details of her condition - before telling her apositaposs people like you who spread coronavirusapos on her journey from Heywood to Piccadilly on Monday.She told the Manchester Evening News sheaposd never felt so embarrassed in her le.Karrine claims there were other passengers on the bus not wearing masks. She suggested the driver was discriminating against her - prompting him to allegedly demand she get off. When Karrine refused and started filming him, she says the driver abandoned a bus-full of passengers to sit at a bus stop opposite. Diamond Bus North West have said they are investigating the alleged incident. Karrine told the Manchester Evening News : Iaposve never felt so embarrassed in my le. This experience has left me feeling I donapost want to get on a bus again.  I canapost drive because of my medical condition and the bus is the only way I can pick up my daughter. Iaposve never had an experience like this before. Some people may feel comfortable wearing a lanyard about their disability but Iaposm  and I donapost want to be wearing something round my neck. Karrine was travelling from Heywood to Piccadilly after dropping her daughter at her grandparentsapos at around .pm on Monday, when her ordeal unfolded. Karrine, who is currently signed off from her job at an IVF clinic due to her condition, was at the bus stop when the  Diamond bus pulled up.  She said: The driver was gesturing to say whereaposs my mask and wouldnapost open the door. I was asking him to please open the door. Karrine says the driver finally let her on board, and she showed her mask exemption pass as she tapped on. But the driver, she claims, then proceeded to ask her why she was exempt and when she refused to tell him, accused her of apostaking the mickapos. She added: He was saying apositaposs medically proven that masks donapost affect medical conditions and I was telling him I didnapost want to talk to him about this. Karrine says she resorted to taking out her medicine and showing evidence of her condition on her phone - but that when she took a seat he continued to harangue her from the driveraposs cab.  She added: I could tell he was getting angry. He said aposItaposs people like you who spread coronavirusapos. Karrine says there were other passengers on the bus not wearing masks, adding: They were asking me what was going on. One boy was wearing a lanyard and he said the driver hadnapost questioned him when he got on. Karrine, who began to film her experience because she felt discriminated against, added: I asked himit was my race and he askedI was calling him racist.  The driver, Karrine says, then demanded she get off the bus, and when she refused, pulled over, left the cab and went to sit at a bus stop across the road - leaving a bus full of passengers. All passengers, Karrine said, were forced to get off the bus and get the next one. Karrine has complained to Diamond.

Brave Bella Henderson’s chest was scolded by the piping hot water which she knocked off the stove when mum Emily, , was cooking spaghetti bolognese. But Emily turned her back for aposfive secondsapos and the water scolded her daughter. Bella, from Southampton, Hamps, spent seven days in hospital and had an operation to remove the damaged tissue. Emily, who is a print analyst, is sharing her story to raise awareness of burn injuries caused at home. Are you a parent with a warning for other parents  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story She told : “Bella is so sensible I never thought something like this would happen to her. The bolognese was in the microwave and the pasta was on the hob. I told her lunch will be ready soon, as I stepped out of the room for a split second. My back was turned for no more than five seconds and thataposs when I heard horrendous screaming. I was only about two metres away! “She was yanking at her top but couldn’t get any words out and that’s when I saw the pot was on the floor. Bella had stood on her tip toes and knocked the pot of the hob to seethe pasta was ready. “I was panicking but knew I had to act fast. “I immediately ripped her top off her and darted up the stairs to put her in a cold shower. “Bellaaposs screams for help and her shivering from being so cold will forever haunt me forever. “She was uncontrollable and that’s when I noticed how serious it was.” Bella’s skin was ‘falling off’ which prompted Emily to call .  The youngster was given morphine and paracetamol but that didn’t take the pain away. She was blue-lighted to Southhampton General Hospital and then transferred to Salisbury burns unit. Emily added: “Bella was in a cold shower for  minutes at home and a further five minutes at the hospital. “The doctors had to scrub the burn to get the dead layer of skin off whilst Bella had gas and air. “It was horrible to watch her scream in pain. “It was touch and go on whether she would need skin graft.  “Thankfully she didn’t but she was crying for days as she had intense itching and rashes.” Bella was pumped with antibiotics and treated for suspected toxic shock syndrome after the accident in February. After five days, Bella had a debridement operation - a procedure which uses water to remove the dead tissue. Emily said: “They used a high power water jet to blast the burn and find healthy tissue underneath. “I felt like I was in a black tunnel and couldn’t see the light at the end. “I couldn’t believe this had happened to my little girl.  “But she was so brave and didn’t complain about the scar once. “The worst part was every dressing change. They had to be pin her down and even on morphine she was still in pain.” Bella’s father, David, , who is an IT manager, stayed at the hospital whilst Emily looked after their youngest daughter Elsie, then  months. They praised the Children’s Burns Trust for offering support throughout their time in the hospital. Emily said: “We can’t thank the charity enough. “They provide the beds for adults who need to stay in the hospital with their children. “They also use the money to give children little gts to take their mind off what has happened to them.”  Now, eight months on, Bella’s scar still needs moisturising three times per day. The pandemic has put a hold on laser surgery which would make the scar flatter. Emily said: “Bella is the bravest person I know. “It breaks my heart that she will have this scar for le but we have told her not to be ashamed. “She will happily show her friends and family as she has accepted it is apart of her now. “I am gutted that she hasn’t been able to get laser surgery as her scar is now thick and lumpy. “The laser would also remove the redness.” The couple are sharing Bella’s story to warn other parents of accidents that can occur at home.

I thought his eyes looked strange, but I didnapost know his brain had been removed. In the months following his death, June suffered distressing nightmares, which eventually prompted her to seek out his autopsy report. She said: I kept having really bad nightmares about my son, I went to my doctor and said aposIaposve just got a feeling they did something to Ben.apos June said her doctor obtained the report in , and it was from this that she learned Benaposs brain had been in a lab for  months without her knowledge. During her sonaposs letime, she had told medics that she did not consent to his organs being removed - which she says would have been in his medical records. At the time the law said organs could only be taken outthere was “no reason to believe” relatives would object. You canapost desecrate a body like this, thereaposs proper protocols, she said. He was suffering so much alive, I told Benaposs doctors that no one is touching him when he died.  His brain was finally ed in  in a box which was buried alongside Ben in Bury St Edmonds. A priest blessed the box and I thought thataposs the end of it, June said. But she was troubled by a reference in the autopsy report saying that Benaposs spinal cord had been removed. The hospital later said this was a typographical error, and June decided not to pursue it until she was diagnosed with PTSD earlier this year. In order to go forward you have to go back, she said. So I decided I had to find out what had really happened. She contacted Cambridge University Hospital Trust, and discovered a lab report written following Benaposs death had survived - which she demanded to see. What she learned was worse than she expected, as it contained references to the other organs. In a statement tothe trust said a number of slides containing traces from Benaposs lungs, liver and pancreas were ed along with his brain. June said she now wants to very this is the case, as she did not look inside the box. They hadnapost told me about them, I just knew his brain was in there, she said. I will have it exhumed. I need to know the truth. If they ed the slides, the glass will still be in the box and I will know for sure.

Emma Frost, from Blacon, Cheshire, was surprised to hear a knock on the door last week. So it came as quite a shock when her eldest child found two big bags of shopping and five childrenaposs lunch bags sitting on the step, reports CheshireLive. Mother-of-five Emma said a note had been left with the shopping with a kind note from the benefactor, which said a gt from our family to yours Emma said: My eldest went to the door as we were not expecting anyone and found the bags of shopping and five childrenaposs lunch bags. When she came in, she told me that someone had left the shopping with a note. When I read the note I teared up. I was shocked. It was totally unexpected. The heartwarming note read: Hi Emma, Iaposm doing food drops in the community, and someone has put your name forward to receive one. Iaposm also doing kids packed lunches Mon-Fri. If you donapost want to receive the kids lunches, just send me a message. Otherwise Iaposll drop them between : and pm. No need to come to the door, I will knock, drop and leave. A gt from our family to yours. The act of kindness comes after the Government opposed a motion tabled by Labour last week to extend free school meals into half term, leaving many families struggling. Emma said: I think the government have made the wrong decision as there are more families in a worse situation than we are, and they could really do with the help.  This will be amazing support to us this week as we are self-isolating due to my partners brother having a positive case of coronavirus. The unexpected surprise prompted mixed reactions from her children, aged between -months and -years-old.She said: My -year-old was shocked and my five-year-old and four-year-old were both very excited. My -month old just wanted the biscuits he had spotted at the top of the bag.

As it stands, both the Queen and the Cambridges are living in Tier  areas so canapost mix indoors with other households. Palace staff are working on the assumption that the Queen will travel to Sandringham, where Philip is currently living, and the couple will stay in the main house.

Jack Lear took a gamble when the country went into lockdown and created a new business selling discounted consumer goods. The -year-old already owned a fancy dress website and had just ordered , costumes ready for Halloween when his market began to shrink by the day, He told Wales Online : “I had already committed to the , costumes and signed contracts. I realised Iaposd dug myself into a pretty big hole with no market to sell them. I could try and weather the storm, which is what most people have done, or I could gamble and start a new business. After reading a report on how Amazon had taken on nearly , workers during the pandemic, Jack realised he could make some serious money.  He decided to invest £, to launch BargainFox, and his first product to take off was beard trimmers – mainly because barbers and hairdressers had to shut up shop during lockdown. He has now expanded the range to more than , dferent products across everything from household goods to baby products to sport and leisure gear. Jack sums up his typical customer type as a bargain hunter. They don’t mind a damaged box – they are interested in what is inside and that they are getting it at a heavily discounted price, he says.

BargainFox draws on much of the experience he has gained from running Bodysocks but its reach is much more ambitious – while the fancy dress goods market worldwide is worth billions consumer and household goods is worth trillions. “We are taking inspiration from Amazon, one of the best warehousing companies in the world.” BargainFox has contracts with retailers to take customer s and liquidation stock – items that are new or as new but sometimes with damaged packaging. On average the thousands of items are discounted by  per cent from the recommended retail price. Jack has always been interested in running his own business and started out buying and selling on eBay when he was just a schoolboy. As soon as he started making enough money he quit his A-levels, though his decision didn’t go down well with his mum. By his s Jack was drawing up designs for fancy dress costumes on Clip Art and sending them to be made a factory in China. Reflecting on his earlier business, Jack said: I didnapost have the ability to invent a new product but I hit on fancy dress because the costumes are quite basic, the design element is quite straightforward and simplistic. But now the process has become a little more sophisticated and some of hes designs have even been ed around the world. Halloween costumes account for nearly half of his entire yearly sales and  per cent of his business goes to America. While the UK market has stalled sales in the US are on course to match last year, which he says he will take as a small victory given the circumstances. In July  he bought the contents of a Manchester based warehouse fro a failed party goods company and suddenly found out he owned more than , products. He said: “There were , products in that warehouse with , dferent product codes. We had to update our software to manage that level of stock,’’ he says. “That gave us the skill to process tens of thousands of products and to be able to locate each of those inidually in a warehouse.’’ BargainFox is now running smoothly and each item is inidually checked, photographed and uploaded to the website by a team. There are also pickers who collect the items from the floor-to-ceiling shelving with two electric order pickers that have sufficient elevation to reach the top shelf, packers to prepare orders, and a restocking team.

Michael Gray Sr, , and Shirley Gray, , are accused of keeping a teen boy locked in a basement for four years, and feeding him only scraps of bread and water. The Roane County couple were charged after the body of an -year-old girl allegedly kept in their basement as punishment was found buried at their East Tennessee property over the summer. The Grays appeared in court this week to deny all charges against them in a -count indictment relating to the death of one of their adopted children, and the abuse and neglect of two of the three others, Knox News reports.  They are being investigated over the treatment of children aged  to  from  to May this year. According to Knoxville news station WVLT , investigators were alerted to the childrenaposs plight when police received a call from a member of the public who found a boy wandering along the road alone. He told officers he didn’t know where his parents were or where he was. Police took the child home and contacted local childrenaposs services after the Grays said they were not aware he had left the house. The teen allegedly then told investigators there was another boy, aged around  years old, in the coupleaposs basement, and a dead child buried in the backyard. The Sun reports that court documents show the Grays are accused of keeping two of their children in a wire dog cage. All of the children were said to have been home-schooled and appeared “stunted in growth” when authorities discovered them, according to the coupleaposs arrest warrants. Investigators said Michael Gray admitted that his -year-old daughter had died in  and was buried inside a barn in the yard, according to court documents. Officials alleged she had been kept in the basement as punishment for stealing food and within months, had died. The surviving -year-old boy had also been locked in the basement since June , according to the arrest warrant. It alleged he “had no contact with anyone outside the basement, only given small amounts of food, being white bread and some water.” Shortly after the girl’s body was discovered, the remains of a boy was discovered at another property linked to the couple in Knox County, Tennessee. Reports say at the time of the discovery the second home belonged to the Graysapos son, Michael Anthony Jr, whom investigators allege knew about the abuse the children faced.   The boyaposs death is still being investigated and the Graysapos indictment is not related to that case. The couple did not report either of the childrenaposs deaths and are accused of continuing to receive financial benefits for both of the children who were found dead. In May, Department of Childrenaposs Services commissioner Jenner Nichols released a statement about the case. Words are inadequate. Cruelty such as this makes us question all that we know to be true, she said. I am so grateful to the passersby who saw a child in a situation that just didn’t seem right and stopped to help. That one small action led to the discovery of children who were victims of severe abuse and neglect. Those children are now in a safe place and being cared for and their parents face signicant criminal charges. I am also thankful for our DCS child protective services staff who worked together as a team, followed their instincts to dig a little further when first notied of the situation and immediately alerted law enforcement.

The solitary bottleneck dolphin appeared in Dingle Bay, off the coast of County Kerry in  and since then has become one of the areas most beloved residents. Fungie, a male dolphin, loves to seek out human company and enjoys playing with swimmers, surfers, ers and kayakers when they take to the sea. Since he first appeared  years ago, Fungie has been draw for tourists from across Ireland and abroad with dolphin spotting boat trips regularly taking people out to meet the playful dolphin. But then, several weeks ago, when Fungie, who was an adult when he arrived in Dingle Bay, wasnapost seen for a few days and the locals began to worry. Their concerns have now turned to heartbreak as no sign of the friendly dolphin has been seen since. In the days following Fungieaposs initial disappearance a huge search was launched using sonar scanning and scuba ers. But as hope began to fade that the dolphin would , this has now been stood down. Jimmy Flannery, the founder and owner of Dingle Sea Seafari tours, says searchers are “drained – mentally and physically.  He told the Irish Mirror : People have to realise and respect this is a friend thataposs gone missing. It’s not an object.”Jimmyaposs bond with the dolphin is so strong that when his we, who was born in Donegal, moved to Dingle the first thing he did was take her to meet Fungie. He said: He’s pulled me through thick and thin. Iaposve spent times with him when I needed just some company, and not human company. Iaposve spent it with him. I was only  years old when Fungie arrived, and Iaposm taking people out since I was  years old.  Heaposs an institution. He was the mascot, he was the sentinel at the entrance to the harbour that would meet and greet every boat no matter what. Nuala Moore, an extreme swimmer who would often meet Fungie on her regular sea swims, added: Weaposre all feeling really sad. Weaposve been sharing this body of water for  years. I grew up swimming with him. But whataposs happened to the beloved dolphin  Fungie was an adult dolphin when he first appeared in the bay and is though to be in his early to mid-s. In the wild, dolphins has a le expectancy of around  and Dr Kevin Flannery, a marine biologist in the local area, says time could simply have run out for Fungie. He explained: I would say that at this stage, because he hasnapost ed, weaposre looking at the age profile. Basically what happens to old dolphins at that stage is that theyaposre unable to catch their own food and with his age profile, he has possibly died of starvation. However, old age is not the only possible cause for Fungieaposs mysterious disappearance - the could be happier outcomes. Fungie could have left the bay because of large numbers of other dolphins in the local area. He could also have been chasing sprat, which are dolphins favourite food, further out to sea. And in the happiest outcome - Fungie, who has been alone ever since he arrived off the coast of Dingle, could have eloped with a partner.  Tragically, itaposs also possible the loveable dolphin has died of starvation. Dr Flannery said: A wild animal that has to catch his own fish for  or  years, he would be slowing down, like we all do coming up to that age. “And trying to catch fish wonapost be as easy, so the possibility of starvation comes into play – that he could have died of hunger or something like that. And while locals are heartbroken at the loss of their friend from the sea, Fungieaposs disappearance will also have a devastating impact on the townaposs economy.

After the baby was born in Krasnoyarsk, the midwe is said to have handed the child to the woman’s husband, believing the man to be Chechenaaposs spouse. “When I gave birth to a son, my maternal instincts appeared,” said Chechena. “Before we were discharged from the hospital, I breastfed him myself.” Despite having second thoughts, she said she agreed to go ahead and sell the baby. “They immediately took the child away in a taxi,” she said. “Later I called them several times, and they did not answer. “Then they blacklisted me.” Later she pocketed the agreed £which was transferred to her card, she said. “In the summer they transferred me the money to my bank card, like a lump sum,” she said. “I used it to buy sweets and clothes for the children.“If they had ed me the child, my fourth son, I would have taken him.” The buyers have been found and are now in detention. The baby boy is in the care of social services. Chechena is under home arrest so she can care for her three older sons.

The club has done a lot for me and I want to repay the club in the best way I can – that’s by playing well and getting clean sheets.“Everyone wants to play every week, that’s why we’re footballers. It’s what I love to do. I love to train but you don’t get that buzz from getting a win.“I hope I can stay in now, grow and progress and, hopefully, get more clean sheets.”The day started on a very positive note for Dundee with the five changes made by boss James McPake making an instant impact.As well as Ferrie, coming into the team were Danny Mullen, Jonathan Afolabi, Shaun Byrne and Declan McDaid with Hamilton, Paul McGowan and Fin Robertson dropping to the bench.McDaid played his part early on, sending in a cross which found its way to Jordan Marshall with the left-back picking out Afolabi eight yards out to smash home his first goal for the club since signing from Celtic on loan.Afolabi would go close again while centre-back Lee Ashcroft had a fierce volley blocked in front of goal as the Dark Blues went searching for a second goal.David Hopkin’s Morton, though, grew into the game with their pressing continually forcing the home side back towards their own goal.I felt like as a team we dealt with the pressure well, limited their chances to just a couple of shots which were relatively easy saves at the end of the day.Dundee were still a threat but Ton had the better opportunities in the second half with a Markus Fjortoft header going just wide and an Aidan Nesbitt effort in stoppage time stopped by Ferrie.The young goalie, though, stood up to everything thrown his way by the Greenock side as he earned his first-ever shutout in Dundee colours.“It was a good way personally to start the season but a clean sheet isn’t just me, it’s the defence, midfield and strikers all working as a unit,” he said.“We saw that against Morton and had to deal with a lot of pressure, even when they went down to  men.“I felt like as a team we dealt with the pressure well, limited their chances to just a couple of shots which were relatively easy saves at the end of the day.“That’s what you want, a clean sheet, three points and let’s kick on now.”Ferrie may have taken Hamilton’s spot in the team but the Englishman revealed he’s had nothing but support from his fellow keeper after finding out he was in the team.“I found out on Friday and, personally, I’m very happy to be involved,” Ferrie said.“I’ve worked hard for it so, hopefully, I can kick on now.“Me, Jack, the young goalie Harry , and Bobby Geddes all work together as a unit and in training push each other to get better. That’s what you need.“Everyone knows about the goalkeeper’s union and we do look out for one another, want each other to do well.“We push each other in training every day.”He added: “The result against Hearts was dficult but as a team we just need to move on from it.“There are still another  games to go so it’s a long season and, at the end of the day, a - is only worth three points, same as a - is worth three points.“Now we just have to build momentum and that winning mentality throughout the squad.“You can build on clean sheets and then you only need one goal to win the game.“I think it’s about getting momentum and building on that result, taking that winning feeling into next week’s game.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretkQdjLrfQ\" data-secret\"kQdjLrfQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We limited them to the minimum of chances which was pleasing.“There was one set play we were poor at and they had a couple of half chances.“But that’s as comfortable a defensive performance as a team as we have had at Dens, certainly in my time here and especially after conceding six the previous week.“So he was maybe just a bit annoyed after the game. Emotions are high and sometimes you don’t say what you are really thinking or feeling as he certainly couldn’t have been feeling that.”He added: “They certainly aren’t fitter.“Look, he is hurting that they have lost the game. They were on an unbeaten run.“There is a pride there as well. They want to win every game.“He is a good manager and has got out of this league with a dferent club before but I don’t think his comments were really true. Anyone who saw the game knows that.“I don#t need to fire back. We got the three points from a confident, dominant performance.“It was really pleasing after what happened before.”Looking back, that’s the pleasing thing # after such a poor performance and a heavy defeat the previous week, we did hold out.After conceding six the previous week, Dundee showed resilience to stand up to Morton and keep the clean sheet, something that delighted the Dens gaffer.“Looking back, that’s the pleasing thing # after such a poor performance and a heavy defeat the previous week, we did hold out,” McPake added.“I thought we looked solid enough and were comfortable in the game. I was really pleased with that.“The start of last season, I don’t knowthat’s a game we would have won, particularly after a bad defeat.“We weren’t very resilient and we couldn’t get the levels up quickly enough.“On Saturday, we started the game very well which was pleasing.“We dictated most of the game but when they went down to  men was probably when they had the most chances.“They threw caution to the wind. A goal down with five minutes to go, they were throwing everything at it. Shape goes out the window looking for that goal.“But we held out well.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretFthLPvtaeh\" data-secret\"FthLPvtaeh\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

proud of his city and region, our history and being at the heart of our community.“Ironically he loved cars but could not drive and took three buses a day to and from Cormack Park.“He was the kindest of men.”Among the online tributes were those from captain Joe Lewis and defender Shay Logan, who described Mr Cheyne as “an absolute legend”.In a statement, the club said it was “deeply saddened” by Mr Cheyne’s death.“‘Andy at the Gate’ was renowned for offering guests at Balgownie and latterly Cormack Park a heartfelt and friendly welcome,” it said.“He was also a well-known face at Pittodrie on matchdays too, greeting the management team, players, directors, staff, the media, guests and supporters on their arrival.“Andy had an infectious personality and was an outstanding ambassador for Aberdeen FC.“He was a man who always left anyone he met with a positive feeling for the football club, however long or short the encounter.“The ultimate gentleman, he will be sorely missed by all at the club, as well as many football families across the country.”Head of academy coaching Gavin Levey said: “This news has come as a real shock to us all.“For a number of years, Andy has been our front line and face of the youth academy.“Andy received our ‘Unsung Hero’ award at the academy presentation night.“As anyone who knew him knows, he had a wonderful friendly personality which ensured all members of the academy and our visitors were given such a warm welcome.“In the past few months, Andy had started a new role working with people who have autism.“He was such a caring person who always wanted to help others.“Aberdeen Football Club and the academy ‘family’ meant so much to him.“He was an absolute gentleman and a man who will be remembered very fondly by so many people.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Some are sharing with parents or siblings, or in some cases, simply sleeping on the floor.Sainsbury’s Furniture Store will be providing the furniture at cost price and supplying a free delivery and set-up service for each one purchased.This week marks the final days of the appeal, and AberNecessities is urging people to give generously to help the organisation meet its £, target.So far, the charity has raised £, for youngsters in need and their families.Danielle Flecher-Horn, co-founder of AberNecessities, said: #We have seen the most phenomenal response and generous support for our Sweet Dreams campaign, for which we’re incredibly grateful.#We set ourselves an ambitious goal of £, and I cannot put into words how happy we are to have nearly reached this target.#This simply could not have happened without the selflessness and kindness of those who donated.#Thanks to the people in this city we’ll be able to provide not only a new bed but a happy memory for a little person who has been experiencing hardship.##As a result of the appeal, we#ll be able to provide more than  beds complete with our #Snug as a Bug# bundle which includes new pyjamas, slippers, a dressing gown, a bedtime story, hot water bottle and teddy bear.#For every £ over the target that is another bed bought for another child#s night of sweet dreams.#In May, AberNecessities was awarded £, from the Lord Provost’s Charitable Trust Aberdeen Covid- Hardship Fund.The money enabled the charity to provide more local families with essentials to care for their babies and children throughout the pandemic.Locals, businesses and supporters can donate directly to the AberNecessities #No Child Should Go Without Sweet Dreams’ appeal through the JustGiving page at https:bit.ly hyovjGFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Volunteer helpers including Patrick Gibb from Strachur, Martyn and Robin Webster, Terry Muirhead-Smith and Derek Anstee of Inveraray.Early October is expected to see a big event – the -foot hull finally turned right way up, marking the half-way point in its construction.The wooden sections came largely pre-cut and shaped by Jordan Boats of Somerset, ready to be assembled locally around a #hog# template using woodworking tools and an epoxy binder. With the main build phase over, she next requires seats and gunwales, not to mention a paint job and a set of oars.When complete the skf will likely be launched at Strachur. It is to be crewed by a team of four rowers and a coxswain.The boat will be named #Mrs McPhun# after the Strachur woman who thought she was widowed by the hanging of her husband Archie McPhun for murder at Inveraray. As Mrs McPhun, their child and the body were being rowed back to Strachur for burial, Archie’s ‘corpse’ groaned, and he was resuscitated. He lived on for some years, albeit with a crooked neck!In recognition of the expected funeral that happily never happened, the skf will be painted black.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club was set up in Inveraray two years ago with the aim of building and operating a St Ayles skf on the upper reaches of the loch.The club is a member of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building, rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish Coastline. Most follow the design of the St Ayles skf, which emerged in Anstruther based on the traditional Fair Isle skf, and the Scottish community rowing regattas that were traditionally popular.The kit-built boat greatly reduces the cost to a community and, as they are a standard design, they can be fairly raced in rowing against one another. It quickly became a remarkable success, attracting worldwide attention and creating its own boating class association, St Ayles Skf International . There are now over  St Ayles skfs operating around Scotland’s coast and abroad, including over a dozen in Argyll and others in the Netherlands, USA and Australia.The SCRA now has over  member clubs around the Scottish Coast and on large freshwater lochs.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club, which aims to promote community spirit, learning and purposeful activity for young and old, is open to new members – to help maintain the boat, and potential rowers and navigators keen to learn nautical skills.For further information about the rowing club please contact Martyn Webster at martyn@martynwebster .For club membership or purchasing a share in the boat please contact Terry Muirhead-Smith at terrymuirheadsmith@hotmail .PICS:. no-a_LochFyneSkfNeil Wilson at work on the keel, watched by Robin Webster. no-a_LochFyneSkf. no-a_LochFyneSkf"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor october 2 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSirThe fiasco that is the A   Rest and be Thankful is an apt metaphor for the ineptitude of the Scottish government and its handling of issues as erse as transport, the economy, education and health matters.R Finlay, ArdrishaigSir,With regard to your interesting article on routes into Argyll proposed by transport Scotland I see no mention of a tunnel. Surely the simplest solution would be a tunnel from Arrochar to Butterbridge, or from Ardgarten to Butterbridge. From Arrochar may be better as the route is more of a straight line.As a former resident of Tarbert now living in Taynuilt I now live less than  miles from a tunnel into and below a hillside at Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan. I refer of course to the tunnel constructed in  with less sophisticated tools than available now.I have also seen an article on the building of tunnels for carrying water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, much earlier than , again using more primitive equipment. In addition to those tunnels look at the construction of the railways during the railway early years. There are examples of tunnelling all over the world where knowledge could be given to the Scottish government.Cost should not be an issue, as it seems none is being spared at present to no avail.Dugald McDougall, TaynuiltSir,Many years ago I suggested, to an MP, option seven in the list of options being considered in the list released by the Scottish Government.I also pointed out that the bridging of the Loch Fyne narrows at Port Ann could be used to generate hydro power by incorporating hydro tunnels at the base of the crossing and thus provide income to alleviate costs, while the same time reducing travels costs for commercial and private users and consequently help the environment by reducing pollution.I received favourable opinion from a prominent firm of civil engineers and a #like# from a government official. To give that person credit, however, there were very many more pressing problems.I also note that the simplest idea I have since offered – that of a tunnel through the saddle to connect the ends of the existing military roads below and on each side of the Rest and thereafter, upgrading the old military road to A road standard is not even considered.This begs the question why is  Government in such a mountainous region of Scotland so averse to tunnels In the time since I made such suggestions, more than enough money has been drained away in making repairs.Capt Jim Currie, former Tarbert harbour masterScotland has around , older military veterans and Age Scotland believes that many go without the assistance available to them, such as priority healthcare for conditions linked to their service, help with dental and eye care, housing and financial support.We have launched a revamped version of our popular free #Veterans# Guide to Later Le in Scotland#.The guide features information about support and opportunities available to every older person in Scotland, plus content specically for British Armed Forces veterans including regulars, reservists, National Servicemen and merchant navy who have sailed in support of a British military operation.It is most relevant to veterans aged  plus, but much of the content will be of interest to veterans aged -, regardless of how long ago, or for how long they served.If you are aged  or older, live in Scotland and have served in the armed forces, the guide will be most relevant to you. It doesn’t matter how long ago, or for how long, you served: you may have had a military career, a short period of national service, been a reservist, or even supported a military operation with the merchant navy.Many people we’ve met through our Veterans’ Project left the armed forces with little or no support for readjusting to civilian le. Today, the military is more proactive in supporting that transition, but older veterans it seems were, by and large, left to it.Our guide aims to ensure veterans have a better experience when making the transition to later le.Veterans and their families can request a free paper guide by calling Age Scotland on     or visiting www.age.scot veteransguide.

closed, and contact sports for people aged  and over will also remain suspended with an exception of professional sports.Gyms and pools can remain open for inidual exercise, but indoor group activities are not allowed for people over .What is the new system It is understood the new system, which is due to start on November , would have three central tiers akin to the medium, high and very high alert levels in England, which curb hospitality and social mixing.However, there would also be an extra upper and lower level.The lowest would be as close to normality as possible in the absence of a vaccine, while the topmost tier would involve extreme restrictions, including travelbans.Closing schools and switching to home-based \"blended learning\" would always be a last resort.But there is not yet clarity on exactly what the public could expect in each tier.Under current proposals it is not thought any area will be placed onto the top tier straight away, but central belt areas already facing tighter restrictions are likely to be put into the second-top category when the system is brought in on November .Watch FM @NicolaSturgeonexplain why itrsquos important to book a test

That ambition must be tempered with a degree of realism – Argyll and Bute needs a solution to be delivered as soon as possible and the delivery timeline is a key issue in considering all the options.#That is why the council supports option one as offering realistic solutions which will increase resilience on the A and provide the uninterrupted year-round access that Argyll and Bute needs and deserves.#This route corridor appears, on the face of it, to offer the most deliverable set of solutions within an option, although these remain engineering projects of considerable signicance and which will be complex to progress.#Six of the other  options will not be supported by the council, while options two to five are not ruled outthey can be delivered sustainably.Of those, the council rates option five as its preference. The route would make use of existing roads while new crossings would be built over Loch Long between Whistlefield and Barnacabber, and Loch Fyne between Otter Ferry and Port Ann.Option two goes through Glen Kinglas, option three through Glen Fyne, and option four starts the same as option five from Arden, but moves north from Barnacabber to Cairndow.On those four options, the council said: #These ambitious proposals have signicant transformative potential for Argyll and Bute, increasing resilience as well as enhancing connectivity to, from and for all of Argyll and Bute, including opening up more direct connections to the central belt for communities like Mid Argyll and Kintyre.#If any of these options can be delivered or substantially progressed within an acceptable timeframe, then the council will support them.##The opportunities arising from more direct access to and from the central belt could be truly transformational. The scale and ambition of these corridor options would suggest that they are longer term options.#Councillor Rory Colville said: #Whilst some of the options put forward are to be welcomed, option one is the only one that can be delivered in a realistic timescale.

The front runner appears to be option one and,this proves to be feasible and affordable, we will need to maintain pressure on the Scottish Government to make sure it delivers as promised.

There will be talks about the impact of beavers on local wildle tourism, the future of Knapdale Forest and an update on the national approach to beavers.The project began in , aiming to bolster the population of beavers released during the Scottish Beaver Trial.Twenty-one beavers were introduced from Tayside to increase numbers and genetic ersity in the Knapdale beaver population. All animals were screened by qualied vets prior to release to ensure they were healthy and disease-free.Annual surveys show many animals released through the project have successfully established territories and bred.

The financial help we are making available will enable outlets to make this signicant positive step.#There is an understanding among communities about the damage done by single-use packaging as they see the effects in the countryside, beaches and seas around them.#As well as reducing waste, by opting for reuse we also reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating the need to extract, transport and manufacture materials to make new products.#The scheme is part of a larger £ million programme designed to inspire locally-led green projects as part of the recovery from the Covid- pandemic.Across Scotland, around kg of packaging per household generates an estimated , tonnes of global production emissions per year. Single-use grocery packaging also creates litter.Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: #The Islands Green Recovery Programme will stimulate new economic activity across our islands – helping to create a sustainable green economy.#We are aware that mitigating the effects of climate change can be more expensive for those living on our islands, which is why we are delighted to announce this funding.#This investment with Zero Waste Scotland is available to small and medium enterprises – who wish to offer customers a packaging-free shopping experience, where they are encouraged to use their own re-useable containers to purchase a range of foods and household groceries.#Applications for funding are open until pm on November  .

The original £, awarded for improvements related to town centres was topped up by a further £, funding. There was also an additional £, to improve walking and wheeling access to schools.After fully analysing responses from the consultation, local area committees have agreed to go ahead with a number of projects across the authority area.According to the council, the consultation identied that Campbeltown#s town centre already has sufficient space for physical distancing and maintaining all existing car parking spaces was seen as a priority.Instead, work will focus on providing a cycleway and improved pavements on the section of Ralston Road between Campbeltown Hospital and Campbeltown Grammar School which is bounded by playing fields and therefore will not require any space to be taken from the existing road.The council is also looking at the Esplanade to confirma segregated cycleway can be accommodated without losing any existing on-street parking.Councillor Colville said: #I believe the analysis and participation in the consultation was excellent, the results from which, when linked to the new Traffic Regulation Order now in operation, will greatly improve access to town centre shopping.#I would also thank officers in gaining funding to improve social distancing on the narrow pavements leading to the Grammar school, something both myself and Councillor Armour were keen to achieve.#Councillor Armour added: #The result of the consultation is exactly what I was hearing from local businesses and the public, that there was enough space in the middle of the town to social distance.#I think the idea of a cycleway and improved pavements between the hospital entrance and the school bus turning area is an excellent idea and something Councillor Colville and myself pushed hard for during the consultation.#The pavement in that area is far too narrow when pupils are coming and going from school so opening up the area and including a safe cycleway should allow a safe distance for those walking on the pavement and a new option with the cycleway.#However, Councillor Kelly said: #Every grant and tranche of funding must be used to gain maximum benefit for the community. I would rather see this funding utilised in the town centre and surrounding area to make much-needed improvements to the pavements including installing drop kerbs to improve disabled access. This would be a much better use of what is a limited resource.#"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 23 2020","story":"Their expressions are so remarkable and certainly give a flavour of what is being said.I would dearly love to learn this and I#m delighted to see children are learning to do signing in our schools.Non-verbal communication is a powerful means of conveying feelings in all members of the animal kingdom.We just need to watch animals from the great majestic elephants to the tiniest ant.Elephants have such sensitivity that they even have their own grieving ritual.When one of their own dies, the herd gather round the dead animal in a circle, gently touching the deceased with their trunks then, just as gently, cover the elephant with leaves, before standing silently and completely still for hours with great respect.As I watch our two collies, I see the amazing communication between them.

Its constables included several Lauders of the Bass. Their writ ran south of the Tweed to include Ancroft, Kyloe, Norham, Belford, Elwick and Tweedmouth, as well as present-day Berwickshire.At a time when the sea was the highway for commerce in heavy goods, South Berwickbecame the richest city in the land, thriving on trade with the Low Counties and Hanseatic Ports in timber, wool and produce from the Merse.English kings coveted its strategic location. While the English were embroiled where, Berwick blossomed. At other times, Berwick changed hands  times until, in , it fell to Richard III. Elizabeth I secured it with massive fortications, which survive intact.With the Union, most of its hinterland stayed in Scotland. For five centuries, this made scant dference beyond legal issues. However, re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament created disparities ndash in free personal care, prescriptions, tuition fees, etc.Resentment at this in Berwick itself was compounded when Berwick District Council was abolished and the town became a remote appendage to Northumberland.The northward bulge of the border between the Cheviots and the sea remains a defensive throwback. This modern anomaly of Berwick and the disparity between its residents and those in its hinterland could be resolved by a plebiscite among the , residents to decidethe border should be shted south from Lamberton Toll to around Lindisfarne, ing the town and southern villages to Berwickshire.Satisfactory as this might be to locals, Westminster is likely to block such a move.

The important role of plants in reducing pollution is now so widely recognised that many nations are actively promoting large-scale planting of trees.Whilst most of us would be upset to think that there might be poor air quality in our homes, the reality is that common airborne pollutants such as CO, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and phthalates from new materials and furnishings are quite normal, and that is exacerbated where the building, furnishings and decoration are new.Working from home offers an opportunity to optimise the air quality in which we work and live, ensuring best conditions. Although therersquos no substitute for opening the window and circulating the air, we live in Scotland and sometimes thatrsquos simply not possible! Cue houseplants to help improve the air quality, reduce noise pollution and generally create a more relaxed, natural environment.Our top  indoor plants:. Chlorophytum Possibly our best-selling indoor plant, this green and white iegated plant is very simple to care for.With research showing that the spider plant is capable of removing up to  per cent of household air-borne toxins in just two days, itrsquos easy to see why itrsquos a customer favourite.The graceful arching habit of the spider plant makes it suitable as either a hanging plant or in a pot on the desk.One interesting feature of the spider plant is that it produces little lsquoplantletsrsquo on stems which can be easily rooted to create a new plant.. Spathiphyllum The peace lily is also a very easy plant to care for, and very attractive with glossy green leaves and pure white flowers. It is an excellent air purier and is particularly good at removing mould spores and household vapours such as benzene, ammonia and acetone.Depending on the iety, the peace lily can range in height from around cm to over one metre.The peace lily is happy in medium to low light levels, making it ideal for the home office. Attractive purely as a foliage plant, yoursquoll encourage more flowering with better light.The peace lily is unlikely to need watering every day and itrsquos best to take your cue from the plant itself. If the leaves begin to droop, itrsquos usually a sign that it needs some water, but be careful and check that itrsquos not because you have over-watered ndash being too generous with water is one of the most common reasons for these plants to fail!. Ficus benjamina Many plants ndash both indoors and outdoors ndash can be useful in reducing noise pollution. So,your home office is in the corner of a room thatrsquos used by other family members, plants with lots of foliage can be a useful way to create an aesthetic room ider and separate noise.There are many weeping fig ieties available, offering a choice of dferent shades of green or iegated silver green or gold green foliage.Weeping figs thrive in areas where there is good light andlight is only available from one direction, growth will be primarily on the light-facing side. Thatrsquos finethe plant is only seen from one side, for exampleitrsquos against a wall, but for all-round foliage, yoursquoll need to rotate the plant occasionally.As with most houseplants, water when the compost is dry to the touch and take care not to over-water.. Monstera One of the most easily recognised indoor plants with an upright habit and large glossy leaves with cuts and holes , itrsquos native to the South American rainforests and it is understood that the leaves have naturally developed these holes and cuts to help the plantrsquos large leaves avoid damage in tropical storms.In the home, it is often grown on a moss pole to provide an anchor for the aerial rootswhich fix into the pole for stability as the plant grows taller.This plant doesnrsquot need a great deal of attention water when the compost becomes dry, and place it in a bright room but preferably not in direct sunlight, and mist the leavesthe humidity seems low..

Swimming in the freezing water at Dunbar open-air pool in the rsquos and rsquos the Salty Selkies and the Bass Rock Swimmers of North Berwick, who got me to ditch my wetsuit the RNLI who rescued me and saved my le a few years ago my friend Linda Malcolm, whorsquos swum with me in all weathers and temperatures and finally Alistair Forbes and his dog Bentley.ldquoAlistair watched me swim for years early in the mornings when out walking Bentley. He looked out for me going in and coming back. Seeing him on the green at the anchor whilst I was out swimming was always a reassuring sight.ldquoHe supported my dream... although thought I was mad!ldquoSadly, both he and Bentley passed away this year before the swim was completed, but along with everyone who helped me get there and my long-suffering partner David, they were all with me whilst I was swimming.

Not Calum Franklin.\"My we works for the NHS so I think I had just a mixture of guilt and boredom after a week - I needed to do something,\" Franklin tells me on the phone, just days before hes due to reopen the highly-acclaimed restaurant and The Pie Room - which sells pastry-based creations to-go - both located at the five-star Rosewood Hotel.\"Theres a local butcher near me in Greenwich and I get on well with the owner - I went in with a plan. What we did was we organised a local business group in the Greenwich area,\" he explains.\"Whether it was a cheesemonger, a baker, a brewery, they all provided ingredients free of charge, then we made pies here in the hotel and sold them at the butchers.\"And then all the money we raised over the lockdown period went towards building a garden for staff at Greenwich and Lewisham NHS hospitals, and we also raised money for a local hospice that really suffered during that period because of fundraising.\"Before embarking on the pie-making project, Franklin had started, like many chefs, preparing meals for hospital workers.\"I got word from a few hospitals that they were actually inundated with food, so I thought, I want to do something more permanent,\" he adds. \"At the end of this, its like a reminder, this is a thanks [to the staff] for your hard work.\"As well as his philanthropic efforts, with many eateries closed, the British chef was making more meals at home than usual this year too. So has he suffered, as many people have reported, any cooking fatigue \"For me it was washing-up fatigue. Ive never done so much washing-up in my le,\" Franklin says with a chuckle, though he admits there was one benefit to not being able to eat out as much as usual.\"What it made me realise is, actually, that my diet was pretty poor before, because Id go out a lot and eat in London a lot of the time. Looking at it now, my we and I are maybe eating meat once a week, or fish twice a week, the rest of the time its vegetarian food.\"The -year-old has also been busy preparing for the launch of his debut cookbook. Called The Pie Room, it features dishes that have appeared on the Holborn Dining Room menu alongside some new recipes, as well as detailed guides on how to perfect all the classic pastry types, from shortcrust to choux.Franklin hopes itll help dispel some of the fear that surrounds pastry-making. Why does he think people are often scared when it comes to the baking staple \"One of the biggest issues people have, I think, is not controlling temperatures. Its that thing of when you try to make a pie on a summers day and its super hot in the kitchen and the pastrys melting, the butters splitting out of it, its hard to make it look pretty...\"That in itself is enough to put someone off doing pastry again, I think - that or getting a Wellington wrong and youve got the whole family sat around the table and you cut it and it doesnt look nice, the beefs overcooked... Its a lot of work for it to go wrong.\"Naturally, the self-confessed pastry deviant thinks homemade is best, but even he will bust out a packet of the shop-bought stuff on occasion.\"Theres no shame in it. Ill use Jus-Rol at homeIm in a rush to do something, I have that in the freezer,\" he says, which is why recipes in the book include the option of readymade in the ingredients list.\"One thing that always plays on my mind throughout the whole process is that everyones lives are so busy nowadays. I think you will get a better result by doing your own handmade pastryyou follow those recipes in the book, but its not going to be for every night.\"So whats a good a recipe for a beginner to start with  Its not, you may be surprised to discover, a time-honoured British classic, but a thoroughly modern pie with a American-inspired filling.\"Something like the mac and cheese pie is a good one because the fillings really quick and easy, and then you can apply some of the decoration techniques that are in the book,\" Franklin says. \"And its SO tasty. Its super naughty - Ive never served that and it hasnt made people smile.\"Soon, the chef will be making diners smile on a daily basis again, and he couldnt be happier at the prospect of getting back to the hustle and bustle of the kitchen - no matter how hectic it gets.\"Its exciting to be cooking again. I always enjoy full-on busy, busy restaurants, I love the adrenaline of that,\" Franklin says, as we wind up our chat. \"I think Im not built for sitting down, like an office environment - its not in me.The Pie Room by Calum Franklin, photography by John Carey, is published by Bloomsbury Absolute, priced pound .

MUSIC IS THE WEAPONFollowing a five year wait, Major Lazer are back with their much-anticipated album Music Is The Weapon.Its ato reggae and dancehall inspired sounds for the electronic trio.Dancefloor fillers Sun Comes Up - featuring Busy Signal, the vocalist from  hit Watch Out For This- and Tiny are loud, colourful and vibrant, the hallmark of Major Lazers previous successes.With ing collaborators as well as new ones, group members Diplo, Walshy Fire and Ape Drums have invited a star-studded list of featuring artists to mark their .Nicki Minaj and Mr Eazi bring the energy to bouncy, dancehall-tinged Oh My Gawd, while heartful vocalist Khalid slows the tempo in Trigger.But its the influences of reggaeton in the albums latter half, including tracks with Latin artists Paloma Mami and J Balvin, which bring the fire to Music Is The Weapon.Whether it was worth waiting half a decade for is debatable.But for fans of Major Lazers international genre-shting sound, the album acts as a weapon in battling against what is likely to be a bleak winter.Review by Emma BowdenGORILLAZ - SONG MACHINE: SEASON ONE - STRANGE TIMEZThe latest offering from Gorillaz, the worlds most famous animated four-piece, is erratic, disconnected and at times quite chaotic, which is exactly why its excellent.Song Machine: Season One - Strange Timez combines a myriad of genres, sounds and styles with a formidable selection of guest artists, producing an album that has something for everyone.We get pulsing, reverb-heavy beats on Pac-Man , punchy, frantic rock drumming on Momentary Blissand even a melancholic power ballad in The Pink Phantom .The distinctive croon of mastermind Damon Albarn comes through sporadically but only to complement the scores of big-hitting guest artists - from Robert Smith to Skepta - who each bring a dferent vibe and personality to their track.Unlike previous albums Demon Days and Plastic Beach there is no single theme or sound to Song Machine, which might not be to everyones taste but is sure to appeal to those who like a bit of everything.Review by Michael BediganRUSSELL WATSON - Russell Watson has been on quite a journey since his debut album, The Voice, was released in May .The English tenor rose from singing standards in backstreet clubs around the North West to performing to thousands at Wembley Arena.Now , he has overcome two brain tumours through extensive rehabilitation.With , which marks the two decades since his debut, Watson celebrates his remarkable journey with a mix of crowdpleasers and personal cuts.Well-worn pieces like Nessun Dorma, a slow-motion version of Volare and half-covers of themes from Gladiator and Enterprise will keep the listener tuned in.For long-standing fans, each song will have signicance.Nessun Dorma, the aria from Giacomo Puccinis opera Turandot, helped launch Watsons career.Recorded during lockdown with Watsons producer in his native New Zealand, a socially distanced orchestra in Christchurch, and Watson himself in Wilmslow, proceedings were organised over Skype.The result is a polished affair that serves more as a victory lap than an exercise in innovation.Review by Alex GreenJOE BONAMASSA - ROYAL TEAFour months after releasing Dions excellent Blues With Friends album on his KTBA label, Joe Bonamassa further celebrates his influences on Royal Tea.This time the inspiration is the s British blues albums he stumbled upon as a -year-old in his fathers vinyl collection, by Jeff Beck, John Mayall And The Bluesbreakers, and Eric Clapton and Cream.He flew to London in January just before lockdown to record at Abbey Road Studios, and the album cover proclaims \"Made in England\" and features a teapot and two teacups.Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden co-writes several songs, with Cream lyricist Pete Brown, Jools Holland and Dave Stewart also contributing to the  original tracks.The epic, seven-and-a-half minute album opener When The Door Opens builds from brooding beginnings to a Led Zeppelin-style stormer with pulverising drums and screaming guitar solo, before an acoustic coda.The title track adds swirling organ and female backing vocals to surely the first blues song inspired by a Piers Morgan segment on Good Morning Britain on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepping back as senior royals.Single Why Does It Take So Long To Say Goodbye is a break-up ballad, Bonamassa warning \"when I leave, I leave for good, no coming back, like you said I would\".Lookout Man starts with growling bass and ominous harmonica, launching into a radio-friendly chorus, and High Class Girl is a classic RB strut, while A Conversation With Alice s across the pond, referencing the Southern US sound of Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers Band.Mellow closer Savannah features Bonamassa on mandolin and Reese Wynans on organ and Wurlitzer, and showcases once more the albums fresh take on the source material.Review by Matthew George"},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-pumpkin-sage-risotto","story":"Serves  -

Outside the kitchen window the back green looks asa thousand boxes of large cornflakes have been spilled across it cars that are parked nearby overnight drive off in the morning with a mosaic of leaves stuck to their windscreens.Beneath the spreading horse chestnut, the split shells of conkers lie like our answer to coconuts, white, gleaming and empty. For the past couple of weeks children have been throwing up sticks to dislodge beauties, or sitting on their mumsrsquo and dadsrsquo shoulders, straining to reach higher fruit. The chestnutrsquos splayed leaves mock their outstretched fingers, in giant gloves as drawn by Quentin Blake.The Borders are ablaze with colours of a tint seen only on Van Goghrsquos palette. It is spectacular and, in this of all years, the sight of woodland turned into a paintbox could not be a more timely pick-me-up. Yet even as I write, leaves flutter downward, dislodged by blackbirds or by the pull of October gravity. By the time yoursquore reading this, some trees will be almost bare. In the back garden, the whitebeam is shaking its head, scattering oval ribbed leaves over the grass. Whenever I sweep up, therersquos plenty more where they came from. Itrsquos a task I enjoy, a sort of horticultural hoovering although, unlike some, we donrsquot have a leaf blower. I prefer the swish of the rake and gathering armfuls, along with windfall apples nibbled by birds and mice.Irsquove always loved late autumn, but its arrival is less welcome than usual. Most poetry, as in Keatsrsquo famous ode, glories in the abundance of colour and atmosphere, although WH Auden is as miserablist as they come in Autumn Song. More appropriate this year, to my mind, is Louis MacNeicersquos Autumn Journal, which I spent a rainy afternoon reading. Previously Irsquod only known a few lines, often read aloud by my husband, who knows parts of it by heart: ldquoAnd August going out to the tin trumpets of nasturtiums And the sunflowersrsquo Salvation Army blare of brass. The whole work is an immersion in desperate times in Europe, as observed by a man too young to offer much hope.Autumn Journal was written as the summer of  turned to winter, during which the Munich Agreement was settled, and the Spanish Civil War began stuttering to its end. MacNeice was in London and his evocations of the city and his own affairs over the months to New Year are vivid and sombre. For all its picaresque observations, this is a profound, plangent and foreboding piece of work. While he wrote, he could not have known that one year later the country, and much of the world, would be at war. Nevertheless, intimations of menace underlie its mood. Many of its lines could have been written for our present predicament, not just Covid but also Brexit: ldquoConferences, adjournments, ultimatums, Flights in the air, castles in the air The autopsy of treaties, dynamite under the bridges, The end of laissez faire.In MacNeicersquos epic poem, as today, autumn reaches into the heart of every city but in the countryside it is all-pervasive, and offers a misleading sense of normality. Tractors rattle past, their trailers heaped with potatoes so pungent you can smell them from a distance. On the main road out of the village earlier in the week an escaped bull, a Belted Galloway, created a logjam. Grazing by the roadside, he could not be budged. It was two hours before he could be coaxed back into his field and traffic could get by once again. I see he had been put into solitary confinement, well away from the heers and calves.Meanwhile, gardens are being put to bed or, in our case, allowed to stay up a little too late, as we catch up on a backlog of muddy duties, among them planting bulbs. This involves the almost industrial-scale removal of stones as, inch by inch, we reclaim the garden from its subcutaneous layer of rubble. As I was in the process of doing this, half the village seemed to pass and pause for a chat. It was a heart-warming glimmer of the old days, when people would often meet up for coffee, or gin, and jamboree in the village hall. With falling temperatures and heavy rain, all of that has fallen into abeyance and the lack is sorely felt.With Hallowersquoen approaching, carved pumpkins are beginning to appear on windowsills. They are the embodiment of autumn, night-time suns that banish the gloom and merrily brighten the darkening evenings. As I was thinking of carving one of my own for the doorstep, I found YouTube filled with the most gruesome examples, which turn fun into horror as big pumpkins crunch screaming baby pumpkins, or have their heads split open, allowing their seedy ldquobrains to spill out. I know this is the season of ghouls, but Irsquoll be putting a smiley face on mine.Listening to the news, itrsquos hard to believe that the crisis looming over us will one day be history. MacNeice was living in far graver times than ours and, while the present predicament is deeply worrying, his era puts ours in perspective. ldquoSleep to the noise of running water Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep  This is no river of the dead or Lethe,  To-night we sleep On the banks of Rubicon ndash the die is cast There will be time to audit The accounts later, there will be sunlight later And the equation will come out at last.He was, of course, right. Just as Derek Mahon, who died at the start of this month, was right when he wrote his popular poem, Everything Is Going To Be All Right. This injunction to optimism, written  years ago when he was very ill, was often quoted as the pandemic took hold: ldquoThere will be dying, there will be dying,  but there is no need to go into that.Like MacNeice, Mahon calls on the sun for solace. ldquoThe sun rises in spite of everything, he writes. As I type, the late morning sun comes and goes. When it breaks through the clouds and hits the trees and the carpet of leaves at their feet, the golden light is dazzling."},{"url":null,"title":"tangible-sign-good-can-travail-malice","story":"LAST Saturday , on the th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, the UN confirmed that the  Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weaponshad been ratied by its th state party, Honduras, and will therefore enter into international legal force  days later, on January . This Treaty bans nuclear weapons production, testing, possession and use, along with other activities that could enable and assist anyone to acquire or use these weapons of mass destruction ever again.International Campaign Against Nuclear WeaponsSteering Group member and coordinator of ICAN in Scotland, Janet Fenton, summed up the feelings of many: ldquoThe Scottish Peace Covenant expressed our desire for a Scotland that can contribute to international peace and justice, rather than being a launch pad for waging war. Now that aspiration is within our grasp. The TPNW shows the will of the sane majority of the world, and will ensure that we have unambiguous protection under international law when we stand strong in demonstrating our desire for nuclear disarmament and peace.Dr Rebecca Johnson, first president of ICAN welcomed the treaty. ldquoIt exists now because of  years of humanitarian activism, from the ldquoHibakusha and indigenous survivors of nuclear weapons and testing, to the Aldermaston marchers and Greenham Common Peace Women who helped to ban nuclear testing and get cruise missiles banned and off the roads.Since its inception in the early s, Medact, then the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons, the British affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War , has been working to rid the world of nuclear weapons and to make the world a better, fairer, safer place. IPPNW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in  and the work has continued since with Medact, including Medact Scotland, a partner organisation of ICAN which, in , was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize..As coordinator of Medact Scotland I am delighted that, as a culmination of the hard work of many, many organisations, politicians and committed iniduals, the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has been ratied. Amidst all the dire threats to the climate, freedom, democracy and epidemic safety that we, as the international community, are dealing with at the moment, this is a piece of extremely positive news. When, in  days, the treaty comes into force, the world will have taken a major step away from the brink of nuclear catastrophe.I have rarely been prouder to be part of the international peace movement. The ratication of this treaty shows that good can prevail over malice, and that the international community can come together effectively, despite forces trying to thwart it, to prioritise safety and compassion. Sadly, existing nuclear weapons states, including, shamefully, the UK, have for the most part refused to engage with it and the US has even attempted to pressurise states that have already ratied to withdraw.But it is now possible to imagine the day when the world will be free of weapons of mass destruction. As health professionals, it is our duty to care, not only for inidual patients, but for the wider international community and the planet, and to engage in the work to eliminate weapons which would destroy it. There is a lot of work still to do but, today, we have a lot to celebrate.Dr Lesley Morrison is a retired GP and coordinator of Medact Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-return-bruce-springsteen-e-street-band","story":"The man they call The Boss turned  last month, but a new album and documentary prove the years have not diminished him in the slightest.Whatrsquos the album called Letter To You. Itrsquos Springsteenrsquos twentieth studio album but his first with the famous E Street Band in over half a decade. Containing  tracks, three of which are re-worked version of previously unreleased songs from the early s, it was released last Friday and has been met with instant critical acclaim in most quarters. Themes include ageing, friendship, mortality and, of course, a love of music for the sense of connection and solace it can provide in dark times.Whatrsquos so good about it Well the presence of the E Street Band ndash members include Nils Lofgren, Garry Tallent and Steve Van Zandt ndash always makes a Springsteen album a bit special, as does reworked versions of earlier songs. But the albumrsquos genesis has a bearing too: inspired in part by the death of an old bandmate, in part by the gt of an acoustic guitar from a fan, it was recorded in just four days at Springsteenrsquos home.And the documentary Also titled Letter To You, it was filmed at the same time and shows The Boss and his bandmates in the process of recording the album and features performances of  of the songs on it. Itrsquos shot in gritty black and white, of course, narrated by Springsteen and dedicated to the You of the title ndash the fans and music lovers who have sustained the legendary rocker across his long and storied career.

But despite being released just days before the US Presidential election, Letter To You isnrsquot overtly political. That said, Springsteen did tell an Australian newspaper recently thatTrump wins the election he is going to move to Australia, inspiring the NME headline lsquoMelbourne To Run rsquo.Any other revelations The music of smoky-voiced pop chanteuse Lana Del Rey doesnrsquot seem like the sort of thing The Boss would kick back with in his down time.

The No side won and there were no complaints from the Yes side.Now that the polls are showing independence supporters to be in a clear majority the only reason that Unionist camp want to change the question is to cause confusion.What could be clearer than the original question James Duncan, Edinburgh EH.GUY Stenhouse spews nonsense. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings are not giving greater powers to Scotland but rather are using the Brexit disaster to ram through the Internal Market Bill that destroys devolution and s all powers to a Westminster dominated by  English MPs.The bill will negatively impact Scotlands food quality, environment, education standards, law, the NHS, and even our water. An unelected quango can over-rule the Scottish Parliament, force fracking and take Scotland to court to give foreign companies access to the NHS. London wonrsquot replace the annual pound. billion Scotland receives from the EU structural fund with its paltry shared prosperity fund where the spending will be determined by Westminster with a Union flag slapped on for good measure. Condemnation of this shameless power grab has come from the NFU, TUC, STUC and the House of Lords.Mr Stenhouse says Scotland is drawing on the financial strength of the UK during this pandemic when our dependency on Westminster precludes the Scottish Government from borrowing the money to, for example, extend the furlough scheme to save thousands of jobs, as other European countries are doing. Instead, we are reduced to begging Rishi Sunak tosome of the billions we send to London to stave off economic collapse. An independent Scotlandrsquos central bank would keep its wealth, borrow the money to support its people through this crisis and invest in future growth areas like renewable energy.He refers to \"our signicant budget deficit\", when Scotland has to balance its budget and canrsquot overspend. The \"deficit\" is created by our London masters who burden us with multiple UK-wide costs we donrsquot control, including pound.bn per annum to service a UK debt we didnrsquot create nor benefit from.Words do matter. Thatrsquos why the only fair question is: ldquoShould Scotlandrsquos independence be restored  Only by restoring Scottish independence can we make our own decisions and not be ruled by a distant government that holds us back and treats us with contempt.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.GUY Stenhouse states correctly that the way a question is phrased can bias the result, which he summarises as \"words matterrsquorsquo.Sadly, he is happy to use facts which are of dubious validity to back up his arguments. Let me take issue with some of them.First, apart from right-wing apologists, most commentators think that the UK Internal Market Bill will diminish rather than increase devolved powers.Secondly, he thinks that the UK is a strong player in international financial markets. Does this explain why the pound would buy   years ago and will buy . today Thirdly, and most surprisingly, he quotes a recent poll that states that % more Scots favour remaining in the UK than leaving. I have looked for this poll and failed to find it.Facts matter too, Mr Stenhouse.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.ALEX Salmondrsquos lawyer has called on the Scottish Government to publish the legal advice that it receivedbecause there is a clear public interest in reading and understanding why it spent large sums of taxpayersrsquo money in defending his court action before conceding defeat.Those who understand the court process know that legal costs increase dramatically in the lead-up to a full hearing.The Government had the benefit of advice from external lawyers, including a prominent senior counsel. Clearly it was told at some point that its position was untenable and required to be conceded. That concession took place only on January , , one week before the full hearing date and months after the action had been raised..If the Government delayed in accepting the legal advice which it had been given , that delay cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, not only in respect of Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs but the bill the Government incurred to its own lawyers.The Scottish taxpayers, as the ones who footed the bill for all of this, are surely entitled to know.George Moore, Glasgow G.Read more:Guy Stenhouse: Words matter and the independence question should be a dferent one"},{"url":null,"title":"perth-kinross-seen-increase-dirty-camping","story":"Perth and Kinross councillors will meet tomorrow to discuss plans to tackle issues with dirty camping.The scenic region has seen a dramatic increase in visitors as a result of the COVID- pandemic.PKC is now putting plans in place to deal with an anticipated increase in visitor numbers next year and prioritise hotspot areas for action.Councillors on PKCrsquos environment and infrastructure committee will meet virtually on Wednesday to discuss the issue.A council report to the committee outlines plans to deal with the increased number of visitors to Perthshirersquos many beauty spots.The council is taking a multi-agency approach to tackling the problems which have arisen from the ldquoanti-social behaviour of a very small proportion.The report highlights issues with parking, littering fly-tipping,damage , human waste,unattended campfires as well as other anti-social behaviour fuelled by alcohol consumption.Earlier this year a multiagency working group was established which met weekly to review the previous weekrsquos issues and take action ahead of the following week.The working group comprised of Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Forestry and Land Scotland, Loch Rannoch Conservation Association and several PKC services:Community Greenspace, Parking Services, Safer Communities Wardens and Waste Services.

BxldquoI trust this is of assistance to the committee.Ms Evansrsquos text, which was refer has fuelled claims Mr Salmond was the victim of a politically motivated plotby senior people in the Government and SNP to stop him making a comeback and rivalling his successor.Ms Evans denied this when recalled to give an oral evidence last month.She said: ldquoI think that has been misinterpreted as having some kind of conspiratorial element to it. Can I clearly say that is not the case I was not referring to any inidual when I sent that text. I was referring to a long-term commitment of mine, and indeed of the Scottish Government, as you will see from its policy documents, to ensure that equality lies at the heart of what it does.Asked by Tory MSP Murdo Frasershe had been ldquoat war with Alex Salmond, Ms Evans replied: ldquoNo.Ms Sturgeon has also dismissed the conspiracy theoryas a ldquoheap of nonsense.The inquiry is today taking evidence from Judith MacKinnon, the investigating officer in theprobe, whose prior contact with Mr Salmonds accusers led to the collapse of the Governments case.She denied having any doubts about being appointed investigating officer in January  despite her contacts, which she said were appropriate.She also strongly denied pre-judging the claims against Mr Salmond."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-ross-marcus-rashfords-school-meals-campaign-nothing-short-extraordinary","story":"The UK Conservative party has come under fire in the last week after  of its MPs voted against allocatingpound-a-week food vouchers for impoverished children over the school holidays.However, Moray MP Douglas Ross has stated his position, saying that the Scottish Tories back the plan, and have called on the Scottish Government to go further.Earlier this month, Scotlandrsquos Social Security Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, announced more than pound million for the extension of free school meals during the Christmas, February and Easter breaks, as well as reimbursements to local authorities which offer support during the October holiday.:Scots Tory leader Douglas Ross explains why he failed to vote for free school mealsIn September, the Scottish Tory leader announced that his party would push for free breakfasts and lunches in every Scottish primary school.Writing in the Daily , Mr Ross said: ldquoMy reasoning was partly because itrsquos good policy ndash no child learns well when theyrsquore not well-fed.He added: ldquoBy providing free school meals universally, my party reasoned, we could make sure that no pupil is left behind, as they have been far too often under the SNP.Mr Ross also said that his motherrsquos work as a school dinner lady had pushed him to act, showing ldquothe good that providing pupils with healthy, nutritious food can do.The party will now push for a vote in Holyrood on implementing his policy, the leader said, adding: ldquoIrsquom going to keep cheering on Marcus Rashfordrsquos campaign in England.ldquoBut in Scotland, wersquore going to go much further and force the SNP to act on his example ndash by deeds, not just words.Praising the Manchester United and England striker, Mr Ross ndash a part-time assistant referee ndash said: ldquoIrsquove seen -year-olds score for Manchester United and England before ndash thatrsquos impressive but itrsquos not extraordinary.ldquoRashfordrsquos political campaigns have been nothing short of extraordinary.ldquoTheyrsquore classy, professional, and he consistently keeps out of all the usual political mud-slinging that a campaign like this sometimes engages in.The Scottish Tory leader refused to vote on a motion put forward by Labour in the House of Commons last week, justying his decision by saying it would only affect England.However, the five other Scottish Tory MPs in Westminster voted against the motion to support Rashfordrsquos campaign, something which Mr Ross said would not happen again.He said: ldquoItrsquos been reported that some of our other MPs did take part. That will no longer be the practice going forward.

The important Highlands route has been open for barely three weeks since August  when a landslip brought about by rain blocked the A.A safety inspection will take place at first light each morning ahead of a potential reopening on the A under traffic signal control.Maintenance firm BEAR Scotland said that as a result of the landslips in August and September, the slopes situated above the A at the Rest have been left \"heavily scarred\" and exposed to further erosion, with loose material present both on the hillside and within the newly formed channel directly above the road.The behaviour of the hillside and the newly formed channel has been closely monitored for movement by geotechnical specialists since the landslips occurred, with the road opening based on these inspections.#A #RestAndBeThankful: A to close each night from pm as safety precaution until current phase of mitigation measures complete on the hillside in late November.

With the in-channel barrier in place it is also envisaged that the A will be \"more resilient\" for operation during darkness under traffic light control.The firm said closing the A at pm each night from today until late November will allow for \"reliable journey times\" for road users travelling on the A and allow them to plan accordingly to account for the Old Military road local ersion route.Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotlandrsquos north west representative said: ldquoWersquore continuing to put motorist safety first, and as more seasonal wet weather approaches we have taken the decision to close the A each night from pm overnight as a safety precaution.ldquoThe Old Military Road will be used overnight for all road users with an inspection taking place at first light in the morning ahead of a potential reopening on the A under traffic signal control.ldquoAlready over the past week wersquove seen the challenges that normal autumnal weather is presenting with the current condition of the hillside at the Rest.ldquoWith more rain forecast this week, we need to ensure wersquore doing everything we can to protect road users.

Initially, people from dferent households wouldnot be able to go insideeach others homes.However in-home meetings of six people from two households could be allowed later.Level two would entail

equivalent to the tougher restrictions that currently apply across the Central Belt.Hospitality rules will be slightly loosened, however.Under the new system set out by the Scottish Government, level

about the meetings, but the Scottish Government conceded its legal fight with the former first minister before it could happen, it has emerged.Ms Sturgeonrsquos chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, had also been due to be questioned, but that too was called off.The meetings between Mr Somers and Mr Salmondrsquos accuser were only revealed after the Scottish Government belatedly released documents it had failed to produce previouslydespite a court order.: Alex Salmond inquiry: Nicola Sturgeons government accused of outrageous smear bidIn new evidence to the Holyrood inquiry into the Salmond affair, Mr Salmondrsquos lawyeralso reveals the Government produced material just last week that should have been disclosedalmost a year ago, during preparations for Mr Salmonds separate criminal trial.The inquiry is investigating how the Scottish Government botched a probe into claims of sexual misconduct made against Mr Salmond in January .The former FM had theexercise set aside in a judicial review, showing it had been ldquotainted by apparent bias, leaving taxpayers with a pound, bill for his costs.The Government admitted defeat in the civil action in January .Mr Salmondrsquos supporters claim he was the victim of a political conspiracy by Government and SNP figures to stop him making a comeback and rivalling his successor.In a letter shared with the inquiry, Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer, David McKie of Levy  McRae, explained why Mr Somers was relevant to a a series of court hearings in late  at which documents were recovered from the Government and officials asked about them.He said: ldquoDocuments appeared from the Scottish Government which had previously not been produced, despite a Court ordering that they be so.ldquoSome of those documents confirmed that one of the complainers had met with the Private Secretary to the First Minister on two occasions in November .ldquoOn the second occasion, another inidual was also present.The identity of the second inidual is not known to us.ldquoIt was Senior Counselrsquos intention to ask that question of the Chief of Staff, Liz Lloyd and the Private Secretary, John Somers, when those witnesses came before the [court].ldquoBefore either could give evidence, the petition was conceded by the Scottish Government.:Alex Salmond inquiry: Astonishment as half-million pound flaw still not fixedIn another letter sent to the Scottish Government yesterday, Mr McKie also complained aboutthe very late appearance of an annex attached to the Governments latest timeline of events ldquopurporting to be a note from James Hynd, the official who helped drafta new Government harassment procedure in late  which was then applied to Mr Salmond.The note refers to the all-important Paragraph  of the procedure, which was at the heart of Mr Salmondrsquos judicial review win.The paragraph states that the investigating officer in any case ldquowill have had no prior involvement with any aspect of the matter being raised.However the Government appointed an investigating officerwho had been in prior discussion with Mr Salmondrsquos two accusers.It was this prior involvement which gave rise to the appearance of bias in the probe.In the note, dated  November , during the judicial review process, Mr Hynd arguedParagraph was ldquonot meant to preclude an IO being appointed who had some foreknowledge of the circumstances of the complaint as long as that foreknowledge would not compromise the IOrsquos ability to be an impartial collector of facts, and as long as the IO had no direct involvement in the matter around the time it occurred.Mr McKie told the Government: ldquoThis document does not appear to have been disclosed to us at any stage. That was clearly within the terms of the warrant served on the Scottish Government in November . Please provide an explanation for its omission.ldquoOur clientrsquos whole rights are meantime reserved, including the right to raise this matter with the crown.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoThis is an absolutely extraordinary attack from Mr Salmondrsquos lawyers on the governmentrsquos failure to disclose documents and their secretive approach to this inquiry.ldquoWersquove now heard of even more information that the SNP Government tried to keep hidden. ldquoThey apparently didnrsquot reveal a key document that should have been disclosed.ldquoAnd itrsquos the first time wersquove heard of secret meetings between Nicola Sturgeonrsquos trusted civil servant and private secretary, John Somers, and one of the people who reported Alex Salmondrsquos alleged behaviour to the government.ldquoThe government must come cleanMr Somers knew of these complaints in November  and tell us about the other official who was in the second meeting.ldquoThese explosive letters have uncovered yet more secret meetings and information that the SNP Government tried to cover up. It seems they will stop at nothing to keep their mistakes quiet.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ldquoThe publication of letters from the lawyers representing Alex Salmond have effectively thrown the gauntlet down to the Scottish Government, challenging them to disclose information in relation to the judicial review.ldquoThe Scottish Government need to get on with it and publish their legal advice otherwise they will be forced to do so.Shortly after Mr Salmond won the judicial review he was wcharged with sexual assault, leading to a trial earlier this year at which he was acquitted on all counts."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-voters-must-envy-governments-nations","story":"It is all very well for Mr McKie to claim that Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, had \"the good luck\" to miss the vote in the Commons, but he fails to mention that the other five of Scotlands Tory MPs did vote against providing vulnerable children in England with free meals during the school holidays.However, Mr McKie is right when he points out that it is alarming that the Tory Government \"seems not to have the common sense to see huge great bear traps that are right in front of it\". Whether it is its policies on hungry children, the EU, or chopping and changing its strategy over the coronavirus, the Tories lurch from one crisis to the next, and English voters, lagging behind, must look with envious eyes towards the sensible and compassionate governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Ruth Marr, Stirling.FOR obvious reasons, some of your correspondentsare keen to repeat the same simple Yes No question asked in  in any second independence referendum, this despite the Electoral Commissionrsquos advice that there is an inherent bias in favour of the positivity of Yes against the negativity of No. Recognition of this potential bias led to the Remain  Leave question in the referendum on EU membership .Whilst dismissing or ignoring the Electoral Commissionrsquos advice as presumably somehow irrelevant and definitely unhelpful to their cause, no doubt they still consider themselves to be democrats seeking a fair outcome. If so, perhaps they would care to share their view of an equally simple but potentially biased Yes No question along the lines of ldquoShould Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom \". This question does benefit also from not being tainted by any misleading reference to ldquoindependence as the alternative to being part of the UK is apparently to switch dependency to that consequential on being part of the EU .If there is ever to be any Indyref, it is not obvious that the fairest question to be asked should call for a simple remain leave answer as in the EU referendum Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.THE coronavirus pandemic has revealed the dangers of the Conservative obsession with privatisation and of the shortcomings of the private sector compared with the professionalism of the NHS staff.The situation is exacerbated by the Government opening itself to legitimate questioning about its procedures in relation to the awarding of coronavirus-related contracts to Conservative friends and donors.Philip Rycroft, who served as Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union from  to , asserted that the best responses to Covid- were from nations which have seen ldquomore devolution of power and responsibility and obligations to the local level.He called for ldquoproper devolution of power and responsibility to the appropriate level in England, as well as to the devolved parts of the UK to preserve the Union and to build more effective public services. Furthermore I quote Gordon Brown: ldquothe whole United Kingdom will have to change fundamentally - from top to bottom -our regions are to feel at home andScotland is to remain within it.In relation to the specic matter of Scotlandrsquos place in the UK I suggest that the unionists who really care about the Union listen to Cambridge University Professor Helen Thompson arguing that ldquowe must find our collective way to a settlement that allows for Anglo-Scottish ergence without leading to constitutional crisis. Of course, the problem is too many of these unionists follow blindly Boris Johnsonrsquos resentment of such ergence as there already is.John Milne, Uddingston.DAVID Bolrsquos exposure of Professor Mark Priestlyrsquos analysis of the exam results scandalagain raised the question: do we Scots live in a democracy any more Mr Bol wrote that Prof Priestly found that Mr Swinney had asked officials on August  to ldquodo lots of digging in the stats to show how young people from deprived backgrounds had not been disadvantaged by the results. Readers will recall that the hapless Education Secretary was forced to do a U-turn some time later because all the evidence was to the contrary. Just as concerning was the evidence that parents, worried out of their minds, wrote letters to Mr Swinney questioning his fitness to do the job.I can hardly believe that these same concerned Scots were not writing letters to newspapers expressing the same opinion. I do not recall a single one being published. My own attempts to draw attention to comparisons of more affluent areas in Scotland with shocking results in excellent schools in Coatbridge and Airdrie were simply spiked. I wrote to several newspapers .I hold no candle for Andrew Neil, whose political views are well known. However, he proved to be objective, fair, and prescient in countless television interviews. Surely he had a point when even he appealed to the Scottish media to show some backbone in questioning the record of the SNP as its incompetence and duplicity goes largely unchallenged The public are entitled to know more about why our rates of infection and deaths from Covid are still among the highest in the developed world. Similarly, they are entitled to see journalistic forensic examinations of the care home scandals, the debacle over ferry contracts, the decimation of Scottish local government, and the abuse of taxpayersrsquo money to pursue a man judged by the law to be innocent for the purposes apparently of personal aggrandisement. That this is not happening is cause for deepest concern.Tom Clarke, former Labour MP, Coatbridge.IT was, I thought, common knowledge that there was no state pension \"potrsquorsquo and that pension payments were made from incoming National Insurance contributions and taxes. But time and time again, Scottish nationalists infer there is some mythical giant piggy bank somewhere holding all the contributions made over the years.Pensions and benefits are paid to UK citizens from incoming contributions. If the contributions suddenly and catastrophically drop, for examplefive million of the  million covered decide to break off and go it alone, then of course there will be a price to pay. The new five million entity would have to pay for the pensions and benefits of their own old and vulnerable and the burden would not be shared across  million.It is serious misleading to suggest that somehow pensions and benefits in a broken-off Scotland could be maintained without severe economic pain.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.Read more: Letters: The Yes No question was clear and should be used again"},{"url":null,"title":"putin-president-xi-kim-jong-un-want-win-not-good-thing-watch-barack-obama-campaigns-joe-biden-florida","story":"Taking to the stage in Florida, the former president hit out at Donald Trump for \"bragging\" about having Putin, President Xi and Kim Jong Un wanting him to win.ldquoOur current president, he whines that lsquo Minutesrsquo is too tough, Obama said, referring to Trumprsquos recent interview with the CBS program. ldquoYou think hersquos going to stand up to dictators  He thinks Leslie Stahlrsquos a bully.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Obama campaigns for Joe Biden in Florida\",\"description\": \"Obama campaigns for Joe Biden in Florida\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media efZzGxay poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests efZzGxay.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :US Election Day : When is it, how does voting work and what time will we get results Obama then noted that ldquojust yesterday, he said that Putin of Russia, Xi of China and Kim Jong Un of North Korea want him to win.ldquoWe know!

Opening today#s debate on the framework at Holyrood,  Ms Sturgeon set out a rough plan for how the government believes tiered restrictions should be ided between regions.Orkney, along with the Highland, Shetland, the Western Isles and Moray, may go straight to Level One.Official confirmation of which levels will apply to each locality is not due to be made until Friday. However, headlines nationwide have reported that a leaked letter sent by the government to the Convention of Scottish Local Authoritiesgave a clear indication of which restrictions will be applied in each area.In the case of Orkney, it was reported that the county may be placed under Level One of the new tiered restrictions. The First Minister’s speech, this afternoon, Tuesday, appeared to endorse these reports.Level One restrictions are broadly in line with measures as they stand, although it may allow for the reopening of some hospitality venues, and more socialising between households.The new strategy comes into force on Monday, November .In the meantime, the debate in parliament is ongoing, and MSPs are due to vote on the framework, later this evening.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With each user given a “for you” page — a never-ending feed of videos tailored by an algorithm of your tastes — Maddie has been able to break through the boundaries of living on an island, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers from across the globe.Recalling the excitement of that first viral video, she told The Orcadian: “When I posted it, it was starting to do well, and it was quite exciting. I was saying to my mum and my step-dad, ‘Look, it’s got over , views — what’s happening !’ And then I woke up in the middle of the night, and it was two or three in the morning, and I had loads of messages from my friends, so I had a feeling that it had done pretty well. So I went onto TikTok and it was just over two million views.“Since that, it’s just kind of taken off. In the last five or six months, it has just kept growing. I’ve got around , followers, which is just mad!“I’ve been doing a lot of work with brands, which is amazing.”Maddie, who has been sent products and offers from big-name brands such as River Island, Bondi Sands, and BaByliss, has been able to make money and gain more recognition for her videos as the months have gone on.As well as showcasing her “glow up” skills, the -year-old has also been able to push forward her long-term goal of becoming a professional actress, with a series of performance videos showing off her acting and dancing talent.Indeed, Maddy has already taken several calls from television producers as a result of her TikTok success. She told The Orcadian that she recently received an offer to be on the risqué Channel Four dating show, Naked Attraction — which she quickly declined — and also turned down an offer for ITV’s Dressed to Impress.“I don’t knowreality TV is the route I want to go down,” explained Orkney’s TikTok star, who is currently looking into options for drama school.“I mean, in a few years that might change — but right now, I definitely have other goals and ambitions. I think once you’ve done a show like Love Island, for example, I think it’s very hard to get away from that name.“It’s always a bit daunting, being in a small community and wanting to do something that’s maybe a bit outside the box and a bit dferent. But people have been really lovely and really supportive, which I’ve appreciated, and I have so many messages from so many girls — and boys — in Orkney and Shetland, thanking me for doing something dferent and putting myself out there. Once someone puts themselves out there, it becomes a little bit more acceptable and a little bit more okay.“I’ve noticed it — people from here putting themselves out there that little bit more, which has been really nice to see.”You can find Maddie’s videos on her TikTok page @mmaddiehillcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Most recently,  Luskentyre, which has two bedrooms, was placed on the market for offers over £,. Substantially renovated, the house was advertised as a “turnkey second home or holiday let business for the next owners”. that at the time of the community buy out in , second home ownership was a “key concern” of the organisation.“Indeed, it was one of the factors that motivated the community to act,” he added. “The community recognised the unsustainable nature of the situation at that time, with  per cent of the houses in west Harris either holiday homes or self-catering cottages.”Over the last  years that figure has increased, prompting the trust to call for west Harris to become a ‘control area’, where houses used for holiday letting would require planning consent. This is one of the proposals the Scottish Government consulted on.Mr Campbell added: “We should make it clear that we actively support crofters residing on the estate ersying into tourism to provide an income to enable them to continue to live, or in some casesto west Harris.“The trust has released land in conjunction with the grazing committees for self-build, and in partnership with Hebridean Housing Partnership. Six houses for rent and four houses under shared ownership have been built, resulting in the population increasing by  per cent over the  years of ownership.”However, the trust remains concerned that the ever-increasing prices being realised for crofts and houses make it very dficult for young people to remain in the community.“It is hoped that this legislation can be used to keep existing houses under permanent residence rather than becoming holiday homes,” Mr Campbell added.After analysing the consultation’s finding, the Scottish Government will introduce the agreed changes in April of next year."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Scotland-Football-Team-credit-SCOTLANDNATIONALTEAM-TWITTER-web.jpg","title":"why i have stopped watching scotland at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY NORRIE T MACDONALDSpeaking last week about how football, the only sport I really thought I knew anything about, had undergone such a radical transformation, made me examine my perceptions about other sports.When it comes to their rules, am I completely at ease that I actually know what’s going on Heck no. Are you Football used to be very basic and straightforward, offside was the only really complicated bit and I understood it perfectly when black was black and white was white: now I don’t even comprehend what it is that’s happening with the competitions that our teamsparticipate in.What were we playing in over last weekend How many back doors are we being offered now to make it to the European Championships Is it a back door What is the Nations League and how is our group made up only of ‘diddy’ teams like ourselves Why are Spain playing Portugal, England-Belgium, while we appear to be in a group with countries younger than my mother What even is the Nations League, and are UEFA  FIFA simply intent on giving every single team as many possibilities as they can to qualy for a finals, no matter how meaningless I have to be honest, I’ve stopped watching Scotland.If I don’t know most of the players, don’t understand the rules any more, and don’t know what competition we’re playing in, why would I Doubtless Steve Clarke will be put to the sword when he cannot manage to come close to manufacturing even a plastic purse from an often-depleted squad, certainly one devoid of enough major talent to progress.And repeat.Do I know what’s going on in a rugby match Calm down.I get completely flummoxed by some of the decisions and nuances of their laws.But then again, it’s not my game and the understanding of the rules of any sport where my interest is merely in the passing, often confounds my ‘enjoyment’ of it.Basketball too.I’ve even been to more Orlando Magic gamesthan I’ve attended rugby matches in my own country.But don’t even start me on their biggest sport, baseball, which is as confusing to me as backgammon and bridge combined.It’s basically a ball and a bat, running round a diamond and more statistics than are currently being thrown at us by the chief medical officer and Boris.I simply cannot get into it.But then again, I was never meant to.Where the premise is simplethen there shouldn’t be too many rules necessary to prevent us enjoying what originally started out as some fun, some exercise, a pastime.They began with just fiveand progressed to .Nowadays offside itself takes up more definition than the original five in their entirety.When it comes to golf, there is a whole handbook.A radical overhaul recently has seen some of the silliness eradicated and the original  rules, outlined in just  words, have been reduced to just a small, compact, encyclopaedia.I was recently at a golf quiz where, of the  questions asked, I was proficient in less than a third .Try explaining stableford or a par bogey competition against the course to a Martian.Give me cricket and I have a clue.It’s quite simple.I have an old, framed, tea-towel in my shed which proclaims them thus: ‘You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.‘When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.‘There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.‘When both sides have been in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!’See It’s important to know the rules, what their purpose is and how to best interpret them so as to understand what it is that’s going on in the field.Isn’t it RULES OUT THE WINDOWThe rules appear to fly out the window down at Askernish where their correspondent, captain and current winner of just about everything, happens to be the same guy.He could just be making it all up, sending me bogus reports and watching his star rise, while bewildered colleagues helplessly look on.They say that history is written by the winners, but the reality is nowadays that it is written by those with the only pen.From Colin Russell, a man who can be described in many adjectives, not all of them beginning with the same letter.Alliteration can be a tricky path.I jest, however, he indeed is having a sterling month.ROAD TO HARRISScarista on Saturday saw the second instalment of their Road to Harris competition and it was with a deal of excitement that I made it down for the first time in a month.It was blowing a hoolieand any bad hole would be quickly consigned to the bin.The par bogey format has its compensations.Winner on the day, continuing his recent fine form, was Murdo F MacLeod who finished + versus the course.He managed to prevail on countbackfrom a pack including Russell Tennant and Kenny ‘Kuna’ Morrison.Melanie Duff finished second.Congratulations are due to Grant Fulton, Scarista member and son of ‘The Bold’ for his recent elevation to elected member for the ward of Na Hearadh agus Ceann a Deas nan Loch.He won by a cricket score, no countback necessary.As an independent, he will bring a wealth of experience and expertise across a range of subjects to the

several months at a time does imbue a swing-rustiness which only lager and practice can eradicate. days quarantine doesn’t help either.One thing is for certain it doesn’t, ever, wipe the smile off his face.His -point total for a win last Wednesday contained an eagle, no less , and a scattering of par golf which contributed massively to his tally in the October stableford.Martyn Macleod required no such measuring tape to gauge the distance between himself and second place on Saturday his beautul , edging Donald ‘Sweeney’ MacSween  by clear distance.His only real blemish was an untidy double at the second.Two birdies redeemed that particular mishap, the rest of his round being constructed without any fuss or fanfare.A bonny, and accomplished, player on his day Martyn could do with more

shinty star Lorna MacRae made a debut to remember as she stole the show with a four-goal salvo to propel Inverness Caledonian Thistle Women to a - victory over Westdyke on Sunday.Lorna, who has made a name for herself as an attacking talent for both Skye Ladies Camanachd and the Scotland national team in recent years, showed her skills on the football pitch with a commanding performance as ICT women recorded an emphatic win on the opening day of the Championship North campaign.MacRae showcased her predatory instinct in front of goal in ruthless fashion by striking four times in the opening  minutes to put the contest to bed before half-time.After leaving her marker for dead following a powerful run down the left-wing, MacRae fired high into the net to open the scoring.Her second came from a finely timed run in which she burst past the Westdyke defence to latch onto a pass from deep and, unruffled by the outrushing keeper, kept her cool to slot the ball low into the net to make it -.She completed her hat-trick with another powerful shot, this time after a brilliantly cushioned pass from the right-hand side played her into the box. Taking one touch MacRae set herself up before lashing a venomous right-foot strike beyond the Westdyke keeper.Her fourth goal owed more to good positioning than style as she kept her nerve to tuck away a tap-in past the beleaguered opposition keeper.Kayleigh MacKenzie then added a fth for the Caley Jags to cap off an emphatic start to the season for the Highlanders.Commenting on MacRae’s dream debut, ICTWFC coach Karen Mason told the Free Press: “It was a very pleasing start to the season, to say the least!“Lorna’s debut couldn’t have gone any better for her, four goals within the opening  minutes with some great finishes in amongst them.She added: “She is going to be a real asset to us this season with her pace, power, and tenacity. She will definitely run defences ragged throughout the campaign.”Caley’s next fixture is scheduled for Sunday th October when they will take on Cove Rangers FCW away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PROFILE-MORAG-HANNAH-3.jpg","title":"forbes seeks radical improvement to universal credit as island claims","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY ADAM GORDONFigures from Highland Council showed a  per cent increase in claims for welfare recorded by the Portree job centre between Marchand August .Sixteen to  year-olds and - year-olds have been the worst affected groups, with the number of people within both claimant brackets having risen by more than  per cent between March and August.In the - year-old age group the figure rose by a staggering  per cent — with  claims made in March and  made in August. The number spiked at  claims in July.Meanwhile the statistics for the - year-olds category also painted a worrying trend with a  per cent rise recorded between March and August. March saw , claims made, while that number escalated to , in August.The overall figures show that Portree job centre experienced the greatest rise in claims between March and August at  per cent, with Fort William the next greatest at  per cent of the six centres listed.The total number for the Highlands as a whole climbed from , in March to , in August. The greatest figure for the region across that period came in July when the number rose to ,.On Monday, Highland Council Leader Margaret Davidson said that the region has been hit hard by the many shortfalls arising from the UK Government’s benefit scheme.Reacting to the figures, Kate Forbes said: “The pandemic has a huge social and economic impact. Many people, particularly young people, have found themselves dependent on universal credit.“Some of those who are reliant on universal credit for the first time in their lives have told me that they cannot believe the UK Government expects anybody to live off the small weekly sums.“There have been some improvements to universal credit but these have been minimal and it is critical that the UK Government not only maintains those changes, but radically improves universal credit so that families and iniduals can survive.“As redundancies increase in advance of the end of the furlough scheme, the Scottish Government has sought to provide employability support. However, it would be far better to keep people in work in the first place.She added: “If anybody is struggling to access universal credit or finds themselves with nowhere  to go, I would encourage them to get in touch with my office and I will do everything I possibly can to help.”The bureau manager at the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau has said changes need to be made to the Universal Credit system to halt the “desperate cycle of debt and destitution”.: “The Universal Credit monthly standard allowance for those aged under  years is £. – some people may get more money on top of the standard allowance – housing costs,eligible, with the claimant possibly having to wait for around five weeks for the first payment.“They can ask for an advance, but this must be paid back.“Claims for Universal Credit must normally be made and maintained online. Alternative, offline options are only available in exceptional circumstances. Many claimants are in financial dficulty before they apply for Universal Credit, with some delaying making their claim until they are in dficulty.“The department’s analysis of earnings data found that nearly half of claimants –  per cent — had no earnings in the three months before they apply for Universal Credit.“The initial five-week wait can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties.”She explained that since Universal Credit was introduced, evidence from the CAB has suggested that a signicant minority of people do not have the internet access or digital skills required to make and maintain their claims online.She said: “Within this group, those with disabilities, mental or physical health conditions, learning dficulties, poor literacy skills and other complex needs, appear to face particular disadvantages and barriers to online claim maintenance.“In fact, some simply may never be able to do so without substantial support. Those living in rural areas can also face unique dficulties. Such claimants can therefore be at serious risk of sanction , which can result in signicant hardship.“The UK government does offer an advance loan system so people can access cash sooner. But that simply adds another line of credit to people’s outgoings and pushes them further into that debt spiral. Our evidence base tells us that it is dficult to get by on Universal Credit even before your advance loan repayments are deducted.”Since th March this year the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau have dealt with , client contacts,  per cent of these contacts –  client contacts — have been with regards to Universal Credit – people looking for advice on advance payments, reporting changes of circumstances, needing assistance with claiming and backdating, getting help with the housing element, how to supply medical evidence that they are unfit to look for work, online access issues, payment issues schedules, reconsiderations and work capability assessments.Ms Hannah added: “We believe that advance loans should be replaced by a non-repayable payment system that protects the most vulnerable from destitution – like having to rely on food banks – during the waiting period.“Alongside this, it makes much more sense for people to just get their first payment sooner we say within two weeks. Provide suitable non-digital options for iniduals to make and manage their Universal Credit claims and promote these options to claimants, particularly disabled people, people with health conditions and other complex needs.“Get it wrong and we will continue to see people in the same desperate cycle of debt and destitution, but get it right and we can begin to reverse the trend of working poverty.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lochnevis-credit-Creative-CommonsThe-Carlisle-Kid.jpg","title":"small isles should not be held","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine this week, chair Camille Dressler said that residents of Eigg had at times been stuck in the middle of the local authority and the ferry operator in what she described as a “complete breakdown in communication” between the parties.At present the Small Isles are served by the MV Lochnevis vessel which launched in . However, since May the community have been lobbying for maintenance work to be carried out at Eigg harbour, as Ms Dressler explained.“As the chair of the community council, I have had numerous correspondences with the Highland Council to establish that they would stand by their statutory obligation to do a bathymetric survey — which they haven’t carried out for  years — to make sure that the approach to Eigg harbour is safe in very low tide.“There seems to be an issue of more sand being there than there used to be. There also seems to be a problem with the fenders at the pier which were reported to the harbour authority on th May and nothing was done to fix it.“There were also problems with the fenders on the harbour at Muck, and Highland Council was contracted to fix them there but neglected to fix the ones on Eigg at the same time.”She added: “I just feel that as the Highland Council is getting pier dues from CalMac, they should have a regular schedule of maintenance.“I know that the Highland Council is extremely strapped for cash, but the communities that are depending on ferries such as the Lochnevis for a leline shouldn’t be held hostage by the problems they have with the finances or the relationship they have with CalMac.”Ms Dressler said that a Highland Council contractor was now on the case, but highlighted that islanders have also been troubled by cancellations during a period in which the local economy was seeking a final boost for the year from visitors.She said: “The month of September was crucial to get a few visitors on the island and there have been cancellations left, right and centre because of bad weather, direction of wind and tidal conditions which have really created a lot hassle for customers on and off the island.”Supplies to the shop on Eigg are delivered via Mallaig, where the Spar shop receives its orders while provisions for the island are sent to the CalMac office there. However,there is a cancellation then the delivery has to be sent back to the supplier.“We are not going to starve but what is annoying is that shop orders have had to be sent back to the supplier because they can’t be delivered,” said Camille.Addressing the cancellations, she said: “We understand that CalMac won’t endanger any of its vessels — they are in such a precarious position as they don’t have any replacement. If anything happens to the Lochnevis they can’t replace it.”Ms Dressler said her contact at the council was very pleasant and quick to respond to the islanders requests but added: “What worries me is that the council seems to want to encourage the community to complain to CalMac and it’s not our place to do that.“It’s our job to make sure the schedule of maintenance is done and in a timely manner. No community complaint is going to change a master’s decision because that’s final.”She added: “We are not sure on what basis the master’s decisions are based — there are factors that are obviously beyond our knowledge but they are not communicated to the community in any great detail.”She said that CalMac representatives and members of the harbour authority appeared to have come to an agreement but added that it was “quite alarming” that Highland Council’s harbour authority had to taken so long to deal with what is a statutory obligation.Caol and Mallaig councillor Allan Henderson, who represents the Small Isles, has said that Eigg has not been caught in the middle of a debate between the local authority and CalMac and that decisions on pier repairs were down to the harbour master’s judgment.Councillor Hendersontold the Free Press that the islanders understood the council’s efforts to make sure that the piers and harbours were in top condition but said that it has not been possible due to the logistics involved.He said: “When a problem is identied and that will most likely be caused by a vessel berthing and putting strain on the fender, or whichever part it comes in contact with, the Highland Council need to instruct marine carpenters to fix.“Iniably the repairer will have a schedule of work and also needs to find a weather window to venture out into the sound. I do not believe the Eigg problem was identied when the Muck work was completed.“Even when the Eigg repair was identied the Highland Council harbour manager did not see it as an impediment to the CalMac vessel berthing, but still the repair company were once again given an instruction to mobilise and repair.”He added: “This is not the community being caught in the middle of a Highland Council-CalMac debate but rather the master making his judgement call.“While the council tries its best to have the piers and harbours in A condition, it is just not possible all the time with the logistics involved. I believe the islanders understand this.“The council have also commissioned a bathymetric survey this year to help the masters navigate the safe channels in the Small Isles harbours.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3411600.jpg--.jpg?1602676940000\n","title":"austin s cycle raises 1 580 for diabetes uk","story":"AUSTIN Graham’s  miles sponsored cycle ride has raised over pound, for Diabetes UK!The -year-old Ballymena man completed his journey last Tuesday night.“I set myself the target of  miles to be completed during the month of September,” outlined Austin.“I put the finishing touches on completing it last week and am delighted that I raised more than my original pound, target.”His total amount raised is pound,Austin, himself a diabetic, thanks everyone single person who donated.“The money is going to Diabetes UK, a very worthy cause.

But I managed to get there in the end,” he said.Being under the weather obviously put paid to some of the plans Austin had to clock up the miles.Austin has been diabetic since the age of five.In our preview back on September  we reported how Austin has always wanted to do something for the Diabetes UK cause.A couple of years ago he had plans to tackle the London to Paris Cycle Ride.“But around that time I picked up a hip injury which ended up requiring surgery,” he said.That obviously put paid to his London to Paris ideas.This year Austin contacted the organisers to see when, or , there would be another such event.With Coivid- wiping out virtually everything he was not sure what answer to expect. But he was delighted to be steered on to the Diabetes UK’s Cycle for September. Austin signed up for the  miles - and had the full month of September to pedal this distance, and collect sponsorship for Diabetes UK along the way.The Digital Sales and Marketing man at Algram in Railway Street, Ballymena, was more than busy at work and admitted finding it tough to get the time to cycle.Eighteen years ago he was diagnosed with Type  diabetes.“This obviously was a big change not just for me but for my family and those around me too,” outlined Austin. “I’ve always been into sport whether it’s football, rugby, golf or cycling and I felt that cycling  miles throughout the month of September was a great way for me to raise money for Diabetes UK and give a little back.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1602771523139.jpg--mayor_praises_schoolboys_for_their_heroic_actions.jpg?1602771532000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20201015newsmayor praises schoolboys for their heroic actions","story":"THE Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has formally honoured four teenagers who rescued a father and his two children from the sea at White Park Bay earlier this year.

The claim is a positive given that the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, the pharmaceutical company said.A company spokesman said: It#s encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity [vaccine reaction] was lower in older adults, where the Covid- disease severity is higher.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHealth Secretary Matt Hancock FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHealth Secretary Matt HancockHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday it is his central expectation that the majority of the roll-out of a vaccine could be under way in the first half of , stressing the bulk of the programme could happen before next summer.When asked about reports that hospitals are preparing to vaccinate staff, Mr Hancock told the BBC that it#s not my central expectation that we#ll be doing that this year. He added: We don#t know when the first vaccine will be available but my central expectation is in the first half of next year.A Department of Health spokesperson here said the Government has secured access to six potential Covid- candidates.This reflects the UK#s strategy to ensure we have a supply of vaccines should any of these prove safe and effective, they said. The vaccines are currently at ious stages of the human trials that they must complete before they can be considered for use in a vaccination programme.The best case scenario is that we will have a vaccine in use before the end of the year and we are currently planning on that basis, however, realistically it may be next year before sufficient doses are available to vaccinate on a large scale.Professor Ultan Power, Professor of Molecular Virology at Queen#s University, warned it is very dficult to estimate when a vaccine will be made available.He said regardless of any estimated roll-out, it is crucial that the third trial of any vaccine candidate meets all safety requirements. A lot depends on the safety profile of phase three. If it is successful and safe, and its efficacy is assured then there should be no problem, he said.Professor Power also emphasised the roll-out of a vaccine will depend on an effective manufacturing process. Another factor, he argued, is the willingness of the public to have the vaccine.

These issues, compounded by the ongoing health pandemic, has resulted in immense strain being placed on the service. I raised the concerns of the Ambulance Service directly with the Health Minister. Giving the worrying figures noted by the Health Minister of the limited capacity of Rapid Response Vehicles and ambulances during recent months, it is crucially important that the Minister urgently intervenes to provide maximum support to NIAS and ensures that the service is properly resourced.NIAS warned in July that it was facing increased challenges in maintaining planned levels of cover across all of its isions in Northern Ireland, meaning that response times to some calls would be delayed.It outlined a range of reasons for the drop in staff cover and delayed response times.This included increased use of NIAS services over recent years without an increase in staffing levels, % of frontline staff being absent due to ordinary sickness or reasons related to Covid-, annual leave commitments, assaults on staff and similar issues facing Trust staff.NIAS chief executive Michael Bloomfield has appealed for support from politicians to ensure that ambulances remain available to respond to le-threatening emergencies.

In some respects it#s sad to see that so many families need the help, but it#s also so heartening to watch people come off the streets with cash donations and bags of shopping as they just want to help out.We#re across the road from the Royal Victoria Hospital and we#ve had a lot of staff just drop off bags of groceries to help, she said. Irwins bakery asked us how many loaves we wanted. There are so many people who just want to do the right thing and I know there are many, many families out there who are so grateful for the help.This isn#t just about finance, she said. This is about providing nutritional meals for children and as long as we#re needed we#ll keep on doing it.Pauline said the publicity given to the crisis by the England footballer has been extraordinary.He noticed what we were doing and gave us a thumbs up. We never expected that and we certainly never expected the community spirit that has been flowing ever since, she said.And it#s great to see so many other cafes around Belfast now getting involved.One of those taking up the initiative and providing free lunches for school children is Victoria Armstrong at The Lamppost Cafe on the Newtownards Road.While we do know Stormont has made provision to continue the school meals voucher scheme, there are always some who are in danger of slipping trough the cracks, she said.We made the decision over the weekend that we had to try to do what we could. We#ve seen the impact it#s had on communities in England and wanted to try to give a little bit back.There are a lot of families who are struggling, the purse strings are tighter and the kids are now off school for an extended period of time. This isn#t just about providing a free lunch for kids who need it, it#s about reaching out to the community in general.We#re in a fortunate position to be able to do this andwe can help even a little bit it#s worth doing.We#ve always tried to work with charities and this is just an extension of that.We#ve been delighted with the response.It#s been a busy day, but a lot of people thought we#d just be doing this for today. That#s not the plan. We want to carry this on all week. We#ll just keep trying to help in any way we can.The community spirit is rising to the top around the country as well.In Co Armagh the staff at one local estate agency have been using their local knowledge to hit the road with deliveries of food and groceries around the area.Employees at Hannath, based in Portadown, teamed up with non-profit Covid support group Cafe Abundance to spend the weekend delivering around the Craigavon area.It was great to be involved, said managing director Alastair Glass. We always try to be as involved as possible with the local community and we#ve seen a real need for support on the doorstep.There#s a fair bit of fear out there this time, both in families and in businesses. We were happy to help and it#s great to see the community come together.Belfast Most ReadVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases reported as hospitals struggle with second Covid- waveFather and his two sons die in shooting at Co Cork farm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Mr Donald said he had fond memories of his childhood - when there were several in close proximity, including The Cannon Film Centre and The New Vic on Great Victoria Street on either side of the junction with Grosvenor Road.“I think what the city centre does lack, and has for a very long time, is cinemas in the city centre - when you think of how many there used to be.”While there is still an Odeon Cinema in Victoria Square, he said there was scope for more - especially following the closure earlier this year of the Movie House on Dublin Road, which had been due for demoltion so that offices could be built on site.“Going to the cinema gives you a reason for going into town. Someone might meet in a pub or go for their tea first, or come out of the pictures and go for a pint or a bite to eat, but one feeds off the other thought the cinema is the reason they come in the first place.”He said he hoped that his venues could reopen at the end of the four weeks of retrictions. “I don’t want to get to . weeks to be told we can’t reopen.”Restaurateur Michael Deane has seven restaurants in Belfast - the majority in the city centre close to Donegall Square.All have been shut since the start of the new period of restrictions on October .”We’re trying to do the carry-out bit which we did during the first lockdown but I think people are nearly in a second wave of shock that this has happened again, so that trade is a bit down. There’s a bit of an air of depression in the city centre.”In the long-term, he said the city centre needed to embrace a culture of eating and drinking outside.“We’ve been very hard on the city centre regarding licensing, outside seating and drinking outside - the way you might see someone in Rome, sitting outside drinking coffee in a fur coat and glasses. I don’t think we’ve ever brought that in successfully.”He said he has now added an eletric outdoor room to his Queen’s Quarter restaurant Deanes at Queen’s. But he said Donegall Square could have potential to become an elegant piazza. “Ok, Belfast is not Barcelona or Rome but it has some beautul buildings.“So let’s get all the banks, all the buses, out of Donegall Square. It could be beautul, all around there. Let’s get culture into that area, wine bars and plenty of le. City Hall is one of our most iconic buildings so let’s make more use of it.“Get it all pedestrianised around there. The continental market hasn’t done much harm but it hasn’t done much good. Let’s leave it for five years and let it come back better. To my mind, it became a beer-tent culture with hotdogs so it wasn’t really a market at all.”He added: “Hospitality is really on its knees but I really hope we can get back to some kind of normality.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Lewis- PhotopressBelfast --Grass is being laid in High Street near the Castle Junction Primark cordon in preparation for the installation of a carousel and an ice rink.It is all part of the City Council initiative to bring footfall back to the city centre following the dramatic fall in shoppers visiting the area in the aftermath of the devastating fire that gutted the historic Primark Bank Buildings store.The traditional Christmas Market will also be extended this year to take in a part of Donegal Place in the run-up to Christmas.Today a new package of measures were announced aimed at rejuvenating the city centre.The following statement accompanied the announcement of the new financial package that is in addition to that already announced.The efforts to bring shoppers and visitors back into Belfast city centre in the wake of the Bank Buildings fire will be supported by a further £.million from Northern Ireland departments, the Head of the Civil Service announced today.The funding follows Belfast City Councilís announcement in October, which detailed a £.million contribution, the £million announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond and £, given by Primark to provide support to traders.The latest contribution from the Northern Ireland Civil Service brings the overall recovery package to nearly £million.David Sterling, Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, said: ìSince the devastating fire at Bank Buildings, the civil service has been working closely with Belfast City Council to support affected traders in the run up to Christmas.ìThis will help address some of the dficulties shoppers and visitors have faced as they try and move around the city centre.

When it’s over and a vaccine is through, it’s still beautul to sit outside in areas with fake grass.”He said lessons from the use of outdoor space following the fire at Primark in August  could be adapted.“There are another three businesses around us - Voodoo, Jumon and Fountain Tavern - and we could all joint together in a covered outdoor area with heaters, and really make the most of the whole street.”And he said he was not a fan of the continental market, which usually pitches outside City Hall in the run-up to Christmas. “They bring in people from everywhere to sell their buffalo burger made of pig’s toe, or whatever, and it’s all total and utter rubbish. “I’m not a fan and we see as % drop from very day it’s opened.”His venue, which he co-owns with Arthur McAnerney, only managed to reopen in December last year after it had been closed for more than a year after the Primark fire. “We’re now preparing some new product ideas - a new taco and smoke meat offering - for the future which might make us a little bit more robust in this kind of climate.“But it’s all about trying to be entrepreneurial. We applied for an outside licence at the start of June and we’v had no reply from City Council. Was sort of spirt does that show ”A spokeswoman for Belfast City Council said it had received a revised application by City Picnic for a pavement cafe licence at the end of last month. The application has been sent to PSNI and Roads, within the Department for Infrstructure. “The application requires DfI Roads to formally close a portion of Fountain Street at the junction with Castle Street. Belfast City Council will proceed with its assessment on receipt of a response from DfI Roads.”She said  applications for pavement cafe licences had been received though seven were rejected as they were on public land. “Belfast City Council officers are currently working with both applicants and statutory bodies to process the remaining  applications.”Chris Suitor, the co-owner of menswear specialist Suitor Bros on Upper Arthur Street, said parking was one of the worst problems for the city centre, particularly for his shop’s older clientele.“You can’t even stop in the loading bay outside our shop for five minutes without a traffic warden coming and giving you serious hassle. It’s so off-putting, it’s terrible.” He said he would also be in favour of pedestrianisation of streets around City Hall.And he said a parking strategy should also be developed. “Why not offer shoppers cheaper parking for perhaps a few hours a day  If you offer cheaper parking all day, there’s the potential for office workers to use up spaces - butyou just have it for a few hours, that could really get shoppers in.”Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said the Chamber’s Build Belfast Back Better paper in June had said the short-term focus should be on making sure it’s a clean and safe city to visit.“That would include not just things like hand sanitising stations across the city centre but also more of the parklets we’ve seen on the Ormeau Road to support more outdoor dining which we believe can safely happen. “In the longer term, we believe that we need to inject more resilience and robustness into the city by increasing the residential population in central Belfast.“It is something that is sorely lacking from our city centre compared to other similar cities and is not just a more sustainable way to grow our population but can also help sustain our retail and hospitality sectors in the longer term.”Kathleen McBride, managing director of Belfast One Business Improvement District, which represents around  businesses from across the retail, hospitality and professional services sectors, said that the organisation was currently consulting with businesses to hear what was most important to them for the next five years.She said: “Feedback from traders is that seasonal events like Restaurant Week, Christmas activities, Summer Cinema and Fashion Week made a real dference to their businesses in the past few years and we will do more activity like that to support them when the time is right.“We are encouraging safe shopping in the city centre this Christmas and have planned a range of family activities which can be carried out by social distancing as well as launching a gt card to support our traders.“The city centre has experienced unprecedented challenges this year but we have also seen businesses demonstrate that they are innovative and resilient.“Our Business Plan from  to  will reflect the needs of our businesses for the medium to long term and we are encouraging them to have their say.”  Belfast   Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumexclusiveCoronavirus: Nearly half of Belfast city traders have let staff goNearly half of Belfast city centre employers have already had to let staff go as a result of the economic hit of Covid-, according to a survey by Belfast Chamber today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-dd-fb-c-fef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-dd-fb-c-fef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-dd-fb-c-fef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-dd-fb-c-fef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-dd-fb-c-fef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandBusinesses challenging ‘disproportionate’ shutdown of beauty industryA group representing close contact workers will set out a case in court against the “disproportionate” and “arbitrary” shutdown of their businesses.Most ReadVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases reported as hospitals struggle with second Covid- waveFather and his two sons die in shooting at Co Cork farm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Brexit vote had just happened and Theresa May had just become Prime Minister.At Good Morning Britain, we weren#t quite down the mines, but -hour overnight marathon shts eight or nine times a month were starting to take their toll after two fascinating years on the programme.Little did I know as my email made its way to Number  supremo Fiona Hill that just weeks later I would be starting an exciting new le as special adviser to Secretary of State James Brokenshire.When he very sadly had to resign due to lung cancer  months later, I worked very briefly for his successor, Karen Bradley, even more briefly for Home Secretary Amber Rudd and then, having recovered from cancer, James came back into the Cabinet as Housing Secretary and asked me to serve alongside him again at his new department.I spent nearly three years in total working for James before he was sacked when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, after which I was transferred to the Ministry of Justice to work for the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland.But in July , the entirety of this crazy, draining and incredibly interesting le was all ahead of me.Emailing Fiona, I had absolutely nothing to lose - except those dreaded, draining night shts on Good Morning Britain.I had always loved politics, leaping at the chance to do the subject at A-level under an inspiring teacher at Portadown College, Sean Dunlop. Later, when I was Spad at the Ministry of Justice, I had a group of Sean#s students into the Lord Chancellor#s office when they were over in London on a school trip. I#m afraid I breached protocol by allowing my former teacher to try on the Lord Chancellor#s wig, much to the amusement of his students and colleagues. Sean was game for a laugh as always, smiling happily as the students snapped away on their phones.I#d watched the news almost from infancy, and indeed remember aged five writing to - and receiving a reply from - UTV#s Paul Clark.But  years into my career, having known, met and sometimes become friends with Spads, I had done most of what I wanted to do in journalism. I had written suggested questions for Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight as my first proper job, worked for the BBC in Washington, New York, Belfast and London, been senior producer on Question Time aged  and been a reporter for five years too, on both radio and telly, reporting from Downing Street and the White House.Having interviewed everyone from Cate Blanchett to Timmy Mallett, I fancied a change.TV reporting especially is a ruthless game - your face either fits or it does not.Sometimes in my career it did, sometimes it did not, and that could change with the wind - as I and others painfully learned, it was not always the survival of the fittest.It was just  hours after my initial email that a reply came from Fiona Hill informing me, rather directly, that: James Brokenshire is about to ring you. James had been appointed Northern Ireland Secretary about  days previously, but I didn#t know him from Adam, and he, similarly, couldn#t have picked me out of a police line-up.Mildly panicking that I was about to be rung by a Cabinet minister, we actually missed each other#s calls, eventually speaking briefly and arranging to meet two days later in the plush surroundings of the five-star Corinthia Hotel in Westminster.Remarkably, it was just a week between our gin and tonic at the Corinthia Hotel and my confirmation as special adviser to the Secretary of State.As I was to learn, Spads in Westminster play a weird daily role to their ministers, somewhere between friend, gatekeeper, adviser and general dogsbody. As his media Spad, I was to advise James both on what to say in the crucial .am interview on the Today programme as well as reminding him to have a pee beforehand.As part of what I dubbed #The Brokenshire Travelling Circus# we generally operated a #where James goes I go# rule, the frequency of travel between Belfast and London one of the things that struck me the most when I first started the job at the NIO.But of course the travel is entirely necessary for the Northern Ireland Secretary to do the job. In  I took  flights for work, mostly between London and Belfast, but occasionally we travelled to Dublin and Brussels too, as we had many meetings with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and EU figures such as Michel Barnier about Brexit.It wasn#t the best carbon footprint, but the upsides were that the very nice flight attendants on Aer Lingus knew how I liked my teaand I can still recite the Aer Lingus and British Airways safety instruction presentation by heart. Indeed, one Aer Lingus flight attendant, a lovely woman called Louise Annon, even became my Facebook friend.The Northern Ireland Secretary also comes with a few friends - his or her police protection officers, who are with them  , whether out and about, in the office or staying at home or Hillsborough Castle, where James and I often stayed overnight in the beautul flats.Sadly, you are not allowed to sleep in the Queen#s bed any more, as I was told former Chancellor George Osborne once did.James#s protection officers got on well with him, but the   nature really is exactly that. So when the officers accompanied the family one afternoon on a trip to Chessington World of Adventures for one of the Brokenshire children#s birthdays, the following Monday, James joked that his officers were too scared to go on the rollercoasters - an experience each of them had, sadly, declined. The officers often dwarfed James, who is ft ins tall and mockingly refers to himself as #The Hobbit from the Broken-shire#. With this in mind, the Monday morning after the family theme park visit, I asked the assembled officers: So, was James tall enough for the rides then Le at the Northern Ireland Office wasn#t always a laughing matter, of course, and the collapse of Stormont in January  necessitated a lot more time in intensive talks with figures such as Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams - the terrorist bogeymen of my youth - and Arlene Foster, all of whom I had interviewed as a journalist. But of course it is very dferent to be across the table from these people helping to negotiate than shoving a UTV or BBC Northern Ireland microphone in their face.The scheduling of the election in  unhelpfully stalled these talks, but working on the Conservative Party#s campaign set the stage for one of the most special days I had working with James.That was May , , when I accompanied James to the Balmoral Show for a campaign visit alongside then Prime Minister Theresa May. James and Mrs May were mobbed as they walked through the tented stands on the gloriously sunny day, sampling the fine fare and chatting with stallholders. Arlene Foster was also there, and heard the PM was also attending that day and came up to say hello.

But the interviews were word-perfect and we breathed a sigh of relief afterwards.I was used to travelling with James and his protection officers, but with the Prime Minister it is a more elaborate affair. There is a long convoy of numerous vehicles, what the Americans call a motorcade. The Northern Ireland visit was the first time I had travelled with police motorcycle outriders and their flashing blue lights, and it really was quite cool as they sped alongside us. The Prime Minister was only in Northern Ireland for a few hours, but I will remember that bright, brilliant day for a letime.The Secret Le of Special Advisers, by Peter Cardwell, is published by Biteback tomorrow  Belfast   Most ReadVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases reported as hospitals struggle with second Covid- waveFather and his two sons die in shooting at Co Cork farm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Micheal Martin and the Irish Government are worryingly out of touch with the aspirations of the people of this island. The Irish Government cannot stand idly by. They must lead the preparations for a new, united Ireland.The LucidTalk poll indicated that the NHS would play a key role in deciding a border poll with % of people definitely voting for Irish unity, % for the Union - but % saying they#d likely opt to remain in the UK because of the NHS.UUP leader Steve Aiken said: The NHS is quite rightly the source of great national pride within the UK and is the envy of many countries. Its central role has never been more evident than during the Covid pandemic.It is perfectly understandable that, in any consideration of the merits of the Union, voters of all persuasions would be extremely reluctant to give up the NHS and exchange it for the system that is in place in the Republic of Ireland.DUP MP Carla Lockhart said the poll confirmed the importance of our UK national institutions like the NHS but said the health service should be strengthened, not at the centre of a isive border poll campaign.Northern Ireland benefits hugely from being part of the UK and we have seen that clearly demonstrated through the response to the Covid- pandemic. Those who want to remove Northern Ireland from the NHS put their party politics above the wellbeing of the public, she said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the poll indicated that health was a key consideration when considering constitutional change. That#s why the SDLP is undertaking the hard work of exploring what public services in a new Ireland would look like, he said. It is a myth that uniting this island means the wholesale privatisation of one of our greatest assets. Our challenge is to conceive a new way of doing things that takes the best of both systems and delivers better health outcomes for our people.A TUV spokesman said: Far from the pandemic quickening the drive for Irish unity, it has underscored the fact that we are better off as part of the UK with even the most republican areas applauding the NHS.The poll results underscore that, when it comes down to it, the people of Northern Ireland would be too canny to vote for a united Ireland.Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said his party#s immediate focus was on Covid and Brexit but we do nevertheless recognise we are in a fluid situation with multiple conversations around the future of these islands.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumexclusivePoll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckThe NHS will play a major role in deciding a border poll with support for the Union and a united Ireland neck-and-neck, according to a new survey.Northern IrelandUnionists are unfazed by Taoiseach Micheal Martin#s stance on a united IrelandThe Taoiseach#s toughened stance on a united Ireland after he said a border poll was not on his current agenda shouldn#t prevent friendly British-Irish relations, unionists have said.Most ReadVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases reported as hospitals struggle with second Covid- waveFather and his two sons die in shooting at Co Cork farm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Neil McCafferty has underlying health conditions including a heart problem and diabetes and is therefore in several at-risk categories. Upon entering the hospital the -year-old was Covid negative but has now contracted the virus. Mr McCafferty is a father of five to son Michael and four daughters, Andrea, Karen, Sinead and Emma. When added to his other health conditions his family believe it will take a ‘miracle’ for him to survive. googletag.cmd.push Since the start of the pandemic, the now retired man has adhered to all the rules by shielding and when society reopened took every precaution, deciding to spend most of his time at home. The heartbroken family say that he was the one they were trying to protect throughout. His son Michael said: “Ma dad is not good, all we can do is hope, but there’s not much hope there.” Mr McCafferty’s his we Bridieadded: “Put it this way, it would take a big, big miracle for my husband to survive this.”  They made it clear that this is ‘not criticism of the NHS’ but a means of highlighting complacency in the community and government failures. googletag.cmd.push Michael explained: “This is about awareness of wearing masks, about social distancing, about trying to keep people out of hospital who don’t need to be there. “This is about a liaison officer being at the hospital to inform families about their loved one’s condition during this dficult time when you can’t be there to hold their hand. “And it’s about people not having house parties or gatherings.” COMMUNICATION Lack of communication meant the family were unaware that their husband and father was on dialysis as the infection was ‘attacking his kidneys’. The next day they discovered that he had developed sepsis which is a potentially le-threatening condition caused by the bodys response to an infection.     His son raised concerns that while dropping off medication for his fathers diabetes some hospital staff were not wearing masks. They believe that with the rise in local cases extra precautions should be taken in Derry, especially inside the hospital. “Retail and hospitality staff who aren’t in direct contact with you have to wear a mask. “But when I went into a hospital these people weren’t wearing masks, it doesn’t make sense,” Michael said. On Monday morning they found out that their dad had ‘taken a turn’ during the night and had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit . A consultant assured the family that negative Covid tests had been ed twice but the infection was ‘really bad’. He was ventilated for fluid in the lungs, kidneys being worked on through dialysis and they were trying to give him strong antibiotics to fight the infection. They tried phoning for hours to get an update when at .pm on October  they were informed that he had contracted Covid. Now, more than ever, when people cant visit sick friends or relatives they believe that better communication is needed from the Trust to provide updates on their condition and peace of mind. Bridie commented: “There has been a lack of communication. My husband couldn’t communicate to me because he wasn’t very lucid, he was telling me that he got his kidney drained and a young nurse or receptionist told me that no it was his gall bladder. “No doctor phoned me to tell me that he had sepsis, no doctor phoned me to tell me that he was getting dialysis, no doctor phoned me until last night to tell me that he had Covid but we had to chase it up. “If I was allowed, I’m not saying we should be, butI seen my husband and the way he was deteriorating I could demand to see a doctor. “But it’s lack of communication, there should be some type of family liaison to let you know what is going on.” She continued: “I understand that doctors and nurses sign up to take care of people, they don’t sign up to go into work and take their own lives in their hands. “At the very start, hotels were open to hospital staff, BBs were open to them, they were all shielding but now that’s not happening when it’s re. I just don’t understand it.” After the Derry News contacted the Trust about the family’s concerns they did receive a positive call from a nurse who provided a comprehensive update. ‘PERFECT FATHER’  The family collectively understand the exceptional times we’re living in but believe there is still room for a compassionate approach. Michael said: “These are dficult times but it takes the humanity away from it when in normal circumstances,this is his last few days of le, we could be there holding his hand. “I went back to leave a phone charger for him and asked could I go in to see him and was told ‘no, you’re not allowed’, and that’s the last time I’ll probably see him.” Her voice shaking with emotion, Bridie paid tribute to her husband: “People always think their parents are the best in the world, but I’m telling you now, they have a perfect father. “He would do anything for them.” In tears his daughters explained that their father was the kindest man who cared for people. Recently he did everything in his power to help -year-old Derry man, Blian Bowe, who was in an induced coma because of Coronavirus. Mr McCafferty’s daughter Emma said: “We do not want any other family to go through this. “He shielded all during lockdown and when it was lted he wore a mask and wasn’t going out to places he shouldn’t have been. “But he has gone in there and contracted Covid, with the underlying issues he might not have got out but this has just put a tonne of bricks on top of his other issues. “We want people to take responsibility. It’s not about contracting it. Somebody could go into the hospital with a sore toe and not come out. “There are a lot of staff off shielding too, this is not an attack on the NHS or a personal attack on any nurses, it’s about people understanding the seriousness of this now and making the right decisions about whether or not to go to hospital. “Andthey do, they have to take extra care.” Michael concluded: “This is directed at the government. We need another full lockdown, we need what I call a time-stop. “Send everybody home, stop mortgages and so on and give people a small subsidy for food. “This is not the Spanish flu this is worse, because people will not abide by the rules and respect what it is. “The government is trying to look after the economy. To put everybody in their homes again will damage the economy, but to put everyone out to work will damage it even more because it will put enormous pressure on the NHS and thousands of people will be off work sick.”  TRUST RESPONSE The Trust was asked to respond to the families concerns. In particular, given that visiting was suspended during the first wave of the virus, whether the Trust had used the time in between to establish a communication channel for families to ensure they have updates. Due to the ‘overwhelming number of media queries’ the Trust is receiving at present, a spokesperson said it was unable to provide a direct response. However, it did point out that visiting was suspended from October  until further notice. The Trust acknowledged that it is a ‘dficult time’ for the public and said that ‘virtual visits’ can be arranged. Visiting will only be permitted under very special circumstances at Altnagelvin Hospital including in paediatrics, maternity, palliative care and dementia  learning disability. “Our priority is to safeguard and protect people who are receiving care and also to protect our staff. “If you are permitted to visit under special circumstances you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting Altnagelvin Hospital,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Photographs have appeared online which indicate that oil or diesel has spilled from the boat into the river. As an Independent Statutory Authority Foyle Port has a duty to develop, maintain and operate to the highest standards of efficiency, financial prudence, environmental awareness, safety and security. A spokesperson for Foyle Port today said: “The responsibility of the ongoing management of the boat lies with the owner and it is in everyone’s interest that he takes the appropriate action for its movement. googletag.cmd.push “We are in contact with the owner and await the next steps in his decision making in terms of his plan to move the vessel.” He added: “It is unfortunate that we have had to take some preventative action already in terms of placing a boom around the boat. “We are monitoring the situation and made it clear to the owner that this needs to come to a conclusion sooner rather than later.” A boom is a floating beam used to contain oil spills - they are used to reduce the possibility of polluting shorelines and other resources, and to help make recovery easier. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News first reported on Day Dawn N  running ashore on August . Last week, for the first time publicly, the owners Nathan Ross andDruso Martinez de Riquelme gave their side of the story. They confirmed that their intentions are to travel to Belfast once a starter motor is installed where the old fishing trawler will be moored at the Titanic Quarter as an Air B ‘n’ B. One of the owners Druso Martinez de Riquelme said they got the boat for free and have since invested thousands of pounds in it. The owners remain determined to refloat the vessel when the tide is favourable.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He tells Michael McMullan of the decision, the ups, the downs the memories along the way. Four days after this years county hurling final, Liam Hinphey took a moment to post a brief, yet the most poignant of tweets. Fteen words. Four photos. Three jersies. Red, black and white hearts. The colours he soldiered in. The former Dungiven and Derry footballer, was putting away his hurl. “Father time is undefeated,” it began. A career that juggled big and wee ball, across school, college, club and county had run its course.  googletag.cmd.push “You know when the time is right and you have dferent priorities,” he stated early in our interview. His we Clare had given up work to be their son Liams full-time carer. The three year-old lives with Dravet Syndrome, a drug-resistant form of epilepsy that leads to seizures and visits to hospital. “He just needs full time care and we decided Clare was the best person to do it,” Liam adds. Their daughter Cara is now in P. On the Wednesday after the final, her and Daddy went for a walk. “It was a nice evening and it wouldve been one of our training nights. Me and her went for a walk and I thought this is great to get spending a bit of time with her. googletag.cmd.push “If it was mid-season, I wouldve been at training and Clare wouldve had the two weans.” An interview to recollect his playing career, meant hed have to go through with retirement. A warrior on the pitch, every word coming down the phone was calculated and softly spoken. In the epicentre of his dual county career, a successful battle with a groin injury forced him to pick one code. With the time needed to compete, he looked into his soul. It was the wee ball that plucked harder at his emotions. Years later, as the weeks ticked towards the  club season and with a winter of rehabbing another groin injury, he veered towards another sporting crossroads.      His sons seizures had begun. Family called. Mixing both sports wasnt going to be feasible. “I cant play any more,” he reluctantly told the football management. “It wasnt like I didnt want to, I just didnt have time. Work and home le was getting fairly hectic. I wouldve needed to have manufactured another couple of days in the week,” said Hinphey, who played senior championship football for Dungiven since he stepped out of minor until the age of  or . “In that time, I played county hurling and football, I was travelling up and down to Belfast four or five nights a week...it was tight going.”  By the time that years hurling championship came around, he missed the semi-final with Slaughtneil, a game they lost by a point. As the Derry hurling heavyweights were prodding one another in an epic at Ballinascreen, Liam and Clare were in hospital as their son took a bad seizure. “That was the first big game that I couldnt play in,” Liam said.  The nature of the defeat made it dficult to walk away. They were close. But how could he keep up the level of preparation,his sons condition needed more care  “Is it worth it, to put a full year into it,” Liam asked himself. “Championship is what you play for.” He asked again. “Is it worth another nine months of hard work to potentially not play again ” He decided to give it one last big push for the  season and was pleasantly surprised when new Derry manager John McEvoy rang him. Collie McGurk had coaxed him back out to play in the semi-final of the Christy Ring against Kildare the year before and Derry wasnt on the radar under the new boss. “I wasnt expecting John to ask me, but he did. I thought,it is going to be my last year I might as well play for the county .” Derry lost in the Christy Ring semi-final to Meath, again to the eventual winners before embarking on what he still felt was his last season of club action. “My attitude before itwas, just to give this everything. Win or lose, thats me,” Liam said.Shortly after the final, Geoffrey McGonigle asked him to meet him for a pint. Knowing Geoffrey was staying on as manager, Liam knew the gist of what was to follow. “The first words he said was  youre not playing hurling next year, Im gonna bust your face,” Hinphey laughs. “We got chatting and I said wed give it a go and see how it plays out.” His sons cluster of seizures and with Covid bringing a greater risk, Liam didnt lt a hurl until just before the semi-final win over Ballinascreen.  The lack of time to prepare made up his mind. “I know myself that I was far from my best,” he conceded, admitting that his general fitness wasnt the problem. “This year, I was trying to play with very little training behind me. Unfortunately, the way things are, I cant commit the time and effort to stay in the shape I need to be at the level I would want to play at.” Trying to topple Slaughtneil would have to be the target. He compares their professionalism to a county team. “Id love to be selfish enough to do it, to train every day...be it recovery, a gym session, swimming or just training.” Hed love the challenge, but father time didnt agree. It was time to move on. *** Along with his brothers Kieran and Kevin, Liam spent hours of their youth hurling in the garden. All-Irelands from the telly were re-enacted, with the odd flood of tears and the smash of a window pane. Their mother is Mary K Brolly, sister of the late Francie. Their sister Emer began playing camogie again in her thirties, for Bredagh in Belfast, where she won an intermediate title. Like her brother Kevin has with the Lynchs, she has followed father Liam seniors footsteps into coaching. Even though his Da was a big hurling man, Liam doesnt ever remember being forced into the game. “Da went to Croke Park for every Kilkenny game and he used to bring us since we were no height. I mustve been to Croke Park  times before I was  years of age,” he said.  Along with a group of friends, from the age of , they would spend their summers up at the Gaelic pitch, from morning to night. In between, it was just wall to wall football and hurling. His age group didnt win anything as they moved up the ranks, but playing above himself on Kevins team bore fruit. “That was a strong team. The only thing we didnt win was the U Feacuteile final,” remembers Liam, who won one of his U medals as a goalkeeper. Two minor titles followed and after losing to Ballygalget in the Ulster final in Ballinascreen, they went on better the following year to see off St Galls in the decider. “The success we had at senior level was a combination of those boys coming through. We joined in with Barry Kelly, Emmet McKeever, James Donaghy , Geoffrey, Ronie , Eddie Friel...that group. It was a really good combination of youth and experience,” Liam pointed out. It yielded seven senior championships, including one as captain in , with the last coming in . Along with Dungivens football final defeat to Loup in , Liams other disappointment was their Ulster hurling final defeat two years earlier to Dunloy. With time up, they trailed - to -, but a Paul Shiels goal saw the Antrim champions punish the Lynchs with a late - burst at Casement Park. Liam refers to their missed goal chances, but like all the defeats he takes them in his stride – mentioning them without dwelling too much. Niall Mullan handed him his senior championship debut in a  defeat by Slaughtneil in Drum, in the week of his th birthday.  “I was marking Dermot Doherty,” Hinphey recalls. “ I remember the terrible weather, it pished all night.” He had just turned  and remembers taking a drink that night for the first time. “Before that, I just didnt bother. It wasnt anything overly religious. It was the time when boys were sneaking cans, I was more afraid of Ma and Da.” Kevin Lynchs would win six of the next seven championships and, over his career, the  defeat to Banagher was one of a few he felt got away from them. “We had a goal disallowed and a few things. Its not something I sit up worrying about. I am happy enough with my lot. “There was one against Slaughtneil . They scored two goals in the last five minutes. We sort of controlled that game.” The words between Hinpheys recollections are consistent. His career was a good one, blessed with talented teams with craic and friendships along the way. It has been nine years since they won the Fr Collins Cup, but Hinphey didnt see that spell as a slog with any fall outs. “We have had good management and good setups,” he stressed. “The players put it in. They are great lads, you had  to  training every night and putting it in. Its a pity we werent more successful.” There is also the camaraderie. Niall Mullan gave him his debut and he played alongside his son Darragh. He was managed by John A Mullan and played on the same team as his sons John and Richie. “There are zero boys Ive played with, thatyou were sitting in a bar in a few years time, you wouldnt be able to have a few pints with him. It is something to be thankful for. “I am lucky enough from that point of view, to have the characters we had around the place. Thats one of the good things to take away from it.” He doesnt believe in drink bans. Teams who are driven, will find their way to balance the work and the social aspect. In his opinion, you need both. After finals it was about getting back to the town and being in each others company. First it was into McReynolds, before heading down to the Arcade. Liam felt the  final defeat to Slaughtneil was one that got away “In the earlier days wed have ended up in the Carraig Rua. Later on, it was the Tavern or Donegal Charlies,” said Hinphey, who always appreciated the Monday. “You get in early and it is the first chance the team gets to sit and have the craic together. Those days were always the best.” In recent years, without the Fr Collins Cup to show for their efforts, it was still important to unite. “You have put a lot of time into it...hours and hours,. You have to... not celebrate that you are beat, but put an exclamation mark at the end season and have a few drinks with boys to finish it out...otherwise what is the point ” Liams first taste of senior county hurling came in the  season, while still at school. After St Patricks Magheras Hogan Cup run, he didnt feature in Dominic McKinleys Ulster championship plans, but started at wing forward in an All-Ireland preliminary round two-point defeat to Kerry in Tullamore, marking his debut with a point. “I loved my times playing with Derry hurling and ultimately, thats why I didnt go back to thefootball,” Liam admits.Pulling his body between both codes told him to choose. He went for his favourite. “I would rather be playing the hurling and try to push the Derry hurling on a bit. That was the decision I made and I dont regret it one minute. “We had brilliant days, there was not as much silverware as we shouldve won, but there were some brilliant years,” he added. He has two Nicky Rackard Cup medals, but the Christy Ring Cup eluded him. The semi-final defeats of  to Kildare and the following year to Meath, his last game with the county, were as close he got. With both going on to win the final easily. “We got the final onceand it was the year we were further away. That Kerry team was very strong,” he adds. “That was always the ambition of ours. We were always good enough, but we didnt. There is nothing I sitand think we shouldve won.” Like with the club, he points to the Derry men he hurled with, who will be friends for le. “The friendships I have made over the years are more important than that sort of stuff. Big Ruairi , Breandan Quigley and Paddy Henry...all them boys.”  The WhatsApp group is an active one. “They are the friends I have and thats not to be scoffed at either. It is an important thing and I am very thankful for.” *** By his own admission, Liam Hinphey was far from being the best footballer on Dungiven underage teams. At St Patricks Maghera, he didnt play on any of the school teams after second or third year. And there werent any teachers coming knocking on the door to coax him. At the start of Upper Sixth, a requirement to pick an activity for the Wednesday afternoon sport slot and the prompt of a class mate helped him make the first step on the road to a senior inter-county football career. “It was Joe Keenan,” Hinphey begins. “He talked me into going to these Gaelic matches. I went down, started to play well.” After playing a few games for the B team in the ODoherty, Dermot McNicholl liked what he saw. “I started all thegroup games, I played half-back and ended up being moved into midfield. I ended up having to mark the main men on the other teams. I wasnt a great footballer, but I was good at stopping great footballers.” Maghera beat rivals St Marys Magherafelt in the final. In the Hogan Cup semi-final against Colaacuteiste Na Sceilge, he was asked to mark Kerrys Bryan Sheehan and James Kavanagh in the final against St Jarlaths Tuam. “Winning the Hogan Cup was brilliant,” Hinphey said. “It is a dferent build up and dferent sort of camaraderie. You are spending more time with those boys than you are with your own families, because you are at school with them for eight hours a day.” That campaign made him as a footballer and by Wednesday, Dermot McNicholl, who was also Dungivens senior manager, fired him in at centre back against Slaughtneil. That was the beginning. “The thought of playing senior wouldve been fancul”, he said of his ambitions at underage. “In terms of my football development, it wouldnt have played senior football for Dungiven or Derry without that .  Liam in football action for Dungiven  “When I was younger, I was never the paciest. Then I started to mature a bit at  or . I got a lot faster, so from half back I was able to burst forward. Before that, I was jogging about at one pace.” Paddy Crozier took over as Dungiven boss and later called Hinphey up when he became the Derry senior manager at the start of the  season. “I didnt feel out of my depth when I did go up,” he said. After wonderinghe could play at the level, the lure of Division  and pitting himself against some of the best about convinced Hinphey to answer Paddys call. “I started most of that year,” Liam recalls. He spoke of the night Oisin McConville, Stevie McDonnell and Kieran McGeeney back-boned a strong Armagh side at a packed Celtic Park. “I think we had to delay the throw-in, because there was that big a crowd...and we beat them. Days like that gave me huge confidence going forward,” Liam adds. After tailing away, Derry failed to make the league final and lay in wait for All-Ireland champions Tyrone in the championship. Derry had their homework done to a tee. There was a militant month of preparation, said Hinphey. In the build-up Crozier informed him hed be picking up Sean Cavanaghhe played in the half-forward line. The Derry boss even had Mark Lynch mimic Cavanaghs dummy at training in preparation. “It didnt do much good, I fell for the dummy a couple of minutes into the game,” Liam laughs. “But, that gives you confidence from the manager asking you to pick up a role like that. “Tyrone that day, they played into our hands. Mark Lynch went deep and Davy Harte followed him. No harm to anybody, no matteryou are All-Ireland champions or not,you leave big massive gaps in front and you have the two Bradleys playing and Big Enda, you are going to get cleaned out and thats what happened.” Derry held the Red Hands scoreless in the first half and ambushed them, before going out against Donegal in the next round. “We didnt play anywhere near what we could have. I think we put that much into the Tyrone game,” Hinphey feels. “There was a quick turnaround for the Ulster semi-final and we maybe couldnt get up to that same level.” The following season, Derry took Dublin down to the final stretch in a pulsating All-Ireland Quarter Final and in  beat Kerry in the league final. Liam and Clare then took off for an eight-month trip to Australia, where he hurled with Sydney Shamrocks. “I came backand did a Master degree and was living up in Belfast. Damian Cassidy was the Derry manager and I was back playing for Derry. James OKane was taking the hurling and my Da was helping him out, so I was trying to keep my toe in there too,” Liam explains. The groin injury flared up and it was time to decide. He chose the hurling path that took him around many a corner and as far as last month and his decision to call it a day. One hour of chatting later and Hinphey is still content. “Theres a group of us and we have been friends since  years of age and still are,” he said of those he hurled with in the club. “It was great and a childhood well lived. I couldnt have played for so longClare wasnt so selfless and happy for me to put so much into it when she was looking after the children.” Its now father time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat has remained wedged on mud flats in the local river close to Bay Road park since August . Over eight weeks later, it has become somewhat of a visitor attraction and captured the imagination of the city, with people regularly checking to seeit has finally taken to the seas again. Back in August, the Derry News discovered that the boat, named Day Dawn N , had been purchased for pound from a fisherman who didn’t want to see it decommissioned, according to the Assistant Harbour Master at Portrush. googletag.cmd.push It also came to light that the new owner was considering converting it into an Air B ’n’ B. The saying goes, ‘a high tide lts all boats’, but it appears Day Dawn is not for moving.  Pat Carlin of Foyle Search  Rescue had initially predicted that the vessel would set float again in mid-September with rainfall accounting for a higher tide. Now, in his view, the boat is in such a ‘bad position’ that it will require a larger vessel to dislodge it from the mudflats or floods which nobody wants to see because of the associated risks. Mr Carlin explained that the highest tide in the Foyle this year was about three metres and it never rises much above that. googletag.cmd.push That still wasn’t enough as the vessel is stuck solid on a bank which is visible when the tide is out. “The tide isn’t big enough to lt her,” said Mr Carlin. “We, unfortunately, don’t have the facilities even at high tide to pull her out. “You can see that she’s a trawler, and with the size our own boats, we don’t have any facilities to bring her out. “It’s a very bad position they’re in, it’s in the shallows, the water is not deep enough to float a vessel of that size. “The high tide is not lting her there, she’s stuck.     “You’re going to need a bigger boat to pull her out, I’m sure it’s possiblethe harbour were involved or someone .” As there is no immediate danger to maritime traffic ,it’s not a matter for rescue services. Mr Carlin added: “It doesn’t come under the remit of RNLI, the Coastguard or ourselves because it’s not an emergency. “We’ve done everything we can since the initial call-out to make sure they were safe and observed all the time and we do our checks every time we’re up and down the river to seeanyone is onboard. “I’m sure from a private perspectivethey wanted to employ somebody they might be able to move it but I’m not % sure.” If released from the mudflats other dangers come into play, he said, as she may be holed underneath or damaged which could mean there’s a possibility of sinking. Mr Carlin added: “If she did in the wrong place you’d have a bigger problem then. “It’s up to the captain and those onboard to decide what they want to do now. “If we had a big enough boat I’m absolutely sure we’d make an attempt to do it but we just don’t have a big enough boat. “We’ve had the maximum tide of the year so far, a . metres tide but she’s just not floating in full tide. “Unless they get a massive flood and a very high tide she looks like she’s stuck there. “As high as we’ve gone this year is .m .m and it’s not budged. “And eventhe tide is that high and you go to pull her off, she’s obviously still stuck there somewhere because she’s not moving.” He continued: “I think it has a . metre trawl which is the depth from the waterline down to the bottom of the boat. “You need a maximum of that to refloat her andyou’ve only got a m tide and she’s stuck on a bank then there’s not much manoeuvre for her to refloat. “It’s not looking good for it at the moment being there so long.” A spokesperson for Foyle Port said they are in regular contact with the owner of the boat. “He informs us that he is working on moving the boat when the conditions allow him to do so,” the spokesperson said. “The boat is not derelict nor is it a shipping, navigation or environmental risk and is anchored safely, so the responsibility is on the owner to move the boat when he can.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New housing at Wapping Lane is one offour new regeneration projects which are helping to change the face of the Fountain area of the city. Wapping Lane runs from Abercorn Road up to the Fountain. The Derry News revealed last week that full plans have been submitted to the local council for a new poundm apartment complex between Carlisle Road and the Fountain. If approved, the complex will incorporate  apartments and business space in buildings along Hawkin Street and Fountain Street. googletag.cmd.push Work is already underway to give the Cathedral Youth Club in the heart of The Fountain a facelt, and designs for a new building for the New Gate Arts and Culture Centrein Hawkin Street, which will incorporate a  seater performance space, dance studio, tuition and art rooms, as well as a cafe and rooftop terrace, are nearing completion. In addition to this, plans for a row of new two-bed homes to replace the derelict housing in Wapping Lane are due to be submitted for planning approval by local developer the Martin Group in the coming weeks. Kyle Thompson, Co-ordinator at the North West Cultural Partnership, which is based in The Fountain, said the once rundown area will become an attractive place for people to live and work. googletag.cmd.push I have been liaising with ious statutory agencies and private developers for a number of years, highlighting the need to address vacancy and dereliction in the area. Now that all the properties in Wapping Lane are under the ownership of one developer they can progress to the next stage and we hope the proposed two bedroom homes will attract people into the area to become part of this vibrant community. This area is also steeped in history and is one of oldest inhabited places in the city outside of the City Walls. Hawkin Street actually appears on some of the very first maps of the area.     For many years, the Fountains reputation was synonymous with interface attacks, but Mr Thompson believes the recent work of the North West Cultural Partnership and the New Gate Arts and Culture Centre to celebrate the history of the area has helped restore a sense of pride amongst the residents. There are a lot of misconceptions about The Fountain, but providing people with information about its history and culture and showcasing it in a positive light we can show them that this is a vibrant community that is a very attractive place to live. The Housing Executive houses here are in good condition and there is a waiting list of people wanting to get houses here. The Fountain doesnt have any antisocial activity or crime, it has a great primary school, a youth club and an arts and cultural centre so its a great place for raising a family. It would be great to see some people come back to the area or new people to come and join the community here. There is a small population and in a lot of cases kids grow up and move into the area themselves- they dont go too far. You have your family living around you and it makes the area very safe because everyone knows each other and they look out for each other.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning a wedding is a major event in anyone’s le but little did the Churchill girl think that her trip down the aisle with her intended, Eric Moore from Letterleague just outside Letterkenny, would first begin in the classroom where she works. These uncertain times have affected everyone in so many ways but you can only imagine Nicole’s shock when she got to work last Monday only to find out that the pupils and staff had a lovely surprise waiting for her. googletag.cmd.push Her wedding was due to take place in St Columbas Church, Churchill, but the new Covid- restrictions which came into force last Wednesday night meant that only six people could attend the event. The couple decided to postpone the big day as a result but Gartan principal Joanne Gildea and fellow teachers, Clare Murray and Chloe Rankin, aided and abetted by Nicole’s mum Pamela, who also works at the school as secretary, and of course the  pupils, prepared an early wedding present. “We are focusing a lot this year on wellbeing, emotional and mental health so the children decided to hold a party for Nicole last Monday morning to cheer her up. We had cake, cocktail sausages, finger food and made a presentation of flowers, choclate and a gt as well as a card signed by all the children in the school. It was quite an emotional occasion but everyone enjoyed it,” said Joanne. googletag.cmd.push As an extra bonus the school gave Nicole Friday off - well who wants to work on their wedding day  In a special message, Joanne summed up the feelings not just of the school community but the entire population in the Churchill and Gartan areas. “We thought it would be a bit harsh asking her to come on on the day she was supposed to be getting married. At Gartan NS we wish Nicole and Eric all the very best as they make new plans for their special day. We know you will be a beautul bride when you say  I do. The dficult decision to cancel will be worth it in the end.”     What a lovely start to the week by all at Gartan NS - a heartwarming and memorable gesture in these challenging times.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tylor Cartin will feature on Tricked-Out Tractors, which has brought together a dream team of petrol heads who have been restoring beloved vintage tractor models, building custom one-of-a-kind monster machines and crafting bespoke rebuilds. The Claudy woman became obsessed with cars as a child after accompanying her father to car shows and rallies and picking up tips as he worked in the garage at the house. A week after finishing school, Tylor surprised the staff at the local Ford garage by turning up to ask for a job, and she says the industry has been very welcoming overall. googletag.cmd.push When they saw a girl, they asked are you sure about this  she said. I told them this is what I wanted to do. That was about eight years ago now. Whenever I went to tech in Nutts Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Any time I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. I certainly didnt find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl and would think, can we curse in front of her  They didnt know what way to take me, but now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great. googletag.cmd.push Master mechanic Tylor will be joined in tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers on the show by restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland in County Down and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise. The Claudy woman says the trio work well together on the show. Were all on the same wave. I think its because were all in the same state of mind, were interested in what were working on and what we want the tractors to finish up like, she said. Theres nothing hugely challenging because between the three of us we are able to work things out together. If someone is struggling with one thing, the other two jump in.     Tylor, Darren and Stephen on the show. The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines. Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show. From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around. In the first programme, to be aired on Monday evening, Irish tractor pulling champ, Darren Bailey brings in his monster powerhouse machine, The Challenger, so the team can help him get it into shape for the new season. With three All-Ireland Championships under his belt, this time he needs to make sure his tractor is bigger and better to hold onto his title. Tylor describes the scenes viewers will witness on Monday night as being a real learning experience. I liked working on Darrens tractor, it had a lorry engine on it, she said. To have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing. It was all custom made and Im really into that. It was just a complete learning curve. Even the tractor pulling sport itself and the standards they have to keep themselves, to keep within the rules thats all stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. The first episode of Tricked Out Tractors will be on BBC One NI at .pm.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In tribute to the local mans efforts, one of his neighbours, Anaeleigh McCormick, put a post on Facebook about him on Friday and it received a huge response. googletag.cmd.push Anaeleigh described Leon as a great wee man. “Leon worked for many years in Tesco and has been retired a few years,” she said. “He was a daily gym attender until Covid arrived with us. He may well fall into the category of being vulnerable to Covid. “He could have retreated to his home and waited for this storm of le to pass. However that’s not how he is. “Leon decided that it was important that he continue his exercise every day and so took to walking the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. “Many would say that golf is a good walk destroyed but Leon noticed the amount of litter that lay on our paths and so ordered his stick for lting litter. He happily spoiled his daily walk and has been lting every day since, some days he tells me that he can get up to three bagfuls. googletag.cmd.push “As the appearance of the area began to improve and the summer months were with us, Leon took to trimming the hedges.“He has become the caretaker of our community.” Anaeleigh said Leon had a simple reason for doing what he does. “When I asked him what he was doing he said I’m lting the area up. “Single handedly, one piece of litter at a time, this is what he is doing. “He said you seeyou improve the area a little bit at a time it lts everyone up and everyone starts to contribute. Everyone starts taking better care of their own gardens and properties.     “He told me that a few young people in their foolishness had spoiled a planted area and that he felt it was better to fix it up again. “He started at it himself and a few neighbours then joined him and they ed it to its former glorynot better. You see it helps everyone he said and the young people seen it was important to everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The grant would be available to people who are unable to work because they have been told to self-isolate due to close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-. SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan, who is the partys Social Justice spokesperson, said he was disappointed with a response from the Department for Communities to an Assembly question calling for aself-isolationsupport grant for Northern Ireland, in line with counterparts in the UK. Mr Durkan said: “We remain the only devolved administration not to offer this crucial grant. googletag.cmd.push By makingself-isolationfinancially unviable we run the risk of putting people in the desperate situation of choosing between protecting others from the risk of Covid- or providing for themselves and their families. Mr Durkan said the Department of Communities had responded to his question with a vague acknowledgement that the grant will remain ‘under review’ and signposting instead to the Discretionary Support Grant. This non-repayable living expense grant, which I have no doubt has helped many throughout the pandemic, has marked limitations. Most notably the eligibility criteria states that a household cannot earn in excess of pound,, locking many families out of critical financial assistance. googletag.cmd.push “People cannot afford dither and delay when it comes toself-isolationsupport, this is something which needs introduced with immediate effect - as has been the case in England, Scotland and Wales. It would now appear the North will lose out on this important scheme. The circuit breaker has placed Northern Ireland under some of the most stringent restrictions on these islands. People who are doing the right thing byself-isolating to prevent the spread of the virus should not have to do so to the detriment of their finances.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Setanta Construction specialises in the design, manufacture and construction of a wide range of timber frame homes. It has secured new contracts with two famous hotels, Claridges Hotel in London and the Chateau la Coste hotel in France. As a result, the company will be creating  new jobs at its workshop in Magherafelt. Mark Gribbin, Director of Setanta, said it was a sign of the local companys growing reputation in the construction world. “Following great success in the Northern Ireland market in recent years, we knew that we could go even further and grow our business in GB and Europe,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We identied a niche in the construction market and through Invest NI’s RD support, we have developed a new large construction components design, which enables us to construct the components in Magherafelt, and then deliver and install them on site. “It may seem simple to many but our customers are delighted as it enables us to move on and off site quickly and can aid in the construction of a building very quickly.” Mr Gribbin said the new manufacturing process as helped them secure the new projects. “Following our success with Claridges Hotel in London, our most recent project in France was designed by one of the world’s leading architects, Richard Rogers Architecture, who has worked on projects including the George Pompidou centre in Paris and the Lloyds building in London. googletag.cmd.push “Interestingly, we were able to organise and win our most recent deals in France using Zoom and hope to do more of this in the future. “Word is spreading quickly and we notice a marked increase with enquiries for our services and look forward to recruiting and welcoming new staff to our team.” Invest NI has offered Setanta pound, of support towards the creation of the new jobs. Dr Vicky Kell, Invest Northern Ireland’s Director of Innovation, Research  Development, said Setanta was already well established in the Northern Ireland market and recognised that in order to increase export sales, it needed to develop new solutions by investing in research and development.     “Our RD support has assisted the company to develop a unique new off-site solution, a dormer window system. “The dormer windows are fully manufactured and assembled in its workshop, transported fully built to site, and bolted into the main structure of a building. “This has reduced the company’s time spent on site from weeks to hours, reducing cost and has signicantly increased Setanta’s productivity. “Investing in RD to develop such an innovative product has provided a unique competitive advantage for Setanta and has enabled the company to win signicant contracts, most recently in Great Britain with Claridges Hotel in London and in France with Chateau la Coste. “Due to the uplt in business, we are also supporting Setanta to welcome  new staff to its team to help keep up with demand. “The company is an excellent example of recognising the importance of investing in RD to maintain a competitive business beyondCOVID-, helping to build resilience and grow,” added the Invest NI representative.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two people in the car and the driver of the bus were taken to hospital.Twelve pupils were on board the bus with two treated at the scene by paramedics with a third taken to hospital with non-le threatening injuries.

That road can be a slippery one at times and there have been a few accidents on it before.Cllr Gallagher also praised the quick response of the emergency services including the air ambulance.

Despite constant promises from the EA and their contractors we are still no closer to getting this issue resolved.ldquoConsidering the number of our parents who will be losing their jobs during this crisis it is unconscionable that those being paid a regular salary are failing to deliver a service.On Friday Education Minister Peter Weir visited The High School in Ballynahinch where he opened a new ICT suite and met with staff and pupils.Mr Weir visited classrooms and spoke with the pupils, asking about how they were operating in bubbles.The board of governors and the principal, Mr Paul Marks, also had a chance for a meeting about the new mid-term arrangements and how this would affect the pupils.Mr Marks said afterwards: ldquoToday was a chance for the Minister of Education to see how schools are operating under Covid and the arrangements we have put in place to allow safe teaching and learning for our pupils.ldquoI am really pleased to have Minister Weir here as I got to show off just what a wonderful school we have and how great our children are. I am really proud of what we have achieved here and hope for even greater things to come.A number of other local principals have commented on the extended Halloween break.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, said the timing of the closure would appear to be appropriate, given the rising number of Covid- cases throughout Northern Ireland.lsquoWe have been extremely busy to ensure that the school is a safe place for staff and pupils. We have tried to keep the school fully operational and have been working closely with the Public Health Agencyto deal with the cases that have presented, he remarked.ldquoWe would like to thank our parents for their patience and understanding in responding so promptly to communication from the school and PHA during these challenging times.ldquoI want to pay tribute to our students, particularly those taught in bubbles, who have coped admirably with the lsquonew normalrsquo. For our Key Stage  pupils, the break is welcome.Mr McCann continued: ldquoHowever, while the timing is right from a public health perspective, the Ministerrsquos announcement last Friday regarding exam arrangements, specically concerning GCSE Maths and GCSE English, has heightened anxiety among pupils, parents and staff as they work to prepare for an exam in January.ldquoI also want to pay tribute to my staff for their continued effort through what has been the most challenging time in their careers. Their work in creating a safe learning environment has been tremendous.Mrs Maud Perry, principal of Down High School, described the current situation as ldquoconcerning and hoped that the transmission of the virus will reduce as a result of this extended half-term.ldquoMy main hope is that everyone in the school community remains safe, she said. ldquoIt is important that all people in the district do their utmost to comply with regulations and act in a socially responsible way.ldquoThis has been an especially dficult start to the school year and I want to commend my colleagues for the very professional and dedicated way in which they have coped with a wholly dferent school experience.ldquoThere are many uncertainties at present, not least the situation in relation to public examinations. I hope the awarding bodies provide clear and helpful guidance to teachers, pupils and parents as a matter of urgency. The lack of clarity to date has heightened anxiety for young people, parents and teachers.Mrs Perry added: ldquoSchools have worked extremely hard to welcome pupils back to structured face-to-face learning experiences and pupils were thoroughly enjoying their school experience, albeit it very dferent.ldquoI really hope that we canto what we do best after this lsquocircuit breakerrsquo. Children do need to be in school for so many social, emotional and educational reasons and I hope that we canenergised on November .Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, also welcomed the extended Halloween break and said students deserved a ldquomuch-needed rest from the pressures of school le.He continued: ldquoThe mental impact of Covid- on our young people cannot be underestimated at this time and we need to look after them.ldquoNow is the time for students to breathe again and to look after themselves before ing to school on November . We would encourage all our young people to adhere to public health guidelines during this period.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle High School in Downpatrick, said the school had adhered to official guidance to mitigate risk and keep everyone safe.ldquoWhile our pupils welcome and deserve the extended break for Halloween, it canrsquot be said for us as a school and for other schools in the community, who were preparing to continue teaching remotely, he said.Mr Maguire said that from next week, students would be encouraged to log on to continue their studies, ldquoirrespective of the Ministerrsquos advice.He continued: ldquoWe have allocated a large number of IT devices to enable our children to engage and we continue to source these devices to ensure no one misses out.Mr Maguire said thatschools could not reopen, Mr Weir should allow them to teach remotely.ldquoWhile there is nothing like face to face teaching, itrsquos the best option as opposed to a further extension to the break, he continued. ldquoSchools are under immense pressure to deliver content and prepare not only for GCSE GCE exams, but to educate children as a whole in a very tight window.ldquoI would welcome DE CCEA to look at this urgently, the current changes are not near enough. Children are anxious and worried. A bold decision needs to be made in respect to how schools prepared for exams.ldquoIt seems no one is listening to those people on the ground, in the classroom working with children, delivering two year programmes and trying to deal with Covid.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe have a considerable number of pupils sitting GCSE science papers on their . They are not being prepared the way I want them to be prepared, how others previous to them were prepared. They are not getting a fair chance at this exam paper but yet weare told to continue aseverything is normal. Itrsquos not good enough.Mr Stephen Taylor, principal of Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, expressed his concern about the loss of learning for students.However, he believed the welfare of all students and the wider community was the priority and the decision to close schools on the basis of medical advice was correct.ldquoIn Blackwater Integrated College during the past eight weeks much work has been done to ensure staff and students are set up for remote learning through Google Classroom for an eventuality such as this, he said.lsquolsquoWe have made sure all students have access to Google Classroom from home should this period of closure extend beyond the two weeks by lending out iPads to many students and working closely with students to ensure they have access to high quality online learning.He added: rsquorsquoBlackwater has been fortunate as a school that no member of the school community has tested positive since restart and I commend everyone associated with the college for their hard work in ensuring a safe environment for all.rsquorsquoMr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar, said he recognised Covid- had greatly impacted on the entire school community.ldquoWe are determined to help all our pupils bridge the educational gap they have suffered since closing in March, whilst also supporting their emotional and social needs, he said.ldquoWe understand the frustration of families with schools closing but this decision is an attempt to keep all members of our school safe and avoid longer closures.ldquoOur Year  pupils are due to sit exams in the November series however, we have had no update from the Minister of Education on contingency plans. I am genuinely concerned as to what will happenwe do notin November ora pupil, or whole class, have to self-isolate.ldquoI am also frustrated at the Ministerrsquos response regarding the summer exams. The expectation to sit full GCSE courses in a number of subjects, including Maths, having missed face to face teaching for four months, places further pressure on pupils.ldquoOur pupils are important to all of us as iniduals, we know their hopes and aspirations and aim to help them achieve these. They are not simply another number or statistic.Mr Hanna continued: ldquoAs principal, I feel we are fighting not only the virus, but the decisions from the Minister of Education who, rather than supporting, is pushing against us. The gates of St Colmcillersquos may be closed for a while. However, we will continue to support all our pupils through online resources.ldquoWe have ensured all pupils have access to Google Classroom and online Maths programmes whilst providing tutorial videos to help our parents understand how pupils access these.He added: ldquoSt Colmcillersquos High School will continue to support all our pupils, parents and staff during and after this closure, working together to prioritise our pupils.Shimna Integrated College principal, Mr Kevin Lambe, said the school would be treating the two-week closure as a holiday.ldquoWe know our staff and students, especially Years  and  who have been back since August , are more than ready for a real rest, he said.ldquoOur support staff and premises staff have been back for even longer and teachers were working away preparing for this very strange year. The two weeks are holiday and schools will not be delivering remote learning.ldquoHowever, staff have shared with students ideas for good things to do during the circuit breaker and have provided guidance to help our examination year students to take the initiative and make good use of their time.

Province-wide, a total of  dogs were euthanised last year, with Ards and North Down Council the only local authority not to destroy any animals.Councils do not have powers to seize dogs from homes or euthanise legally dangerous animals without a court order, while people whose dog strays and is seized by a council dog warden could receive a warning or fixed penalty fine.Last week, local politicians supported a proposal to examine why the number of dogs the council destroys is so high, with the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreeing that officials consult with both animal charities and local police.Councillors say they are keen for the PSNI to crack down on puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown said there should be ldquoextreme concern that substantially more dogs are put down in the local council area and is pleased that the local authority is to work with others to reduce the number of dogs it destroys after backing a motion he tabled on the issue.It urged council officials to consider ways they can bring together strategic partners such as dog wardens, local kennels, animal welfare officers, police and animal rescue charities to address the issue, including through tackling the illegal and unethical breeding and sale of dogs, particularly online.Cllr Brown described the number of dogs the local authority destroys as ldquoparticularly worrying considering the recent increase in dog theft and illegal puppy farms.He said while there are always situations where a dog may need to be put down due to ill health, efforts should be taken to keep the number of animals euthanised as low as possible.ldquoEven many old or aggressive dogs who are often put down can lead fulfilling lives under the right circumstances, usually with the help of specialist animal charities, continued Cllr Brown.ldquoUnfortunately, Newry, Mourne and Down Council sends less than five percent of its dogs to animal charities while in most other areas itrsquos between  and %. In addition, the local authority sells % of them to the public while in other areas itrsquos around %.Commending local dog kennels for finding homes for so many dogs, Cllr Brown believes that by working more closely with animal charities, the council could reduce the number of unwanted dogs and subsequently the number that are put down.ldquoI am pleased that the council can begin to work strategically to find a forever home for every dog possible, regardless of age or disposition, and am pleased that officials will consult with animal charities on how the number of dogs euthanised can be reduced, he said, also welcoming a commitment to work with police to halt puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Cllr Brown said he was also concerned that many other local councils in Northern Ireland had not claried why figures for the number of dogs they destroy are so low.He added: ldquoI am worried there is a lack of transparency in how some councils report their numbers as many did not write back to Newry, Mourne and Down Council when asked for clarity on how they manage unwanted dogs. Whilst this doesnrsquot excuse our districtrsquos overly high figures, it does bring into question why other areas are so low.ldquoI would like to see all un-homed dogs who are healthy enough not to be put down found a home, eventhat is with a specialist charity which can deal with dangerous or aggressive animals. I hope to see progress and a reduction in the number of dogs euthanised in our area in the months ahead and I look forward to working with the council to achieve this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down hurlers’ victory over Derry secures promotion  ","story":"FOR several years, Down have made it to the door of NHL Division A, only to miss out on entry at the final stage.However on Sunday, they finally gained promotion courtesy of victory over Derry at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh.Down boss Ronan Sheehan and his charges have come so close in recent times, without taking that final step.On Sunday, all that was forgotten, as they got their hands on the cup and the ticket to the higher stage.ldquoTo finally get over the line means everything, Sheehan beamed afterwards. ldquoWe made a big decision this weekend in the U-s when we didnrsquot play Phelim Savage and Ronan Costello.ldquoThat was probably what proved to be the dference today.

lethal banger, believed to have been imported from Germany.The device was placed inside the box by three teenagers who were spotted running away and when the banger exploded, large chunks of metal and

greater need than Downpatrick for a bypass.They are still seething at Down Councilrsquos decision to push for by-passes for both towns, a move they believe is tantamount to disaster and will almost certainly result in both schemes never being constructed.However, the publication of the new planning paper has given them renewed hope because it makes it quiet clear that while a by-pass is not the

numerous objections to the goalposts.Mr Alexander said he had been contacted by three families who felt the posts were too close to houses lining the field.Calling for an immediate consultation

I fear for the industrythe current lockdown is extended.Equally concerned is Stephen Magorrian, co-owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, who warned of ldquocarnagevenues were not allowed to reopen in December.Under the new restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive the entire hospitality sectors is closed apart from food deliveries and takeaways.Speaking yesterday, Mrs McCaugherty said it was a ldquovery stressful time for owners, staff and customers.ldquoItrsquos a case of here we go again. I know itrsquos nobodyrsquos fault, but we canrsquot keep going on like this, she said. ldquoWe were due to hold a wedding reception here today, but it had to be cancelled. To be told the previous Friday that you canrsquot have your wedding is just dreadful.ldquoWe have had to move dates for other weddings, but we will lose a signicant amount of business.Mrs McCaugherty said all of the Millbrookrsquos  full and part-time staff were currently being furloughed, apart from some administrative staff.ldquoWe are a family run hotel and one of the biggest employers in Ballynahinch. We try to look after our staff and treat them like a family. I appreciate how dficult it must be for them.ldquoThis is a bigger blow to them than the lockdown in March. They canrsquot believe it is happening again.Mrs McCaughtery said the hospitality industry was being unfairly treated compared with other sectors of the economy.ldquoI think there is a sprinkling of unfairness in all of this, she continued. ldquoWhy, for example, can you go into a shop and move around the place, but are not permitted to come into a pub or restaurant and have something to eat or drink ldquoWe have done everything that was required of us and more. Before we reopened in July we put in sanitising stations and observed correct distancing all the other guidelines. We went above and beyond what was asked.ldquoBusiness was good after the reopening. We had lots of staycations and overnight stays. The East Out to Help Out in August proved busy, as it was for our sister hotel, the Ivanhoe, in Carryduff.ldquoWe introduced live outdoor music, which people enjoyed even in slightly cold weather. People need to be together and are providing more than just food and drink.Mrs McCaugherty praised the support offered by Hospitality Ulster and the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, which, she said, could not have been more helpful.She was also hopeful of better times ahead. ldquoThis is definitely the most challenging time I can remember. But have worked and lived through the Troubles and I am confident we can get through this, she said.ldquoNext year is building up to be busy, which is great. We have to be positive.Mr Magorrian said the closure was ldquodisappointing but somewhat understandable given the rise in the number of Covid- cases.However, he warned that the industry could not survive many more lockdowns.He said the current closure was more dangerous than the one earlier in the year because of changes in the Governmentrsquos furloughing scheme, which would place a greater demand on employers meeting the cost of staff wages.ldquoI hope that everyone sticks to the guidelines this time. It is essential that everyone does their bit so that we can open for business in December and over Christmas, he said.ldquoIf we do not get that business then it will be carnage in January and many establishments will not survive.

It was confirmed at the time that permission was quashed as the result of a procedural error in relation to the papers before the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with Lidl consistently arguing that its current base is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.The store argues the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Planners have confirmed that they have received a number of objections about the proposed new development with those concerned arguing that the proposal is not in keeping with the residential nature of the area.In addition, they claim that the closure of the existing Lidl store will have a detrimental impact on Newcastle town centre and surrounding inconvenience stores.Concern has also been expressed about the proposed storersquos impact on traffic, the potential for increased flooding and the impact of selling alcohol, particularly to young children, with objectors also arguing that Lidlrsquos proposal is contrary to planning policy, is not in the interests of the community and will impact on the residential amenity of Shanslieve Driveresidents.Recommending that the new supermarket should be granted outline approval, planners say its their opinion that the proposal is acceptable, having assessed it against planning policy and taking into account the input of consultees.Conditions attached to the outline approval recommendation include the net retail floorspace of the new store shall not exceed , square metres and that no goods or merchandise will be stationed or displayed in the forecourt.Opening hours are limited to am to pm from Monday to Saturday and from pm to pm on Sundays.Store deliveries are not permitted between pm and am with onsite floodlighting only operational between these hours.Planners are insisting thatoutline approval is granted at todayrsquos meeting, no development activity or demolition work, ground preparation or vegetation clearance can take place until a final construction and environmental management plan has been submitted and approved by the Planning Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Newcastle.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions street collection raises £500 for diabetes charity  ","story":"A COLLECTION organised by Newcastle Lions Club on Saturday raised almost pound for charity.Newcastle Lions would like to thank everyone who donated and stress that all the money will be going to a designated charity.Newcastle Lions, and other Lions clubs throughout Ireland, have been targeting the problem of diabetes this year.World Diabetes Day takes place on November  and last Tuesday Dr Kieran Walshe spoke of his personal journey with type  diabetes.He said that it had taken  years since insulin was first discovered for it to be delivered safely.Today, due to advances in bio technology, patients are controlling their blood glucose using a glucose sensor and a Bluetooth-enabled insulin pump from an algorithm on their mobile phones.Although this is a good news story much more needs to be done as the incidence of diabetes is increasing in both the developed and underdeveloped world.

Instead, the committee asked the government department to carry out restocking which it has thus far failed to do.Cllr Curran believes that a restocked river, in tandem with enhanced angling facilities, would attract local, national and international anglers.He says the river is a key tourism asset but has not had signicant amounts of money invested in it over recent years, suggesting that the waterway has the potential to become of the key jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown.ldquoThe Quoile offers so much potential and there is much scope to invest in this fantastic facility, Cllr Curran continued.He added: ldquoAngling is very much part of the tourism offering in South Down. It is an important recreational sport and the Downpatrick river could be transformed with more investment and restocking.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that at some point in the future it could host a major angling competition.

I was a little bit more patient in the game with Carrick.ldquoWhen Nav [Navid Nasseri] cut down from the left for my third goal, I would usually have been busting to get into the six yard box, but instead I hung back and when the ball came in, I tried to direct away the goalkeeper as much as I could.ldquoThe first two goals were really well-worked. Kirk Millar and Conor Pepper combined well down the right for both. Conor played the ball exactly where it needed to be for my second.Waterworth said with football having been missing from local fansrsquo for so long, the Blues were keen to put on a show last weekend.ldquoThe fans havenrsquot seen any action at Windsor for a long time, so we wanted to perform well here. Irsquom playing in a really good team and getting plenty of chances.There are four of us playing for that number nine position. I probably could have scored more because some good deliveries came in.ldquoWith a little bit more conviction I could have come out with a few more. Irsquoll not be too hard on myself but.The early signs for this season once more bode ominously for the Blues rivals in the battle to land the Gibson Cup once more. However Waterworth thinks they can get even better.ldquoWe are good when we keep the ball and play through teams. Carrick are a tough team to play against, but we gave them the chance to grow into the game.ldquoWe worked hard to establish the early lead and I donrsquot know whether some of us took the foot off the gas a bit after that.It is something we must recty going forward but. We canrsquot afford to do that, because teams will hurt us.ldquoThere is no question we became complacent once we went two up. We were not picking up second balls, and they began to hurt us so that is a lesson.The Bluesrsquo Killyleagh-born manager, David Healy, paid tribute to evergreen Waterworth after his match-winning feat.ldquoAndy does that. He pops up in the right areas, and again Andyrsquos goal ratio over the last three, four, five years since I have been here has been just incredible.ldquoI think actually in that time, his all-round game has improved in the last  months to two years.Hopefully we can keep adding goals to Andyrsquos tally here.Waterworth will hope to keep his great start to the season going when the champions go to former boss David Jeffreyrsquos Ballymena United in the Danske Bank Premiership this Saturday.The former Northern Ireland U- international, who previously had spells at Ards, Lisburn Distillery, Hamilton Academicals and Glentoran, first came to prominence during a successful spell in the Amateur League with Kilmore Rec.The striker scored the opening two goals on Saturday after he got on the end of crosses supplied by Conor Pepper.A Caolan Loughran penalty for Rangers reduced the gap to - at half-time.

The subtext to this was ‘so why worry ’The RHI scandal was bad enough, but now we have the latest scandal over wind turbines where, officials and politicians in Northern Ireland once again defied the norm to keep us out of line with the scheme in the rest of the UK. The outcome of this was a subsidy which dwarfs the benefit renewable energy produced. It is estimated that this action has led to £ million a year cost to UK consumers.These two scandals have been seen by some as incompetence, by others as outworkings of an economic nationalism of not only Sinn Fein but also the DUP. Tellingly, no minister has fallen on their sword over these scandals which, had they occurred where in the UK would have undoubtedly been the case. Nor has any civil servant ever had to account for them.I do not believe these economic disasters for the UK will be forgotten. As a small region we have cost the nation dearly and amidst a rising tide of regional sentiment in England, Scotland and Wales, the DUP may well have presided over the fracturing of the Union as we know it. The lack of contrition speaks volumes.Thomas Robinson JP, Larne——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Growing up, his dad had more than one knocking about the yard – with Aaron himself all too keen to get into the driving seat any chance he could get.As he grew up, the interest in tractors remained – and he wasn’t just looking the top range vehicles, vintage was just as cool. This was the philosophy when he spotted a model rusting away in the hedge of a fellow enthusiast’s yard one day.A tractor swap later would reveal this old model to be a unique  Fordson F with a strange three-point linkage system.This was something dferent, but it desperately needed fixing upit was to hit the road again.That’s where the Tricked Out Tractor team come in – but will they be able to teach an old engine new tricks while still keeping it’s vintage feel And when owner Aaron from County Armagh shows them an interesting signature on the side of the tractor the gang call in an expert to find outthe tractor could be worth a lot of money.Together master mechanic Tylor Cartin from Claudy, County Londonderry restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland, County Down, and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise have been tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers.The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series.

It has big entertainment value and you might just learn something about tractors and the history of tractors too!”Darren Bailey said: “It’s amazing how we have taken tractors destined for the scrapheap and transformed them into basically shiny new shoes again.”The final programme, Cruisin’ In My ‘, a family heirloom tractor is now in the hands of -year-old Jason McVerry from Belleeks, County Armagh, who wants to have it tricked out.

Growing up, his dad had more than one knocking about the yard – with Aaron himself all too keen to get into the driving seat any chance he could get.As he grew up, the interest in tractors remained – and he wasn’t just looking the top range vehicles, vintage was just as cool. This was the philosophy when he spotted a model rusting away in the hedge of a fellow enthusiast’s yard one day.A tractor swap later would reveal this old model to be a unique  Fordson F with a strange three-point linkage system.This was something dferent, but it desperately needed fixing upit was to hit the road again.That’s where the Tricked Out Tractor team come in – but will they be able to teach an old engine new tricks while still keeping it’s vintage feel And when owner Aaron from County Armagh shows them an interesting signature on the side of the tractor the gang call in an expert to find outthe tractor could be worth a lot of money.Together master mechanic Tylor Cartin from Claudy, County Londonderry restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland, County Down, and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise have been tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers.The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines.Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show.From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around.Tylor Cartin said: “In this series I’m the chief mechanic technician. I do the engine work, anything mechanical on the tractor that needs replaced. You have to have a strong backbone, but I just have had so much craic working with the guys.Stephen Lennon said: “This series is something new and completely dferent. It has big entertainment value and you might just learn something about tractors and the history of tractors too!”Darren Bailey said: “It’s amazing how we have taken tractors destined for the scrapheap and transformed them into basically shiny new shoes again.”The final programme, Cruisin’ In My ‘, a family heirloom tractor is now in the hands of -year-old Jason McVerry from Belleeks, County Armagh, who wants to have it tricked out. For this International , new metalwork, windows, and doors are just the beginning of the transformation. Tylor thinks up some modern touches for this classic tractor, with some encouragement from tractor pulling expert, Darren.

AP Photo INA, POOL, fileA new BBC documentary retells the story of a group of labourers from Northern Ireland who found themselves stranded in Iraq after they went there to fit out Saddam Hussein’s palace.When the painters and decorators were in Baghdad in  the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait, and with war on the horizon, they found themselves at centre of international hostage crisis.One of those men was Bobby Buchanan from Armagh, who left his we and two young children at home to go to Iraq for what looked to be a lucrative job.In the hour-long documentary which airs on Monday night at .pm on BBC One NI Bobby said a lot of the decorators working on the Mivan project in Baghdad were familiar with each other: “We’d all worked together before. “We’re a mixture of Protestants and Catholics, all working class, I’d worked with them for years, all good lads.”Peter McNally from Portadown was excited about the job in Saddam’s palace. He said: “I’d loved going away to work, dferent jobs, dferent people, dferent towns.“When we started working for Deluxe decorators it was just all local work and then they got in with Mivan and we started doing jobs in England and Germany and into Europe and then into America. The money was better when you were going away.“We were approached to go to Iraq, I says ‘I’ll go to the moon’.”Michael Sands who was an engineer with construction and fit out company Mivan said: “I’d absolutely no concern at all coming from Northern Ireland. We’d all lived through the Troubles. I was  in  so I was well used to the Troubles and a militarised country. It didn’t have a bearing on my decision to go.”Bernard McKeever’s we Sharon was a bit more apprehensive: “From the very start I didn’t want him to go. I knew there was something going on to do with oil. He said I was reading too much into it.“It just happened to be the night that I recorded the news that was when it came out to say [Saddam] had signed a peace thing with Kuwait, they weren’t going to invade the country over oil. [Bernard] says, ‘you see, everything’s fine’.Bernard himself recalled: “I thought, ‘it’s going to be good money, it will set us up and hopefully everything will go from there’.”When they arrived in Iraq, where they were put up in a luxury hotel, the men observed that the people were enjoying being out on the streets after the end of the war with Iran.Bernard said: “Everywhere you went at every junction or every roundabout there was a mosaic of Saddam Hussein so he must have been a popular guy. In the later days we learnt from dferent people just how afraid they were of him.”Fellow decorator Michael O’Neill, one of the youngest of the crew, said: “He controlled the radio, he controlled the TV, as the man said to us, ‘the walls have ears’.”The team of labourers from NI were tasked with fitting out Saddam’s palace in Baghdad, a job which required bulletproof windows made in the Harland and Wolff shipyard as well as ornate marbles and granites.Peter admitted to using a common decorators’ trick of hiding their signature under layers of paint: “My name is all over the palace behind the walls, it’s probably still there.”When they weren’t working the men were able to let their hair down in the Mivan social club. Some footage of their social gatherings feature in the documentary made by Tern Television.Sharon said: “They were totally oblivious to what was going on. There was nothing on the news there. I was getting the BBC world news at home.”Back in Northern Ireland those tuning into the news learnt that Iraq had invaded Kuwait and warned foreign powers not to intervene.Bobby said: “The news we were getting, we thought it was more of a skirmish rather than a real invasion.”The local newspaper reported that Kuwait had asked for Iraqi military aid and Baghdad had responded positively. Michael commented: “[Saddam] invaded but he didn’t tell his people that. His own people were oblivious to that because they weren’t getting any outside news. You’d no internet in them days don’t forget.”He added: “On the high rise buildings there were anti-aircraft guns, there was a barracks beside the palace, you’d have seen the recruits training. It was not an army, it was just people conscripted, all shapes and sizes – big, small, fat, skinny, it was so hilarious. Some had boots, some had trainers, some had nothing on their feet. These people weren’t ready to fight a war.”Foreigners in Iraq were told they wouldn’t be able to travel until things were resolved. At the time it was reported , Britons were stranded in Iraq, virtual hostage to Saddam Hussein.Grenville Redmond, former director of Mivan, said: “Saddam would have referred to us as his special guests.” Painter Paul McCabe said: “It didn’t matter who you were, you weren’t allowed to go anywhere. We had to move out of the hotel and move into staff houses that were owned by Mivan and dferent countries. Nobody really knew for sure what was happening.”The decorators stopped being paid but when they refused to work they were told they wouldn’t be given VISAs to go home.It also became more dficult to get in contact with loved ones back home.“You just had to keep trying and trying,” said Bernard. “It maybe took a few days.”Sharon: “It went down from having a telephone call every second day to nothing. Looking back on it now it was terrible, having that dread every day, and maybe not even sleeping for a few days.”Bobby said: “Money was getting tight at home. I was playing for Armagh City at the time, they actually organised a charity thing and they used to send money home to my we. They used to give her £ a week which was fantastic. It was much appreciated.”With Allies sending troops to the Persian Gulf, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein warned of deadly consequences of western intervention.Michael explained how the men stayed up to date with what was happening: “We used to smuggle our radio into the palace and we’d listen to the home service. “It was what was coming fromthat we were worried about. The coalition coming in and invading Iraq, or bombing, or whatever, because we were near the complexes that would have been hit.” Paul said: “My main worry is they would start something before we got out. If the war started when we were still there we were going to be in danger.”A plan had been drawn upwar should break out they’d make for the border in cars.Peter commented: “Some fellas where more scared than others, the only time that it got a wee bit [scary] was whenever I seen the tracer shells lighting up the sky practising for the planes coming in.“I remember one night when the storm started, there were about four or five dferent thunderstorms, we woke up and thought they’d started bombing.”Sharon, who was back home in NI, said: “Every day you were waiting on a call saying they’d been taken , thinking they were never coming back.”In October  Saddam agreed to release all Irish citizens over . John McCausland, a carpenter from Co Antrim was one of them.Paul said: “When John got out that gave us a little bit of hope.”The documentary unearths some touching moments that made the news back home.Footage is shown of Peter receiving a th birthday card and Bobby getting a painting from his daughter Carrie after missing her first day at school.Though the most signicant footage is of PM Margaret Thatcher’s resignation in November .Some of those stranded in Iraq felt she’d been too hostile to Saddam and hadn’t helped their case.Shortly after John Major took charge Saddam announced the hostages could go home.Bobby recalled the moment he was reunited with his family at Aldergrove airport: “I was so glad to be back. “It did change my thinking on le. I was definitely more of a mellow person. Nothing annoyed me much. “The we would probably say I’m back to myself now.”Bernard said: “The innocents always suffer. It’s just something that links us all together for the rest of your le.“Iraq will always be in my heart.”Peter said: “It makes you appreciate what you’ve got.”  \"       \"  Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"health board may meet more frequently due coronavirus ","story":"Betty’s work ethic earns her BEM honour   MP dismisses critics of abstention on vote for free school mealsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsHealth board may meet more frequently due to coronavirusThe Board of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust may have to consider meeting more frequently to discuss the pressures being placed on the organisation by the coronavirus pandemic, its chair has confirmed.By Adam MortonThursday, nd October , : pmUpdated Thursday, nd October , : pm  \"       \"  Addressing a virtual meeting of the Trust’s Board, Roberta Brownleedescribed dealing with both the normal running of the Trust and the extra pressures as a result of the pandemic as a “challenge”.“COVID- has taken over our lives,” said Mrs Brownlee.“While we continue to do the day-to-day work a lot of time is being taken up with the pandemic but at the same time we are still trying to run our day to day business and that is a challenge.\"“We may have to consider how often we meet.

Stephanie was in a position of vast knowledge and expertise for her field, but lacked the business acumen to launch her business. That’s where we were able to step in and help.    “Through the completion of her business plan, we were able to finalise Stephanie’s business proposition.
